You're going to disappear into that chair, but I appreciate.

I know, I'm on brand now, Peter.

You -- I'm on brand, thank you for that. Did you realize that John Stankey in AT&T and
Time Warner and Warner Media are just this little company and you're going to
smush them?

We certainly don't think of them as a little company.
We have a lot of admiration for them. They're an important partner and important
client, so we certainly don't view them that way.

I want to talk to you about the role of advertising in this world that we're discussing.
First, let's talk about politics.
When I asked you, come on, I didn't realize we had this discussion, but now we're
going to have it. For the last month, I think, your bosses Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl
Sandberg have been defending your policy towards political advertising which inCarolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Eversonshort is don't lie unless you're a politician, and it's okay to lie in and out. Are you
going to change that?

We have no plans to change the policy. I think this is a really diﬃcult one to think
about and it's a lot more than meets the eye, what you hear in the headlines? We
strongly believe that we should not be the arbiter of truth and if you try to attempt to
fact-check political ads, it becomes extremely diﬃcult to determine, if I'm a
candidate and I say I'm going to lower the deficit by X billion or trillion I'm not going
to raise taxes who can fact-check that.

But you guys do fact-check lots of stuff, and it is diﬃcult for you and you struggle
with it, but you can certainly try to do it.

We certainly can, but politics is a very different ball game and we really believe that
Washington D.C. needs to put regulations. As a citizen and I'm sure you want this too
probably everybody in this audience we'd like to know that the ads we see from our
political candidates are truthful.
That's really important for democracy.

You want the government orbiting what's truthful or not?

We think there should be regulation. We do not think Facebook should be choosing
what is true or not.

And just to be clear, so there's no plans to change your policy, but I keep hearing
that you are maybe looking at tinkering with it.
May be limiting the level of ad targeting that you guys offer. What's the status of that
discussion?

So there are -- there have been a lot of reports about the changes we may be
considering, and here's what I would say, we're looking constantly at how we canPeter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafkamake political ads more effective on the platform. So for example we launched the
ad library, so now Facebook is the most transparent ad platform in the world. Every
candidates ads are up there for seven years, every issue ad how much they're
spending, who they're targeting all of the creative, we think that's important.
And so when we -- some of the rumblings you're hearing in the press is really
actually the continued work of our team as we talked to people around, what could
we be doing better than we're doing today.

And I translate that is, that's the thing you're talking about.

We are not talking about changing the targeting. I know that was reported.

That's not on the table.

That is not on the table.

What about a blackout period on political advertising before a certain month before
an election?

There are a number of changes. More transparency is definitely how do we make it
more clear to a person that when they see an ad from a political candidate it is that.
It has not been fact-check, it's a political ad. We're looking at making that more
transparent, that's probably the area that I would say more than anything.

What about the idea of whether it's limiting ad targeting or anything else of making
political advertising less eﬃcient on Facebook, so it's harder to do massive
campaigns at scale that's really just impossible for anyone whether it's the
government or you or third-party to monitor. I think that's the big overall concern, as
the scale you guys are at there really isn't any way you can A/B test stuff live on the
ﬂy, you could do thousands of campaigns a day and that works really well for you
guys when you're selling all sorts of stuff.Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn EversonAn FCC commissioner saying the rules for selling soap should not be the same rules
for selling political ads and basically you should sort of make your ad machine work
less well?

I don't this is about making the ad machine work less, well. I mean we are a global
company and so when you think about the importance of political advertising
around the world, I can tell you there are about 70 to 90 major elections a year in
countries around the world and there are people with the smallest constituents in a
local Mayoral Race or a City Race that are happening around the world that depend
on our platforms to get their message out. Today in the democratic primary that's
happening here in the United States, the democratic candidates have spent more
than President Trump has and we think that's important, because there's a very big
democratic primary occurring a lot of candidates and they need to get their
messaging out, and let people decide what messages are resonating? What's
truthful? And that is not the role that Facebook should be playing and interfering
with democracy.

Do you agree with Sheryl and Mark? Do you do differ in I mean, I know it's probably
hard to say.
You disagree the CEO live on stage. If you share their opinion?

So here's what, I do share their opinion and here's why? My -- sometimes my first
reaction admittedly is like can't we make a change here, right? So I'll give you
another example, when that when the Pelosi video was running around and
somebody doctored her up.

A deep fake, but doctored.

Right.
So, I mean they doctored her up. I have to tell you that initial emotional reaction,
because I want the platform to be safe and secure and protected was can't we take it
down? That's a normal human reaction, probably many of you in the audience may
have had it, and then I always my education around how complicated these issues
are goes from this to this on everything. Well, if you're going to take the Pelosi video
down then why have we not taken down the millions of videos that have been
doctored about Trump, about Bush, about Obama, about celebrities. We haven't.Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn EversonSo why do you take it down right there and that emotional instinct. And so when the
political ad, when the Biden ad happens and the Warren ad, I think they're -- it's very
natural for people to say, wait a second how is this happening? Why is this? Can't
you do something better, but the real test of whether or not a company stands
behind their principle, we allowed the Warren ad to run that said we endorse Trump.
I know that's factually incorrect.

So did anyone who looked at it, because they said this is fake.

But it didn't -- we ran it. That's the point we stuck to our principle that --

But one is an intentionally provocative things saying, we're going to critique
Facebook's advertising policy, the other one was meant to deceive people.

We don't know. Does Mark -- does Mark Zuckerberg actually know, factually know.
Was he in the room in the room with Trump and the Ukrainian government or Biden
or Biden's? No, we're not in a position, and I don't think -- I think once and I've had
so many conversations about, because everything from dinner parties to client
meetings to everything. Once you say to somebody do you really want Mark
Zuckerberg or Facebook Executives to be the arbiter of political truth? The answer is
typically no.

It seems like the ongoing discussion we've had with Facebook now for many years,
which is we built this thing it's really big. We're not comfortable really making
decisions about how some parts of it run and that's kind of weird on the outside to
say you built this thing that you don't want to operate anymore.
You want someone else to operate it?

We don't -- we want help with regulation. We have asked Mark has been very clear.
He wants help with regulation around privacy. Take GDPR out of the AU.
We rolled that out globally. We think more regulation around consumer privacy
would be a good thing. We want regulation around data interoperability and beingPeter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Eversonable to port your data from one service to another. We want it around election
integrity, we wanted around content policies.
We think that that would be very healthy for the entire ecosystems develop, and if
one company is making decisions and another company is making different
decisions, we don't think that's actually very good for the development of the
ecosystem overall.

Okay, we're going to leave politics for now. Maybe it's going to come back.

Okay.

Let's talk about broader advertising questions. We're going to hear -- we're going to
be talking about this throughout the next couple of days, the role of advertising in
the streaming wars world, in a world where people have a lot more choice about
what they watch and how they pay for it, and I'll just keep saying it again, right with
160 million Netﬂix subscribers ad free, Disney has 10 million ad free subscribers,
Disney Plus, Warner Media's first product they're rolling out as a new company is an
ad free product. It looks like when people are saying look the best stuff we're going
to give you is stuff you're going to pay for and then also you're not going to watch
ads. And I'm wondering, how you think as a professional ad seller about that
proposition?

So look, I think it depends on the lens that you're looking at these.
The -- if you ad up the subscription streaming services right now. If you want Netﬂix,
you want Hulu with ads, you do Disney Plus or adding them up. These are expensive.
They're very expensive for the average consumer.
I mean, you could ad up and over be over $300 a month, if we start --

You don't have to do that. You pick the stuff you want.

Exactly, but we're in a world where we're saying consumers are going to have all this
disposable income. We take a little bit of a different point of view.Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn EversonWe take the point of view that an ad-supported model is one that we deeply believe
in. Number one, it allows us to provide all of our services for over 2.7 billion people
for free. Number two, it allows businesses to have access to tools for free. So we
have 7 million advertisers and we're really proud of that number and it's an
important constituent base, but there's a 140 million businesses that use all of our
tools for free to grow their --

-- that advertising is not a bad thing.
It supports the company I work for. We have sponsors sponsoring this event, but it
seems like there are generations of consumers expect things to get stuff on demand
whatever they want and get it without ads.

So we don't see that, we actually what we hear -- the one of the biggest complaints
about our advertising and it's certainly getting better, but I've been at the company
for 9 years and I remember being shocked at this was if you know something about
me Facebook, why can't you serve more relevant ads, and if you look at the
evolution of the advertising on Facebook and Instagram, I meet people all the time
that tell me I bought my sneakers, I bought my shirt, I bought a bag, I found a
suitcase that I loved. I found packing bags, I found pet products, meal plans that is
delighting the consumer and that is a multi-generational thing.
Yes, if they're relevant and useful. If they're disruptive, so if you take somebody that
just bought a car and they get served up car ads, that's really irrelevant to them. They
think it's a waste of time they're annoyed. If they just bought a particular car and they
see a generic ad from that car company and that car company doesn't recognize
that they a new customer they're annoyed.

Or I bought the Zappos shoes and Zappos then who is advertising their shoes to me
for the next year, I like that to the stop. Can you stop that?

I'll work on that.

Talk to them about that.

I'll work on that.Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Okay.

Yes, but I think people want relevant ads, they want ads that are useful that delight
them, that provides some type of service to them, and I think if that we used to in the
advertising and I've been doing this now for a very long time. Advertising, we used
to think we had a right to interrupt people. We're giving you the content for free, so
you better sit through our interruptions and listen to our ads.
It's no longer about that. Advertising needs to be built for people, not at people and
that's the big shift that's happening.

You guys have taken many different runs at video, we're going to -- talking a lot
about video here today. Facebook Watch is sort of your current --

Yes.

-- product you're using just to get into that space. How is it going? You don't hear
much discussion about it in these circles right now?

So, Facebook Watch has been out there for a couple of years, and I would tell you
the first year was really slow like by our definition, because --

Slow in terms of users?

-- in terms of to figuring out growth and do we have the right fit and all of that? And
then about a year ago August, so now about 15 months ago, what we describe as
product market fit. When we start seeing the thing take off, and now we about have a
720 million people that come a monthly basis to Facebook Watch.
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter KafkaThose are people who click on the tab.
They're not watching it in the news feed.

That's total people watching it with an in-stream as well as Facebook Watch.

So if I watch a Facebook Watch video that is served to me the news figured counting
on that?

Yes.

Okay.

And that is the content within Facebook Watch and what we have found is it's an
open platform. We're experimenting with a mixture of types of content. We have
some originals, so like Sorry for Your Loss, Return the Favor is like those are doing
incredibly well. Then we have music videos, we have short sports clips, we have
some obviously clips that are created by creators in that universe.
So it's a mixture of content that people are finding to be very valuable. We're in the
early stages admittedly. I mean some of our competitors have been doing video
longer than we have, but we're definitely pleased with the traction. Marketers are
starting to buy into it in a much more significant way.
Some of them want that format, because it's more like TV. It's 15 seconds.

Right.

The sound is typically on and that's a comfortable format.
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn EversonAs a consumer, I know that on watch TV, I'm old click the cable box and nor I go to
Netﬂix, I go to watch television, I will go to watch videos somewhere. Are Facebook
users coming to Facebook to watch videos, it's an afterthought?

So we have about a 150 million that do some type of that on a daily basis.

Some type of --

Watching like coming specifically to watch --

I want to watch this show with you, as going to think it.

And so, it's small when you compare us to a lot of the other platforms, but we're
starting to see that behavior and the goal is to build that behavior over time.
So that's a very deliberate action that people are taking.

And is it a different kind of video than I would expect to watch on YouTube or Netﬂix.
Is it is this something's Facebookey [ph] about it or is it a video is a video?

Yes. So I think Netﬂix is really much more about curated more professional, you
typically longer form content as their core base and that's the same with Hulu and
many of the other streaming services, and we're not trying to compete with that.
I don't think you are going to see us in the -- it writing huge checks for content to
compete with the streaming services. I think what

You guys have made some bids though for video, you bid for cricket in India.
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter KafkaWe have we've tested some sports bidding.

What's the thinking behind bidding on sports for you guys?

Well, what we were trying to understand is do people want to come and watch a full
sporting experience or do they want the highlight clips, and so we're testing both
right now to see what people prefer, and of course the strategy is potentially
different in each country.
So, we operate essentially everywhere except China and each country the sporting
development and what we're doing is very unique. But I think, you'll see us more
shorter form videos, there'll be some scripted material like we have some of the
originals, but it'll be much bigger mixture.

And just deal back to sports one more time, you bid that, you made that cricket bid.
Does that mean that you could bid for a Direct -- the Sunday Ticket or what we
consider a major professional American sport?

I don't think you are going to see us do that in the near term.
I really don't. I think you're going to see us focusing much more on the highlight
clips which seem to be doing very, very well. And also are economically in our favor
compared to all of the folks that are bidding very significant dollars for the other
stuff.

So whenever this Thursday Night NFL package comes up, it will be a digital rights
thing Twitter's done it, Amazon's done it.
You guys have looked at it, you're not going to go for at this time?

I think it'll be a big question as to whether or not we go for it?
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn EversonThat's a fair and ambiguous answer. Big picture question, Mark my time frame is
mixed up, but I think it was this calendar year said we're pivoting all of Facebook and
we're going to be moving more towards private communication.

Yes. That was this year.

That was this year, thank you. It's been a long year.

Yes.

For many people.
If he's saying look the future of Facebook is private communication. You and I direct
messaging each other et cetera, instead of posting stuff on the news feed, that also
seems like that's a big issue for you, because you're trying to reach many people the
same time. How do you adapt to that world?

So I think, when he said that, it gets interpreted as the whole thing is moving towards
this one-to-one communication and what he was really trying to say is that there's
going to be sort of two different types of experiences that he sees as critical going
forward, the Town Square type of environment where you post on Facebook or
Instagram, you can post publicly or you can post just to your friend group, or you can
just post to yourself frankly, but that will continue to exist. It's a huge part of our
business, and a growing part of our business.
But then there are an increasing need for people to want to communicate in a much
more intimate way and that's more to the living room experience where is
Messenger and WhatsApp? And that's between people, people in small groups are
also as people in businesses. We are definitely early, early days on figuring out what
the advertising model is going to be in that more besides.

But you think there will be advertising in that world?
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn EversonYes, but I think it's going to be a maybe perhaps a broader view like advertising I
don't even use the word advertising, I typically use the word marketing when I speak
with our CMOs and Clients, because it will be everything from customer service
experiences. So KLM, the airline was one of many airlines that moved a lot of their
customer service into Messenger.
We had a lot of the fashion brands move their fashion shows. They did them on --
obviously the runways, but they also brought them into Messenger. So, you're going
to see businesses really experiment with how do I create an experience that's
worthwhile to people in that messaging environment?

It's traditionally, right. That's been very, very hard to bring advertising into, there are
ads in Gmail and there were ads in AOL instant messenger and those really didn't
take off the scale and people don't want them.
If I'm talking to you via direct message, I don't expect to see an ad, don't want to see
it.

That's, right. And we have, we have followed the same playbook almost with
everything we've done, which is built for consumers first. And if it takes years to
figure out the monetization then so be it.
I mean we bought WhatsApp many years ago, everyone's waiting for that to be
monetized and we're still focused on the consumer experience there. We have
launched a couple of services for businesses, we've launched a small business
solution for WhatsApp, which is growing incredibly fast. I mean again, outside of this
country many businesses are running their entire business on WhatsApp. And then
we have for Messenger, we have click to Messenger ads, we have click to WhatsApp
ads.
So if you're in your Facebook or Instagram feed, a business can ask for permission to
engage with you in that more private environment and those are growing very
effectively. But you're going to see us walk very slowly on the monetization
advertising model in those privacy environments.

But you're going to get it there?

I believe we will. Yes.Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Right now, Instagram is your big growth engine?

So Facebook is also growing and continues to grow.

Instagram is going much faster?

Instagram is still, in terms of if you look at the portfolio 7 million average. Well 140
million business is for free that use our platform for free. 7 million advertisers across
the family, 3 million are utilizing stories.
And so there's a big delta there, 4 million have not opted in to try stories and so you
might ask well why? Why is that when one billion people a day are using stories? It's
a new format, so it takes some time and what you see is a lot of the disruptor a lot of
the direct to consumer brands that don't have the legacy systems in place. They're
racing into that. They're getting tremendous value, the pricing is lower, because
there's not as much demand. So that's going to be a really important growth engine
for us going forward.

Did you hear them, some of those people who got into Instagram and Facebook
early in the direct-to-consumer a lot of them advertised on broadcast got
blossomed?

Yes.

Now, saying the pricing actually isn't cheap anymore, it's quite expensive and
actually, we're not paying rent in a store, we're paying it to you guys and we need to
find other places that aren't as expensive. Do you worry that the pricing actually is
sort of going to squeeze some of those early folks out?

So, a few things on the pricing and how direct-to-consumer disruptor brand. So first
of all, many of them come in when they first start up and they buy what we call CPAPeter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn EversonCost Per Acquisition, which means I will pay you Facebook or Instagram X dollars,
when you bring me a customer, and that's how they do that sort of hockey stick
growth, right? They've got a formula they get VC funding and they grow, and then
they sometimes like hit a plateau or a wall and like then what do they do? And really
the next level of sophistication is to start thinking about the lifetime value of that
customer.
60% to 80% of the value of -- is really comes from your top 20% of your customers.
So what happens is those disruptor companies they acquire a lot of customers, but
then only that tier, there's a tier that's super valuable, we have to learn to engage
with them. And so then they often plateau and then they hit another exponential
period of growth. And so we see the different I would say phases of client
development, we also see them expanding to TV to podcast other -- and we think
that's healthy.
We just not --

You are not worried about them leaving Facebook, Instagram for cheaper stuff for
stuff that's more eﬃcient?

No, I have never told a client. You should only be spending on Facebook and
Instagram. First of all, that would look utterly ridiculous, because I'm a marketer and I
know what you have to do. We should be on multiple platforms get your message
out.
And we do that too. We just relaunched our brand, and we have a ton of creative
work out, it's on billboards, it's on TV, it's on other platforms, like that's a good thing.
And so we always try to figure out from a client's perspective. What is going to drive
the clients business? What is the most effective way to drive growth for the client?

What point does Instagram become a bigger business than the original Facebook
app?

I think that you will see that both of them -- I mean they're both incredibly fast
growing businesses.
Instagram is a significant contributor we don't break it out. And so that's I can't say
anything more about the revenue.Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka

Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Tell me when it's going to crossover?

I can't break the revenue. You know, I can't do that.

Thought of ask. Why is Facebook now all capital letters is that your goal?

I would hope that you would talk a little bit more than just the capital letters of the --

You lay the whole thing on me. I'm a busy guy, always I saw that this now the
Facebook capital?

So we did this for a few reasons, we're behind on our branding and marketing. We --
my first handful of years, we didn't even have a CMO at Facebook.
There was a belief because it was very Silicon Valley intact that the product does its
marketing.

You're on the internet, even in a company --

Well, we're advising clients on how to grow their business. We didn't really take our
own medicine. And so we got a CMO and then we have now our second one
Antonio, who's been there for over a year.
And the reason for the whole branding of the company and rebranding is really to
be much more transparent and clear. There were a lot of people that didn't know
that Facebook owned Instagram. There are a lot of people that didn't know
Facebook owned WhatsApp. And when we're espousing transparency in everything
that we are doing, we've got to be transparent about that.
Carolyn Everson
Peter Kafka
Carolyn EversonSeems like people not knowing that Instagram, that Facebook owns Instagram could
be a plus for you guys right now. You've got a lot of folks anecdotally saying I don't
want to participate in Facebook. They're bad, they're not sure why or they think that
elected Trump or whatever it is? And then they're posting on Instagram. Are you
worried that when you underscored this actually is owned by Mark Zuckerberg, that
that actually has a negative effect?

We believe that it's important to be transparent about that, we think it's absolutely
worse.
If somebody would be like, well, I didn't know Facebook was involved in Instagram
and have something blow up that way. That's way worse, so we felt a real need to be
very clear about that. So that's the reason for the company branding, we also are
more than the blue app, right? We are -- I mean, we were internally people were
always like, are you working at Facebook? Are you working at Instagram? And we
work across the whole family of apps and so it was time for a company message. We
have to tell our story better, our story's been told a lot frankly through headlines, for
the last two-and-a-half years and it's about time that we try to tell our story a little bit,
what we stand for what are the family of apps and services and the real test will be in
about five years to see whether or not, the brand work has actually landed and what
people think of it, it's not going to be just because we put out a new logo, it's a lot
more than that, we have beautiful creative work as I said appearing all around the
world.

But this is a reaction to the last three years of press and headlines and actual actions,
right? This isn't just a press creation that you guys people have a negative opinion
about you. They're reacting to real things in the world.

We definitely had real issues and challenges over the last three years. We've made
mistakes, we've had to do -- we have to do things better.
I think our company is an entirely different company than it was three years ago. And
I wouldn't have stayed at Facebook. I've been doing this for 26 years, my reputation
means a heck of a lot to me within the marketing community and business
community. When I have to look at a CEO in the eye, and tell them we've learned our
lesson about 2016, we're now trying to do everything we can to protect elections.
We have learned our lessons about privacy and we have to be much more
transparent give users more control and accountability. If I didn't see those cultural
shifts, it would have been really hard for me to be able to look people in the eye and
have the confidence to stay at the company. So, it's a very different company than it
was three years ago.Peter Kafka

That's a good segue to open this up to the audience.
I have questions if you guys are shy. Race? (Question And Answer)

No, it's okay.
I'll just lower it like this. Hi.

Hi.
So I've had more than 26 years in the business as well. My name is Marissa Freeman,
I'm the Chief Brand Oﬃcer for Hewlett Packard Enterprise and we're a big customer
of yours.

Yes.
And I've also been on both sides. I've been in the agency business, buying media
making creative and now I'm on the client side. Throughout my career and way
before I was even born there has been a pact between advertisers and media to be
truthful. Sometimes the advertisers don't really want to be, but we have to be and it's
the media companies turn that back on us, the advertiser and say it's incumbent
upon you to prove to me that, you're telling the truth.
If you're making claims about your product or your competitor, you have to have
tangible proof that we particularly CBS, I remember always fighting with them. We'll
look at and determine whether or not it's truthful. Now you talk about Facebook
being a public square and for organic content user generated yes it is. But for paid
advertiser content, where you have someone with a big purse who can inﬂuence a
lot of people it's incumbent upon both of us to protect the public and tell them the
truth.
So are you saying that because you have these little communities and small elections
that Facebook can't do this at scale. And that it's too hard to do it at scale. Is thatCarolyn Everson
Marissa Freeman
Carolyn Everson
Marissa Freeman
Carolyn Everson
Marissa Freeman
Carolyn Everson
Marissa Freemanwhat you're saying? That's my question. What is the answer here, and do you
disagree with the construct that I just set up?

So their political speech in this country has been handled very differently than
traditional advertising from HP or any partner or clients that has been the way it's
worked in this country for decades.
May I interrupt? I have also worked at agencies who do political advertising as well.
And they don't get to circumvent standards and practices?

So -- there, we have standards and practices of course to the political candidates
have to sign up for, but we are not just see you know, the ad that started this whole
debate the Biden ad was run on every single broadcast network, every single digital
platform, every cable network except for one. It was run everywhere, because we are
not allowed as an industry, the broadcast industry is not allowed to censor political
ads that's the law.
Standards and practices in censorship.
It's not, it's it puts it back on us.

Yes. And we can have those.
To provide proof of claims.

We do have standards and practices, but we have no ability legally to tell a political
candidate that they are not allowed to run their ad, and that's why we think there
should be regulation.
Right but they have to edit the ad to be truthful or at least I do in both political
campaigns and advertising campaigns. We had a reedit and omit untruths orCarolyn Everson

Hi, so going back to Facebook pivoting their strategy towards private
communication given that they were -- there's a lot of talk in the last year about the
spread of information and fake news on Facebook in the last couple of years. How is
the company planning on circumventing that, but also gearing their strategy towards
private communication, since large WhatsApp groups, Facebook groups things like
that or actually huge culprits of spreading that kind of information?

Yes.
So this is an area since 2016, like 2016 I don't think we had a big enough awareness
around the false news, fake news issues, admittedly, right? And now, would you look
at the history between 2016 and now, we have third-party fact-checkers in multiple
countries around the world. If something is deemed false, if somebody ﬂags it to us
like a person using the site, we will it immediately goes to a third-party fact-checker
and if it is deemed false, it will be labeled as such.
Right. She's asking what happens when this conversation is private?

When it goes to the private, so what we've done in WhatsApp, we've reduced the
distribution dramatically.
So we had a big challenge in India where we were having people spread
misinformation, and that was because it was an unlimited amount of people you
could send your WhatsApp messages to and now that's it's been substantially
limited, we learned our lesson in both India and Brazil.Carolyn Everson

do it at scale?

We have no way of checking a specific message with --
You're saying we're going to make it harder to make these things viral.

We're trying to reduce the distribution of it dramatically, yes.
Having run policy at my space in a much simpler time.
I'm deeply sympathetic to how hard so much of this is. Some of it is also seemingly
really easy. So when I ask about Breitbart, Steve Bannon himself called it a platform
for the alt-right for white nationalists, basically, every independent source has said,
it's a propaganda machine and yet you all are putting it in your column of trusted
news. It seems to be the simplest explanation for that, is that's what right when
politicians demand.
Is Facebook saying that Breitbart is a trusted news source or does it acknowledge
that it's a propaganda machine?

So we are not paying Breitbart, we're paying for a lot of the other news sources that
are in the trusted news. Breitbart has to agree to our terms and conditions, and if
they violate them they will be kicked out. We also have content in from the far left to
try to balance the far left and the far right. Again, we did not feel that we should be
in a position to make a judgment call to remove the far right and leave the far left in,
and so that's how we've approached it.
And I know that's it's a sensitive topic what we do have for advertisers though in the
audience network is advertisers can certainly choose to not have their advertising up
here in Breitbart.
They calling it news rather than opinion. It's one thing if you say this is a opinion and
go shop it and check it and what have you, but you're calling it news which itCarolyn Everson

answer is that we are treating it as a trusted news source?

We're treating it as a news source in the term I wouldn't use the word trusted news,
because it's all going to be dependent on how they follow our policies and if they
don't --
But you putting into this news tab, that says this is a --

So, to be clear for the left too.
Right, right.
But when you put in the news tab you are saying this is news. If we didn't think it was
news, we leave it in the main news feed. So you are making a judgment call?

We made a call to put them in as well as the far left news sources.

Okay.
Just one last very quick question. Sorry, we couldn't everybody.
You mentioned that, you spent a lot of painstaking efforts to make sure that you
bring your great -- build a great service for the consumer before you figure out the
advertising solution. But isn't much of your advertising solution taking those services
away from the consumer and asking the publisher to pay for them.
So for example, when you -- publisher would have a page that used to be and they
would make a post that used to be in the newsfeed of politicians and so on, now it's
essentially impossible to get something into the newsfeed unless you pay for it?

Peter KafkaSo the organic distribution has definitely diminished dramatically given the amount
of content in it on any given minute you or I could have about 1,500 stories or posts
if the algorithm thinks might be interesting to you or I, and so organic content has
been diminished dramatically. Particularly from marketers and sort of paid
publications, because people want to see more content from their family and friends.
And so yes, it is true that advertisers do need to pay to be have the opportunity to
get into that 10 to 15 stories that people see.
But if I choose to follow a page, right?

Yes.
I made a choice to do so, just like I made a choice to be friends with my uncle.
Sometimes maybe I want to see more content from the page that I sign up for than
otherwise, but I can't unless that -- unless they're being extorted by Facebook.

No, you can absolutely -- you can go in and put your preferences in, and tell us just
like you can tell us I don't want to hear from these 10 friends or family, I want to see
more of that content, all of that is stuff that you can customize to make your
experience better.

She says that don't extort businesses.
Alex, you didn't like that line. Carolyn, I'm so glad you came.

Thank you.

I wish we could go longer.
Thank you.
