So it's a real pleasure to have Pat and Durga with us today. Pat was going to say few
opening comments for few minutes. And then we'll jump into Q&A. And I'd also
mentioned, please e-mail, Fred or myself or Katherine, or enter it into the computer,
few of additional questions, we're sure to ask those as well. Go ahead, Pat. Thanks for
joining us.

Thank you very much, Greg. Certainly appreciate the opportunity to participate in
today's conference. But before we do get started with our fireside chat, I do want to
highlight the key themes of last week's Investor Day and provide a quick update on
our sales recovery in our two lead growth markets, the U.S. and China. I will be
speaking to some slides that are now posted to our Investor Relations website. And
so I'll start with our standard cautionary language here, as I will be making some
forward looking statements.
To summarize last week's Investor Day, we truly believe that Starbucks is stronger
and more resilient than ever. First, we've rapidly adapted to changes in consumer
behavior, leaning into digital and accelerating the repositioning of our business in
dense metro areas in the U.S. Second, we have a long runway of healthy growth
ahead, even from our current position of global scale. Third, we expect to sustain
double digit growth at scale, with improving margins and returns targeting an
ongoing growth rate of 10% to 12% of non-GAAP EPS.
So now moving to a quick sales update, starting with the U.S., we continue to expect
full comp recovery in the U.S. by the end of fiscal Q2, even with the impact of the
recent surge in COVID-19 cases, and how that has affected customer mobility in the
U.S. recently, due to various government imposed operating restrictions across
several states. Note that we saw a slight sequential improvement in comp as we
entered our fiscal Q1 from minus 4% in September to minus 3% in October, thenQ - Greg Badishkanian
A - Patrick Grismerdecelerating a bit to minus 4% in November, with further softening now in the month
of December. So our business is being impacted by the current surge, but not nearly
to the extent that we were seeing in the spring, as we've built a new level of
resilience in our operations and customers are also showing resilience, knowing that
they can safely visit our stores given our trusted operating protocols.
You'll see that we've noted compound two year comps at the bottom of the slide, as
that's what we'll be monitoring as we begin to lap material impacts of COVID-19
from last year, starting in the month of March. And to note that our two year comps
were already positive in the last three months. So let's move to China. We continue
to expect full comp recovery there by the end of fiscal Q1. And as you can see, there
is been some choppiness in our monthly comps recently. We moved from 1% comp
growth in September to 11% comp growth in October, although that included a
seven point seasonal benefits shift from September.
Then similar to the U.S. we saw a deceleration from October's normalized growth of
4% with comp growth returning to 1% in November. And in the current month in
December, we're seeing strengthening relative to November reinforcing our belief in
full comp recovery as we exit Q1, even excluding the temporary VAT benefit. And
similar to the U.S. we've noted compound two year comps at the bottom of the slide
and you can see that we've been running solidly positive there for the past three
months. So what does this mean for the quarter, our EPS guidance remains intact, as
margin strength offsets softer than expected sales. And to help with modeling, we're
now providing comp guidance for the quarter as it comes to a close with the U.S.
landing in a range of minus 6% to minus 5%, improved from Q4 of fiscal '20, which
was minus 9%. And with China landing in a range of plus 4% to plus 5%, also
improved from the previous quarter, which we reported at minus 3%. And I
confidently reaﬃrm our EPS guidance for Q1 and the full year as noted with non-
GAAP EPS ranging from $0.50 to $0.55 to Q1 and from $2.70 to $2.90 for the full
year.
And so with that, I'm happy to take your questions, what I'm first going to do is stop
sharing my screen. And as I mentioned, these slides are posted to our investor
relations website for investors and analysts to study, and really happy to now move
to your questions. Thanks very much.
Questions And Answers

Awesome. Thanks, Pat. Yeah, we also saw that from Brinker [ph] as well, that slowed
down in December and their pre-announcement today.

The other thing, I was just going to add -- the other thing was, I think, notable U.S.
retail sales were reported this morning and there was, I think, a one point
deceleration from October into November, which mirrors the slight deceleration that
we saw in our business from October into November.Q - Greg Badishkanian
A - Patrick Grismer
Q - Greg Badishkanian
A - Patrick Grismer
Yeah, absolutely. And just kind of as it relates to that, you're expecting the U.S.
business to improve at some point and recover during the March quarter. You talked
about kind of your numbers running around that negative 4% during September and
improving. But we're still a little bit away from that. So what gets you over the final
hump, what gets you over there? And is it -- what are the drivers, you think it's just
greater frequency with existing guests, is the return to a more normalized school and
work schedules? Is it a vaccine? What is it that's going to get you to a more
normalized levels?

Great question, Greg. There are really three key drivers that I would highlight, and
part of our thinking is predicated on what we've observed in markets around the
world that have these kind of searches and impacts and what we've seen is relative
to the initial surge, the impact is far less pronounced, which is what we're seeing it's
far less pronounced, not nearly as deep and it doesn't last for as long. That said,
what we're expecting in the U.S. is that there will be some relaxation of government
restrictions, as we move into our second fiscal quarter. With that, we expect also
ongoing normalization of customer routines, as we saw transpire across the summer
into the fall. And then we're not standing still, we have business driving initiatives
lined up, in the areas of digital customer engagement, average innovation and
continuing to elevate the customer experience by elevating partner experience,
which we believe is the number one driver of comps, and so that work continues. So,
really a combination of a relaxation of government restrictions, ongoing
normalization of customer behaviors and routines, and our business driving
initiatives that we have planned for our second quarter.

Okay. All right. Another question, just one of the points that Kevin made in his
presentation last week, with the potential resurgence for in-person consumption as
behaviors begin to normalize. And you've historically seen big in-person destination
customers coming to your stores. But a lot of focus has been on drive throughs this
year as well. So how do those factors balance out when you're thinking about it?

Well, I think your word of balance is the right way to think about it, because it's
important to remember that even prior to the pandemic, in our U.S. business, 80% of
our sales were -- what we call OTW, out the window. Combination of drive through
or coming into the cafe to pickup averages (inaudible). The other 20% then being
occasions that were more sit and stay occasions. And so, we've already had, I think a
pretty healthy balance between that convenience occasion. And what people have
thought of us, the traditional third place experience, the way we think about it, is it all
transactions? Whether sit and stay or out the window, our third place experience
transactions, because they all involve engagement with our partners, which is our
fundamental part of the overall Starbucks Experience. So even though we have the
leaning in more to drive through in other convenience channels, because that'sQ - Greg Badishkanian
A - Patrick Grismer
Q - Greg Badishkanian
A - Patrick Grismerwhere consumers want to be met during this time. We recognize the importance of
offering our cafes for the sit and stay experience, that customers are craving.
And as Kevin mentioned at the Investor Day last week, as we were able to
progressively open our cafes even for limited seating, the impact was immediate. So
as we've had to dial back with these new operating protocols that we've had, that's
what has impacted our business here more recently. So we fully expect that as those
operating restrictions are lifted over time, we will be able to dial back up in a way,
that allows customers who are eager to come back into the cafes, and have that sit
and stay experience to complement the more convenient occasions, that they wish
to have from time-to-time, will see that ongoing recovery in our business. So for us
it's about making sure that every Starbucks customer experience has that third place
dealing to it, because that's what our customers enjoy; that's what they appreciate;
and that's what they're craving.

Alright. So your China business back to positive comps in September, can you talk
about what if any differences that you've seen in the China recovery relative to the
U.S. recovery?

Well, there is no denying the fact, that the market itself has followed a very different
path toward recovery. The market overall has enjoyed a -- I would say, a steadier
recovery, a more controlled recovery, a more disciplined recovery. And of course
that has not been the case in the U.S. What has been an area of exposure for us in
China is the restriction on international travel. And so as a consequence, as we
worked our way back towards full recovery, the team in China has had to focus on
replacing transactions that have been displaced, because inbound international
travel is still restricted.
So the part of our business that relied on inbound international travel, whether
business travel or tourism, that continues to be a gap in our business relative to pre-
pandemic levels. But the team has innovated and worked quickly to replace those
transactions, and that was -- that is what has enabled them to achieve our full comp
recovery, as I've reinforced here by the end of our Q1, as we enter our Q2, and as the
number support.

Right. And just kind of looking at the development over the next three years, we saw
that development really ramp up, and how does that fit into unit development
income targets that you outlined last week?

Development is a critically important part of our overall growth equation. As you
know, we talked about last week, the fact that we see our way to approximately
55,000 stores globally by 2030, up from just under 33,000 today. So we have a long
runway for growth. What that looks like near in -- what we outlook here in the U.S. isQ - Greg Badishkanian
A - Patrick Grismerabout 3% growth, which I think is quite remarkable for a concept of our scale. We
already have more than 15,000 locations here in the U.S. So very substantial scale.
And yet, there remain significant development opportunity for us. Now that is largely
concentrated in parts of the U.S. where Starbucks concept is less well represented. In
the center of the country, in the Southeast and very heavily focused on drive
throughs which are high volume, high margin operations. That's not to say that there
won't be development of other concepts, in fact, as we've talked about trade area
transformation in the U.S., we've talked about a repositioning of our real estate in
those markets.
So as we close under-performing units, we will be opening new units. Some of them
will be these new formats that we've talked about, others will be more traditional
cafes, that will be, enhanced in their designed to better cater to the type of
experience. Customers are looking for, which is increasingly about convenience. But
development remains a very strong part of our overall growth equation. Not only in
China, where as you know, we're growing at a very fast pace, but also in the U.S.
which many consider it to be a mature and heavily penetrated market, so Starbucks
is still has significant growth potential.

And with respect to the U.S., it's an acceleration over what you've done historically,
like to say the last three years. So what gives you the confidence reaccelerate it now?

Good question. I think it's important to pick apart, what happened in the last couple
of years. When you look at fiscal '19, we came in at around 3%, so on the low end of
the guidance we've given 3% to 4%, but that reﬂected what I would characterize as
opportunistic closures later in the year. As the year was unfolding and we were
seeing improving performance. For example, in Q3 we posted a 7% comp in the
U.S., in Q4, we posted a 6%. So as the business was accelerating, we saw the
opportunity to accelerate some closure, just think about it, as an early innings of
trade area transformation. We didn't announce trade area transformation and the
acceleration of our plans until we were in the midst of the pandemic in June of 2020.
But even in the year before we saw the opportunity to pick-up the pace of some of
the closure, some of the underperforming units. And so that weighed on our net unit
growth in fiscal '19. And then you look at fiscal '20, we came in closer to 2%. But bear
in mind, there were two things going on. Number one, the pandemic which
disrupted our business and we had to hit the pause button on new store openings
for a while. And so, we weren't getting the absolute new store openings that we had
originally planned. And we announced trade area transformation and acceleration of
that in a very significant way.
So we picked up the pace of closures in the back half of the year. The combination of
those two dynamics yielded net growth of about 2%. And then this year, fiscal '21,
with outlook just slightly positive. And that is entirely due to the accelerated closures
under trade area transformation. Because the absolute store openings north of 800,
are very robust and we expect that new pace, that absolute pace of store growth to
continue across the planning horizon, that we've guided, with Investor day last week.Q - Fred Wightman
Q - Greg Badishkanian
A - Patrick Grismer
Q - Fred Wightman
A - Patrick GrismerAnd the closures will moderate because as we accelerate all these closures into fiscal
'21, we'll see a lower rate of what I would characterize as ongoing closures. So it's --
you have to really pick apart, what happened in fiscal '19, fiscal '20, look at the
composition of fiscal '21. And I believe that lens, even more credibility to the about
3% growth that we've outlooked for the U.S. net, over the next, well through fiscal
'24.

Greg, you're on mute.

Great. Thanks. And let me turn it over. Thanks, Fred to -- I'm going to turn it over to
Fred Wightman on my team. Thanks Pat.

Thanks, Greg.

Perfect. Hey, Pat, thanks again for the time. If I could just trouble you to -- I know that
you posted the slides on the investor deck, if you can just went through there on
your IR site. Would you mind just running through sort of the prepared remarks
again, for those final three slides? We had a few people reach out asking just for
clarifications, so it would be really helpful if you don't mind, just...

No. Happy to do that. So starting with the U.S., we continue to expect full comp
recovery in the U.S., by the end of our fiscal second quarter, even with the impact of
the recent surge in COVID-19 cases, and how that has affected customer mobility in
the U.S. recently, due to government imposed operating restrictions across several
states.
We did see a slight sequential improvement in comp, as we entered our fiscal Q1, so
that was moving from a minus 4%, as we reported for the month of September, so
minus 3% in October. That been slightly decelerated to minus 4% in November. And
we are seeing further softening here in the month of December. So our business is
being impacted by the current surge, but not nearly to the extent that we were in the
spring, as we've built a new level of resilience into our operations and customers are
also showing resilience, knowing that they can safely visit our stores, given our
trusted operating protocols. And the audience will also note, we've shown the two-
year comps, which is something that we're monitoring, particularly as we start to lap
the more material impacts of COVID-19 from fiscal '20, starting in the month of
March.
Now moving on to China, we continue to expect full comp recovery there by the end
of our fiscal Q1, which is the end of this month, end of December. And you'll see
from the slides, there has been some choppiness in monthly comps here recently.Q - Fred Wightman
A - Patrick Grismer
Q - Fred Wightman
A - Patrick GrismerWe move from a plus 1% comp in September to plus 11% in October, but that 11%
included a 7.0 [ph] seasonal benefit shift from September. So maybe normalized
more like 4%, that's slightly decelerated much like the U.S. into the month of
November, where we saw a plus 1%. And then in the current-month of December,
we're actually seeing strengthening in China, relative to the month of November.
And so that reinforces our belief in a full comp recovery, as we exit Q1, even
excluding the temporary VAT benefit. And then, so much of the U.S., we noted the
two-year comps.
And then close with that last slide, which is again posted to our IR website. What it
means, what this all means for the quarter, EPS guidance remains intact. As margin
strength offsets the softer than expected sales and actually to help with modeling
what we're providing, because we've not provided comp guidance for Q1. But as
we're approaching the end of the quarter, we wanted to share an outlook. And with
the impact of this recent surge here in the U.S., we're expecting Q1 comp to land in
the range of minus 6% to minus 5%. And in China, we're expecting it to land in the
range of plus 4% to plus 5%. And in both cases, I think quite notable improvements
versus the prior quarter Q4 fiscal '20, U.S. had come in at minus 9%. So now we're
out looking sequential improvement to a range of minus 6% to minus 5%. China had
come in, in Q4 at minus 3% and we're out looking plus 4% to plus 5%.
I also on the very last slide reaﬃrmed our EPS guidance for Q1 and the full year, as
noted on the slide, that's for non-GAAP EPS.

Perfect. Super helpful. Thank you. And sorry to make you to do that twice.

No worries.

We've a fair amount of people reach out, so just wanted to clarify that. Maybe just
one quick follow-up on the December comments for the U.S. Will you remind us sort
of seasonally what percent of mix that month is given the holiday SKU [ph]. And then,
I know you had made some comments about gift card business specifically at the
Investor Day. Any change to what you're seeing there or expectations? That would
be helpful.

So I don't know that we've ever disclosed what December is specifically. We have
talked about Q1 being a seasonally high quarter for us. So the holiday season is
important to us overall. I don't know that we've shared the specifics, but that can be -
- I think derived from some of our past disclosures, because we do provide U.S.
specific sales. So it's an important quarter to us. So, it is unfortunate that we are
seeing this impact at this time. Nonetheless, we remain confident that we will fully
recover by the end of our Q2. And then in relation to gift card sales, as you would
expect with limited customer mobility with restricted access to our cafes, where weQ - Fred Wightman
A - Patrick Grismer
Q - Fred Wightmantend to sell many of our gift cards, not exclusively, because we sell through other
channels, including digitally. But we are seeing impact, and so there will be some
impact to our gift card sales this holiday season, which will likely have some knock-
on effect to our fiscal second quarter. But I think it's early to say whether that will be a
material impact.

Perfect. And then just maybe take a longer-term view, if you look at the operating
margin. Our operating margin guidance you guys provided last week you talked
about 40 basis points sounds like it's tied directly to that portfolio of optimization.
But can you talk about the other building blocks to give you the improved
confidence in that outlook? And then how we should think about sort of the
sequencing and the impact on the P&L over the next few years?

Absolutely. I would highlight two key levers, driving that margin improvement
beyond the boost that we get from trade area transformation, as we talked about.
And that would be the stronger comp, so we've taken up our comp outlook globally
from a range of 3% to 4% to a range of 4% to 5%, there is significant operating
leverage in our business. And so that provides a significant capacity for us to make
the incremental investments, that we believe are absolutely essential to our ability to
deliver that top line. But at the same time, we are sustaining disciplined cost
management and that's across every cost line in the business.
As you'll recall from last year, we made significant progress with the deployment of
labor in our stores, with new tools that we introduced towards the end of fiscal '19.
Tools that have a machine learning capability that enable us to improve or refine the
manner in which we are allocating store labor hours, in a much more eﬃcient
fashion. So disciplined store labor allocation or deployment is an important one. I
would continue to highlight what we see by way of significant supply chain savings,
which we continue to deliver, given our growing global scale and how we're able to
leverage that to our advantage.
And the third would be, G&A, I would say that there is a new level of discipline, in
terms of how we manage G&A. And make no mistake as a growth company, we will
continue to invest in G&A, importantly in areas like technology and data analytics.
Things that are instrumental to our ability to drive the top line, but we will be very
disciplined in how we find offsets, so that we can contain G&A growth to a fraction of
our top line growth, so that we can unlock margins, margin eﬃciencies that enable
us to deliver that, that margin improvement, that we outlooked over the next three
years.

And one of the things that you just mentioned was labor eﬃciency. Subsequent to
the Investor Day, I think Kevin made some comments about moving all of your
partners to $15 per hour in terms of wage. Was that contemplated in the operating
margin guidance? And how does that sort of that commentary fit into the outlook?A - Patrick Grismer
Q - Fred Wightman
A - Patrick Grismer
Yes, it is contemplated in the outlook that we provided. And specifically provided for
in our fiscal '21 plan and underpinning our guidance for fiscal '21. As it relates to
future years, we've made provisions for those investments. At the same time, we're
continuing to work on the funding vehicles, which will include outsized sales growth,
because we do expect a return on these investments, as well as additional operating
eﬃciencies. So that work is still underway, but we remain very confident in our ability
to find the offsets necessary to pay for those investments, to deliver the top line
growth that we're out looking. And the one thing, I want to clarify for everyone is,
well, is that when we outlook for example in the U.S. 4% to 5%, that is the projection
that we're providing, that we are committing to. But as you know from this last year
pre-COVID, we have the capacity, we have the potential to deliver above that
amount. Q3 and Q4 of last year plus 7% and plus 6%, Q1 -- I'm sorry, fiscal '19, and
then Q1 of fiscal '20, before the onset of the pandemic, plus 6%.
So our business has the potential given the strength of our brand and the focus of
our investments, particularly around our partners and digital to punch above that
45%, providing the capacity necessary, but we're going to be very thoughtful about
how we pace and sequence these investments. We're very much committed to
delivering stronger wages and benefits. We've been an industry leader for years.
We're going to maintain that leadership position and reward our partners in a way
that we believe is appropriate. We're going to be very thoughtful about the pacing
and sequencing, making sure that we also have the funding vehicles to preserve the
margin guidance that we provided. But we remain very optimistic about our ability to
continue to enhance the profitability of our business, even as we make these
significant investments which we believe are absolutely essential to our brand
positioning.

Great. Super helpful answer. Thank you. One of the other things that we've got a few
inbound questions -- have to be Investor Day, was the potential licensing
opportunity, if you had alluded to. You gave some color on the potential sales and
margin impact, we do move forward with that. But can you maybe talk a bit more
strategically about why this is the right time to be exploring that process? And then
what some of the milestones are that we should keep an eye out for over the next
few years?

Absolutely. So I think it was about 2.5 years ago that company management gave a
presentation at an investor conference and unveiled the Growth at Scale agenda.
And a fundamental aspect or dimension of the Growth at Scale agenda are
streamline. It was about simplifying the business and tightening the company's
growth agenda. And in fact, over the last two years a series of transactions have
been completed. Licensing transactions, divestitures like Teavana, Tazo, Global
Coffee Alliance, which fundamentally moved the Channel Development business to
a license model. So all those transactions contributed significantly to the
simplification or the streamlining of the organization, and provided management theQ - Fred Wightman
Q - Greg Badishkanian
A - Patrick Grismer
Q - Greg Badishkanianfocus that we believe strongly contributed to the improved operating results, we saw
over the last couple of years prior to the temporary impact of the pandemic.
And so we believe that continued streamlining through these licensing transactions
has the potential to further advance the management focus and the simplification of
our company, in ways that we'll further enhance performance. At the same time, as I
highlighted last week bringing the potential to improve our margins and our return
in invested capital. So we see it as an extension of streamlining activities completed
over the last two to three years, with a potential to enhance our business. I would say
there is no special urgency and we think that these things will take time, anyway to
pull together. And to do them the right way, because what we want to make sure of,
is that we have the right partners, who have the commitment to the brand and the
capacity to invest behind the continued growth of the brand, in order to sustain the
growth of the business and realize the full potential of Starbucks.

Perfect. Greg, I think that does it. I think we're out of time.

Great, Pat. Thank you very much for joining us today. Really appreciate all the follow-
up, especially after your Investor Day, is really helpful.

Our pleasure. Thank you for having us. Have a great day. Bye-bye.

Take care.
