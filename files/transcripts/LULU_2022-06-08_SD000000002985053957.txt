Jacqueline ShadashigeFinally, the shareholder proposal. At this time we would like to invite the
representative for the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to introduce them
self and read the text of their proposal. They will then have two minutes to make any
additional comments. Operator.
Hello? Hello?

Hello. Jacqueline are you from PETA?
Hello, yes.

Go ahead.
Resolved, lululemon has pledged to uphold strong animal welfare practices. Given
the cruelty inherent in the down industry the board is strongly urge to commission a
report on the slaughter methods used to procure down to determine whether these
methods align with that pledge.
The report should also address the risks presented by the Companys sourcing of
down that are incompatible with the animal welfare practices and the Companys
plan, if any, to mitigate these risks.
Good morning, my name is Jacqueline Shadashige and Im here on behalf of People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA. Im speaking in support of our proposal
that the board commission a report on the slaughter methods used to obtain down.
lululemon asserts that is committed to obtaining down from certified ethical and
humane sources and that it does not condone the mistreatment of animals in any
form. But there is no actually evidence to support such claims and much to prove
otherwise.
PETA U.S. Other PETA entities have investigated so-called responsible and humane
suppliers across multiple industries dealing with animal derived materials. And
repeated found that standards cannot and do not eliminate cruelty.
PETA Asia investigations connected responsible down standards certified suppliers
to live plucking. A practice in which workers pin terrified birds between their legs
Calvin McDonald
Shannon Higginsonand rip fistfuls of feathers from birds bodies leaving open bloody wounds. Suppliers
even admitted to mislabeling the live plucked down as not live plucked to fool
buyers.
No matter where down is sources, birds used in the down industry are inevitably sent
to the slaughterhouse where many are improperly stunned leaving them conscience
and able to feel peel when their throats are slit and plunged into scalding hot
defeathering tanks.
Down makes up less than 0.5% of lululemons total materials. Since its such an
inconsequential material for our Company it should be easy to eliminate it in favor of
the cruelty-free alternatives already in use. We shareholders deserve full disclosure
of the slaughter methods used to obtain down which will reveal that they are not in
keeping with our Companys humane claims. Accordingly, we urge all shareholders
to vote for this ethically and economically responsible resolution. Thank you.

Thank you. This is Calvin McDonald and Id like to provide our response. Our board
of directors unanimously recommends that you vote against this proposal principally
because first we are already committed to obtaining down from certified ethical and
humane sources. Second, we strongly believe that decision about the use of
materials in our products should be made by our management and design team
rather than by our board of directors or shareholders.

Thank you, Calvin. Please note if you previously voted by proxy you do not need to
vote today unless you wish to change your vote. If you have not previously voted by
proxy or if you wish to change your vote you may cast your vote using the link
entitled vote now on the right hand side of your screen.
It is now 8:07 a.m. Pacific Time and the polls are closed. Based on the preliminary
tally provided by the inspector of election, a suﬃcient number of shares have been
voted as follows.
To re-elect each of Ms. Henry, Mr. McNeill, and Ms. Loehnis as Class 3 directors; to
ratify the appointment of Price Waterhouse Copper LLP as our accounting firm for
fiscal 22 and to approve on an advisory basis the compensation of our named
executive oﬃcers.
As suﬃcient number of shares have not been voted on favor of this shareholder
proposal. So the stockholder proposal has not been adopted. The final voting results
are subject to the final count certified by the inspector of election and will be
publically disclosed in a Form 8K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Calvin McDonaldThe formal meeting is now adjourned. I will now turn over the meeting to Calvin for
some brief remarks about our 2021 and Q1 2022 financial performance. Before he
begins, I want to remind everyone that a reconciliation of GAAPs and non-GAAP
measures is included in our Form 10K and Form 10Q and in our earnings press
releases and also that todays meeting may include forward-looking statements that
are based on managements current expectations and assumptions.
Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking
statements due to risks and uncertainties, including those explained in our Form 10K
and our Form 10Q. Calvin.

Thank you, Shannon. And good morning to all our shareholders joining us today. Its
great to be with you. 2021 was another pivotal year for Lululemon as we exceeded
$6 billion in annual revenue for the first time and are on track to deliver every one of
our 2023 Power of Three revenue goals two years ahead of schedule.
Our strong performance was grounded in staying true to our vision and values and
speaks to the enduring strength of our brand, our ability to deliver sustained growth
across the business and the agility and hard work of our teams. Id like to spend a few
minutes sharing some highlights from the year and reﬂect on the exciting
opportunity ahead.
In 2021 our momentum remained particularly strong as we grew total revenue by
42% to $6.3 billion. Our strength continued to be broad based and balanced across
every facet of our business including channel, category, activity, gender, and
geography.
We leveraged the science of feel, which continues to fuel our product innovation
engine to develop fabrics and products that solve the unmet needs of our guests
with strength across both womens and mens and within each of our four core
product areas of yoga, run, train, and on the move.
We saw our multiyear partnership with the Canadian Olympic Committee and
Paralympics Committee come to live, which will continue to be a powerful
opportunity to highlight the Lululemon brand in our technical apparel expertise on
the world stage. Looking forward, our product pipeline remains robust and Im
excited for the new innovations we are bringing to market in 2022, including our
recent launch of our footwear collection thats made for women first and new
offerings in our play categories, including tennis, golf, and hike.
Were focused on strengthening our enduring guest relationships and our continued
channel investments have engaged our guests in new and compelling ways,
meeting them from, when and how they want to shop.
Our stores continue to be an important growth driver and connection point with our
guest and we open 53 net new stores in 2021. Our ongoing digital innovation also
contributed to the strength of our omni guest offering. We launched mirror in
Canada, its first market outside of the United States.
And in 2022 were continuing to connect with our guests both new and existing in
powerful ways by offering new offerings such as the recent expansion of our like new
trade in and resale program across the United States and our upcoming launch of
our two tiered membership program later this year.
Looking at our international business we have significant runway in our core existing
and new markets. In 2021 our international revenue grew by more than 50% and still
only represents 15% of our business.
We opened 43 net new stores internationally and continue to see how well the
Lululemon brand resonates across the globe, from 31 new stores in China mainland
to continued growth within Asia-Pacific to our strong online performance in Europe
we believe our results reinforce that Lululemon is a brand uniquely positioned in the
global market place and we are just getting started outside of North America.
As we look ahead we will continue to deliver growth by engaging guests in China
mainland, growing our core markets and scaling and entering new countries across
APAC and Europe.
Now switching to our impact agenda. All our strategies are underpinned by our
impact agenda, which we first published in 2020. It said that the vision for our
potential and how we will drive positive and meaningful change in the world. Im
pleased with how weve advanced our impact agenda in 2021 and delivered on our
priorities.
We made solid progress across our be human, be well and be planted pillars, which
include building and environment that is equitable and inclusive, advancing equity
and well-being across our communities, working to prevent environmental harm and
helping to restore the planet.
Additionally we continued to invest in our people and aspire to create an
environment where everyone can thrive, make an impact and be celebrated. We
expanded our employee benefits, raising minimum wage and base wage pay in
North America and introduced more unique mental health mentorship programs
and continued to support both the personnel and career development of all our
team members.
Looking ahead were already off to a strong start in 2022. Last week we reported our
First Quarter results. Revenue grew 32% versus last year and 27% on a three year
CAGR basis, adjusted earnings per share grew 28% and 26% on the same basis.
A - Martha MorfittOur results demonstrate the strength of our business and the momentum for our
brand. This is enabled by our omni operating model, our product innovation and our
balanced approach to growth. As we look to the future Im energized by the
opportunities ahead and our significant runway for growth.
In April at our Analyst Day in New York we revealed our ambitious new five year
growth plan to double the business from $6.25 billion to $12.5 billion by 2026 using
our successful power of three formula.
Our strategy, which we are calling the power of three times tow includes a plan to
double our mens in digital revenue and to quadruple our international revenues
relative to 2021. We will achieve these goals by continuing to focus on our three
strategic pillars of product innovation, guest experience, and market expansion.
These pillars, along with our impact agenda priorities will drive our strategies for the
near and long term. Our commitment to innovation for our guests and our desire to
have positive impact on the planet and across the communities in regions in which
we operate.
In closing, we believe we are in the early innings of our growth potential and I am
confident in our ability to deliver on our power of three times two plan and maintain
momentum through an ever evolving macro environment.
Let me invite thanking our teams around the world. Our board of directors and our
shareholders for your continued support, confidence and commitment to Lululemon.
We will continue to work tirelessly to deliver for our guess our people, the
communities we serve and all of you. Well now take questions from shareholders.
Please submit your questions through the virtual meeting portal.
Questions And Answers

Thank you, Calvin. This is Marti Morfitt and I am going to T-up the questions that we
received from our shareholders. The first one is a multipart question from the
Lululemon founder, who as most of you know, is no longer an active part of the
company.
So I will start this off and then hand it off to Calvin so that we can address the various
parts of this question adequately. The first part, and Ill paraphrase, is Marti Morfitt is
now the chair of the Lululemon board, is she the right person to be the face of
Lululemon and why?
Not to bore you with my credentials outside the company, Ive been with Lululemon
for 14 years. I know the business very well. Most of those years I played various
leadership roles with the company and Im honored that the board has selected me
A - Calvin McDonaldto be in this role. So I appreciate the question and I appreciate the chance to answer
it. Ill turn the rest of these questions over to Calvin.

Thanks, Marti. Second question is how is Lululemons brand focus on diversity and
inclusion differentiating the brand in the market place?
I would say its not. Being diverse and inclusive, representing the communities and
guests we serve is simply the right thing to do, quite frankly for all brands. Well
continue to differentiate our brand through innovative product by delivering on
unmet needs of our guests, investing in the guest experience in the relationship.
These are the key areas of our brand that are unique; we believe differentiate, have
and will continue to fuel. And being a diverse and inclusive brand is just something
we aspire to be better than we are today and the right thing to do in the
communities and the guests we serve.
Third question is how does Lululemons brand statement of putting women first to
market -- sorry, let me get this straight. How does Lululemons brand statement of
putting women first to market running shoes meet its inclusion goals by excluding
men?
Ill -- first and Ill talk specifically to footwear. But being inclusive does not mean that
we will pursue every opportunity equally across the genders and launch at the same
time. We look at what the unmet need opportunities are, those may differ across
genders and will innovate and bring those to market accordingly.
In footwear we saw a significant unmet need for our female guests and our
innovation has been recognized to deliver that gap that existed in the market place
by both experts as well as our guest where weve seen an overwhelming response to
the launch of the product, which is exciting.
And we have stated that we will be bringing a mens footwear offering to market in
the future. In fact, we launched Restfeel last week, our slides. So those were both
launched dual gender with a mens and womens offering. But in the case of our
Blissfeel run, we did go first with our womens assortment because we saw real
exciting opportunity in the market place that quite frankly was not being offered and
a significant unmet need and an opportunity to be unique and different in a -- in a
very contested category and we took it.
And Im excited and excited how its resonated and we will bring mens. But as we
look at opportunities we dont put it through the filter being inclusive or not, we put it
through the opportunity or the filter of delivering unmet needs in the opportunities.
Then finally the last question, size 18 apparel uses double the cost of Lululemons
very expensive fabric compared to size 6. How does Lululemon justify forcing a size
6 woman to subsidize a size 18 person when selling both sizes at the same price?
A - Martha Morfitt
OperatorIll tackle the question. First, none of our quest subsidize the other for the -- for the
size of product that theyre offering. Ill break it down into two how we approach it.
First, its just the right thing to do is to expand and offer a size range that allows all
athletes across both mens and womens to perform in Lululemon and a brand that
gives them this similar technical performance brand product opportunities.
So expanding our size offering across both mens and womens is something weve
started a few years ago. Were proud and its doing well and resonating and it
definitely fits with the brand opportunity and the communities.
Then finally -- and how we manage it, we manage our margin through mix, which is
across categories, sizes, gender to meet our margin goals and sizing is no different
in how merchants mix to deliver on the goals that weve shared and the
commitments in our five year plan.

Thank you, Calvin. We have another submission from a shareholder and Ill just read
this and, Calvin, if you want to respond or add to this after Ive gotten through this
please feel free.
Good morning, to Lululemon management team. I am so pleased to be here. First
thing I wanted to mentioned is that when I was notified about the jobs I was
surprised but very quickly I became moved and proud.
Its a daring move but it says something about Lululemon. The past year has been a
rollercoaster and it has made me reﬂect and I actually look for -- reﬂects, excuse me
sorry -- and its made me reﬂect what I actually look for in an investment.
Throughout each challenge I see Lululemon weathering the storm and being
steadfast in long term goals. I have to say congratulations. I look forward to all the
new things that are on deck and thank you for being true to your customers. I live in
Victoria and I like to say there is a huge fan base there.
Thank you for that. Well we have no more questions or comments. Thank you for
those that we did receive. At this point Id like to wrap at the meeting and thank
everyone for joining us for your questions, your comments and your support of the
boards recommendations in the Lululemon business. Thank you, all.
The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending todays presentation.
