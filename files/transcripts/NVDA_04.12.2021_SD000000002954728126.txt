We announced some important things. Let me describe how they fit into our strategy
and highlight some key points. Omniverse, a platform to create and simulate shared
virtual 3D worlds. It connects to other worlds using USD, Universal Seen Description,
if you will, the HTML of 3D worlds. And it simulates and physically in the physically
and photorealistic way.
With Omniverse, you can connect designers using different tools into 1 world, a
shared world to create a scene or a game. With Omniverse, you can also connect
robots, AI characters, performing various tasks into 1 world, a shared world like the
BMW simulator factory. Omniverse is the foundation platform of our AR and VR
strategies.
Our design and remote collaboration strategies, our med averse virtual world
strategies and our robotics and autonomous machine AI strategies. You're going to
see a lot more of Omnibus. It's a really important platform.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12

Page 3 of 37We announced the new DGX station, the new DGX Superpod, the world's first cloud-
native supercomputer. It is now the world's first cloud-native supercomputer.
We announced 3 important new. MegaTron to train giant transformer language
models. And never the #1 internet company in Korea is an excellent example of why
domain and region-specific language model development on Superpods is
necessary and a trend. NVIDIA Clara for computational drug discovery announced
new algorithms and partnerships with Oxford Nanopore, and recursion. There are so
many more.
We announced Co-Quantum, our quantum Circuit simulation platform, running on
DGX, simulate Quantum circuits in days that otherwise takes decades. Researchers in
industry, national labs and academia around the world are investing hundreds of
billions in Quantum Research.
Quantum, Co-quantum will benefit designers of Quantum computers and those
designing hybrid GPU and quantum architectures, researchers inventing new
quantum algorithms like a cryptographic algorithm for the post Quantum world to
scientists who are simulating science with Quantum physics.
We announced Bluefield 3, our next-generation data center infrastructure platform,
isolating control from application planes to enhance security, oﬄoading and
accelerating virtualization, networking, storage and security.
1/3 of today's processing and software-defined data centers is already in the
infrastructure software and will grow substantially with Zero Trust security models.
The time for Bluefield has come.
We announced DOCA 1.0, the software stack for data center infrastructure
computing. DOCA will be for Bluefield, what CUDA has been for our GPUs. We
announced Grace, our First Data center CPU, designed especially for a giant data
scale, AI and HPC. Grace is 30x the system and memory bandwidth of our DGX, the
fastest computer in the world today, just to put that in perspective.
We'd expect to see an order of magnitude LEAP for giant AI models like Megatron
transformers. We will sample next year and ship 2023 in DGX and the giant Swiss
supercomputer called ELPS, which is going to be 10x the AI performance of the
fastest supercomputer in the world today.
One of the most important announcements is NVIDIA EGX for enterprise with aerial
for 5G industrial edge. And with aerial for 5G industrial edge. We believe enterprise
industrial Edge will be where AI makes the biggest impact. In health care, warehouse
logistics, manufacturing, retail, agriculture, transportation, the world's largest
industries.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 4 of 37We announced new customers of drive Orin and a new chip called Atlan and a
reference AAV car computer system called Hyperion 8. The announcements feature
the most powerful dynamics that are shaping the industries today.
Accelerated computing is the path forward. And not only has it kept computing
performance from plateauing, we've set computing on a new supercharged curve.
AI is software that writes software, no human can. It has profound is how software is
developed. And open new opportunities to automate tasks never before possible.
The data center is the new unit of computing. The software as a service trend has
caused software to be refactored into disaggregated microservices that can e-scale
out and run across the entire data center, like it's 1 computer.
AI and 5G are the 2 critical technologies that enterprises of the world's largest
industries need to deploy new products, services and business models. The era of
robotics is here. The first significant example is self-driving cars.
Thousands of companies around the world are building robotic services. One of the
most important missing technologies is finally here. Omniverse, a simulated virtual
world so accurately that robots can learn to be robots. Grace is our first data center
CPU is designed especially for giant scale, AI and HPC.
In addition to chips from industry partners, we now have the Essential 3 chips
needed to innovate in a diverse range of computing from cloud data centers to 5G
industrial edge. Our road map rhythm will combine CPU, GPU and DPU to deliver a
big boost each year.
We will support both X86 and arm, and many CPU designs optimized for diverse
segments of computing from Intel, AMD, Amazon, Marvell, Ampere Computing,
Mediatek and others.
As you see in my talks and announcements, I'm a big fan of arm, their CPU
architecture and their open licensing business model. We believe there are great
many new market opportunities for arm. To engage it, we will have to develop new
platforms, new ecosystems and new markets. These are things that NVIDIA excels.
We announced several partnerships to expand Arm's ecosystem in opportunities.
We announced that AWS and NVIDIA are building cloud computing platforms with
Graviton2 and NVIDIA GPU. We announced that M Ampere Computing and NVIDIA
are building reference platforms for AI, scientific computing and cloud.
We announced that Marvell and NVIDIA are building reference platforms for 5G and
cloud and 5G edge in cloud. And we announced that MediaTek and NVIDIA building
reference platforms for PC and mobile devices.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 5 of 37Our combination will accelerate and expand Arm's opportunities. Arm and NVIDIA
are great businesses separately. Together, we will create new growth platforms for
our partners and build a premier computing company for the age of AI.
We're working with regulators in the U.S., Europe and Asia to explain our vision for
Arm and obtain the necessary approvals. Discussions with regulators are expected
and constructive. We continue to expect closing in 2022.
AI, the automation of intelligence that can operate and scale out at the speed of
light is the most powerful technology force of our time. We're expanding the reach
of AI in 4 waves. First is to reinvent computing and software for AI. This led to the
invention of NVIDIA DGX, the Tensor core GPU and the NVIDIA AI platform.
The second wave is cloud and CSP adoption. The drive to maximize cloud
throughput ﬂexibility utilization led to the invention of the Ampere Universal GPU for
train and inference, TensorRT optimizing compiler, Triton inference server and MIG
multi instance GPU, Rapids data processing, and integrated cloud graphics and a
global team of accelerated computing software experts working with CSPs.
We've created so much to enable AI in the cloud. The the next waves of AI are big,
the enterprise industrial edge and robotics. EGX is our AI platform for enterprise and
industrial edge. AGX is our robotics computing -- is our robotics computing platform
for autonomous machines.
NVIDIA EGX is the AI platform for enterprise and industrial 5G edge. Every layer of
the computing stack required massive engineering and a large ecosystem of
partners were brought together so EGX can seamlessly integrate into the world's
enterprise IT infrastructure.
From the bottom up, 14 global computer makers are offering 55 new high-volume
servers designed for the world's enterprise, integrating our new A10, A30 and aerial
A100 GPUs optimized for enterprise data center environments. A10 is optimized for
AI as well as graphics. A30 is optimized for AI and computing.
Ariel A100 combines a 100, Bluefield 2 and our aerial 5G VRAN stack. All of these
servers are NVIDIA certified to run Nvidia AI and NVIDIA Omniverse, and NVIDIA
optimized VMware vsphere.
Together with Vmware, we did some great computer science. We engineered
Vsphere to incorporate NVIDIA Tetracore GPUs and NVIDIA Bluefield technologies
so that NVIDIA AI can achieve bare metal performance in a VMware virtualized
environment.
This is important because 80% of the world's enterprise runs Vmware. We're offering
NVIDIA AI enterprise, a major software product with enterprise-grade service levels
for mission-critical AI operations. And to run on top of the NVIDIA AIOS, if you will,FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 6 of 37we have the NVIDIA suite of NVIDIA pretrained models, state-of-the-art AI models,
designed for production and performance optimized to deploy.
There are many personas of AIs that we offer, but think of it as site, speech,
language, animation, understanding and recommendation AIs. If NVIDIA AI is the
OS, then NVIDIA pretrained models are the application suites.
Let me highlight one of the new pretrain AIs, Jarvis. Jarvis is an interactive
conversational AI. State-of-the-art deep learning model end-to-end, 100 milliseconds
blink of an eye response time. World-class results in speech recognition and
translation.
Jarvis supports 5 languages today, English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese and
Russian. Pretrain models are a company with some great tools and NVIDIA to
customize Jarvis to the language lingo of your domain, health care, technology,
insurance, retail, customer service of some kind.
And NVIDIA ﬂeet command to securely deploy and manage your AI to your ﬂeet of
EGX computers, end-to-end, top-to-bottom complete. And this is most important.
Jarvis and NVIDIA pretrained models runs in any cloud and now on-prem and to the
5G edge on NVIDIA EGX.
If you deploy to the 5G edge, and aerial A100 GPU. And with our ariel 5G VRAN
stack turns the EGX server into a 5G base station that runs AI services like the cloud.
We brought the power of the cloud to the edge.
I'm delighted to see the IT industry join us to bring EGX AI platform to the world's
industries. Dell, ATAS, HP, Vmware, Red Hat, Google Cloud, Splunk, Cloudera, Omni
side, Check Point, Fortinet. And in 5G, Ericsson, Maviner, Fujitsu and so many more I
didn't list.
I appreciate all of your support. We may have noticed -- you may have noticed that
the leading cybersecurity companies are also joining our platform. NVIDIA
Morpheus, real-time, all packet inspection platform is really exciting and really
essential in this future, 0 trust security model.
Autonomous driving is one of the first mass market robotics applications. It is also
one of the most intense machine learning applications that requires decade-only --
decade-long investment. NVIDIA strategy has 3 central pillars: first, build an end-to-
end and full stack drive service that we will operate with automakers.
Second, build an open platform for the drive building blocks for the entire
transportation industry to build AVs. And third, generalize the learnings from drive to
create other machine learning applications like robotics and edge AI.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 7 of 37On the left is the pipeline. It's an incredible thing that drive -- autonomous driving
requires. Hyperion 8 AV system in BBA test car collects data that are data factory
processes into label training data. Label data and Omniverse synthetically generated
data trains our models. Then drive AV application runs an Omniverse drive
simulation on real car computer, but in our data center, these computers are called
constellation.
And the software is OTA into the car with ﬂeet command and tested in BBA.
Effectively, a massive AI computer and a ﬂeet of AV computers that are running
continuously in a loop improving continuously.
This is the machine learning loop. All of this work will go into the 2024 Mercedes-
Benz EQS ﬂeet. On the right is our AV computer road map, the growth in computing
is staggering and needed. We announced Atlan, our car computer for the 2025
generation.
It's 1,000 tops in a chip and fuses our most advanced GPU and AI technologies, the
Bluefield 4 data center technologies. The most advanced arm server class CPUs,
years of functional safety and security expertise and tens of thousands of
engineering years of software.
All software developed on Xavier runs on Orin and then on Atlan. One architecture.
Our car computing platform that offers carmakers 1 consistent and programmable
installed base that they can leverage software investments across and a growing
installed base that they can deliver value to for the life of the car.
We announced Hyperion 8 a fully production able, functional, safe and secure car
computing platform, including sensor, network, computer and software for data
collection, testing and production.
Hyperion 8 is compatible with NVIDIA's entire AV stack. Hyperion 8 is a standard
reference AV car system that can fit into most vehicles. Hyperion 8 is like the PC ATX
motherboard, a standard reference that invigorated and accelerated the PC industry.
We announced more Orin customers. The transportation industry is quickly
becoming a technology industry. Makers now realize something very important. They
now realize that the car is more than the vehicle. But an installed base, an installed
base platform that they own. And if the computer is powerful, it will host value
software services they invent for years to come.
This is a giant new observation and is transforming the industry. A few million cars
installed based on the road -- a few million cars installed base on the road for 15 to
20 years, even a few hundred dollars of services each year represent an immense
value creation opportunity.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12

Page 8 of 37Jeffrey FisherPutting an Orin a few into the car is the best way to build a valuable installed base.
NVIDIA is an accelerated computing company and innovates across the entire stack.
NVIDIA is built as an open platform with 3 layers: chips and systems, software
platforms and application frameworks.
With the global NVIDIA partner network connected to the layers of our platform, we
serve customers and markets from the layer best for them. Each higher layer offers
an order of magnitude more opportunity for our company. Our chips and systems
market opportunity is profoundly greater with NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omnivere.
Our markets -- our company's market opportunity is profoundly greater by offering
drive as a service to a 10 trillion miles a year industry and Jarvis to automate
hundreds of billions of hours of spoken language each year. All of this is built on 1
architecture, each layer, leveraging and enhancing the layer below.
We had a great GTC and lots of new products, new partners and new markets. These
are the points that I highlight. Bluefield and Grace make NVIDIA chip company to do
data center scale computing. NVIDIA EGX is our new AI platform for enterprise and
industrial 5G edge.
And this NVIDIA AI enterprise is our new software product. Others are NVIDIA GPU.
NVIDIA Omniverse, base command and ﬂeet command. And I'm looking forward to
NVIDIA pretrained models like Drive and Jarvis going into production services.
NVIDIA is a computing platform company, innovating across 3 chips and a full stack
3 layers. Jeff Fisher will be up next to talk to you about gaming. So with that, I'll hand
it over to Jeff. Fish?

Thanks, Jensen. Welcome, everyone, to Analyst Day, 2021, excited to give you guys
an update on our gaming business.
Every person born today will be a gamer. That's 140 million more gamers this year
alone. As gaming has become a past time for millions more people, it is transformed
into one of the largest and fastest-growing forms of entertainment. Gaming is no
longer about playing a game.
Gaming is an immersive social network connecting like-minded people building
lifetime friendships. Discord which began with a mission that connect gamers has
grown into a social network and more than doubled its active users to 140 million in
2018 -- since 2018.
Gaming is a sport. Esports have fueled a new generation of e-athletes who compete
for bragging rights and has span professional careers. 75% of Gforce gamers play
esports. Esports inﬂuence is growing, and the world is tuning in.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 9 of 37In the past two years, the esports audience has grown by 75 million, totaling 436
million viewers. Gaming has offered -- gaming also offers interactive storytelling.
While watch a movie, when you could play a movie that's a cinematic and rich as
anything produced in Hollywood.
And gamers look to share their passion for gaming, live streaming their gameplay
and connecting content for others to watch. In 2020, a 100,000,000 hours of
gaming content was watched on YouTube. That's twice of 2018.
The growth of gaming is also evident on steam. One of the top destinations for
gamers, where 120 million people played every month in 2020. With 25 million peak
concurrent gamers that's up 1.5x from 2018. In that same time, the Epic Game store
has grown from its launch in December of 2018 to 160 million PC gamers.
Gamers are demanding much more from their hardware as well. So our GeForce
gaming platform continues to deliver more value. For example, this past year, we
launched DLSS 2.0. And DLSS uses AI to deliver a significant performance increase
in games. Running on RTX tensor cores, DLSS can increase frame rates by up to
100%. Press and gamers have widely recognized DLSS as a must-have feature for
gaming.
We also delivered a powerful weapon to Esports Gamers NVIDIA Reﬂex. System
latency is a killer literally for our competitive gamers. Shots need to be spot on, not a
few frames behind the opponent.
In the case of Blizzard's Overwatch, which recently integrated NVIDIA Reﬂex, reﬂects
reduces system latency by 50%. And now 8 of the top 10 competitive shooters have
integrated NVIDIA Reﬂex. And last, we brought AI to streamers and video content
creators with NVIDIA Broadcast. NVIDIA Broadcast can turn any room into a
broadcast studio, like my oﬃce here.
2020 was an exciting year for our gaming business. two years ago, we introduced a
breakthrough in graphics, real-time ray tracing, and AI-based DLSS. We called it RTX.
In 2020, we doubled down. We introduced the Ampere architecture. Ampere
featured a new Shader design a second-generation RT core for ray tracing and a
third-generation tensor core for AI.
It was our biggest generational leap ever. And gamers who are waiting to upgrade
to RTX jumped in. Combined with strong gaming market fundamentals, the
increasing production value of AAA games, global Esports growth and an increasing
number of creators and streamers, we delivered a record year. Our 5-year gaming
GPU CAGR is 21%, with growth in units shipped and ASP.
Looking forward, RTX represents a huge reset of the installed base. RTX was featured
in the biggest games of last year, including Cyberpunk and WatchDogs Legion and
in massive hit titles like Fortnite, World of Warcraft, and the best-selling game of all
time, Minecraft.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 10 of 37And if you haven't seen some of the beautiful RTX worlds that Minecraft gamers are
creating, do a quick Google search of RTX Minecraft.
Trust me, you will be amazed. With every major operating system, game engine and
console supporting ray tracing and a strong pipeline of games on the horizon, RTX is
the new standard.
Looking just at our installed base of 140 million GeForce gaming GPUs, 85% were
designed to run traditional games. Turn on rate tracing and like this example of the
hit game control, the games become unplayable on these GPUs. RTX with RT Cores
and AI-based DLSS delivers beautiful ray trace games at terrific performance and.
And the upgrade opportunity extends well beyond this. Considering the hundreds
of millions of gamers playing on a wide range of hardware, just look at steam for a
peak at this hardware profile. We believe RTX is at the front end of a major upgrade
cycle and we are off to a great start.
The excitement was really high prior to the Ampere launch. If you recall, rumors were
all over the Internet. Google Search for NVIDIA RTX was up 6x compared to that
around the turning launch. Since the RTX 3000 was pulled from last September,
sales have been off the charts.
With new buyers and those upgrading sales have outpaced prior generations by 2x.
These are end market sales. While demand continues to outstrip our supply, gamers
are getting their hands on Ampere. Amper share on steam is twice that of turnings at
the same time after launch.
More important, as the GeForce gaming platform continues to add more value to
gamers, gamers are buying up each generation. This chart on the right shows the
end market ASP of our desktop stack.
This was calculated for the six months after each architecture launch. In effect,
today's desktop card ASP is $360. That's based on MSRP. That's 20% higher than the
same time after turing launch.
And I believe there's plenty of ASP headroom, especially compared to what gamers
are paying for consoles, which start at $500. Now let's talk about the fastest-growing
game platform, gaming laptops.
This past January, at CES, we launched the RTX3000 series for laptops. With 70 new
models from every OEM starting at just $999. This was our best laptop launch ever.
Laptops represent a major growth opportunity. As new buyers are choosing laptops,
choosing gaming laptops to learn, play and create.
Fueling this growth is Max-Q. Max-Q is a system design approach that delivers high-
performance in thin and light gaming laptops. It has fundamentally changed howFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 11 of 37laptops are built.
Our third-generation Max-Q was introduced with the Ampere architecture. It
includes dynamic boost 2.0. For the first time, dynamic Boost uses AI to dynamically
shift power between the GPU, CPU and system memory, depending on where it is
needed most.
And most important, it shifts power away from where it isn't needed. Max-Q also
features resizable bar, which enables more eﬃcient memory access to boost
performance while using no more power and an updated whisper mode, which
maintains high system performance while minimizing acoustics.
Over twice the number of Max-Q models shipped this year -- or shipping this year.
2021 will offer the thinnest, highest performance gaming laptops ever. And I've got
mine right here. This has got an RTX3070, high-performance gaming laptop, thin
and light. This follows a strong -- this follows years of strong growth at over 20%
CAGR.
Gaming laptops are outpacing the consumer laptop market and out selling the most
popular game console. New students, gamers and creators are clearly choosing
gaming laptops for their next PC. And our gaming business is more than just playing.
The creation of digital content is exploding.
For the 45 million creators and growing, we launched NVIDIA Studio. NVIDIA Studio
is our accelerated platform for creators, speeding up ray tracing and AI in over 60
creative and design applications, including Adobe Photoshop, DaVinci Resolve and
Blender.
Studio includes monthly dedicated studio drivers that we release. They offer new
features, faster performance and enhanced stability for creative applications. Since
the launch of Studio in 2019, there have been over 100 purpose-built studio laptops
and desktops from every major OEM.
Our Ampere architecture takes NVIDIA Studio to the next level. Rendering is up to 5x
faster than pascal. Video editors can now use AI to simplify workﬂows.
Video incode times are reduced by up to 75%. RTX will change the way creators
work. We estimate there are over 30 million streamers globally. On Twitch alone, the
number of streamers more than doubled over the past year.
In China, streamers are becoming a new e-commerce channel, selling gaming
hardware direct to their followers, including GeForce RTX GPUs. Sharing your
gameplay while streaming requires high-performance hardware. Many enthusiasts
use 2 PCs, 1 to play and the other to broadcast.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 12 of 37NVIDIA broadcast paired with GeForce RTX solves that. Broadcast uses AI to
eliminate background noise and to green screen your background. And the
powerful video encoder in RTX is capable of streaming video without impacting your
gameplay.
NVIDIA Broadcast works seamlessly with all the popular streaming and video
conference apps, it turns any room into a broadcast studio, and all you need is an
RTX GPU.
VR has long been viewed as the next thing for gaming. With the availability of lighter,
more capable headsets like Quest 2 Valve's index and HP's River G2, along with
compelling new games, like Microsoft Flight SIM and VR and Valves half-life, Alex,
which drove a 71% increase in VR game sales on steam. VR is coming into its own.
It's reported that Facebook has over 10,000 people working on augmented and
virtual reality. And as you heard today, NVIDIA is building the omniverse. Our portal
in a VR portal into a metaverse.
VR headsets have twice the resolution of a desktop gaming monitor and demand
very high, smooth frame rates. It's very unforgiving from a performance perspective.
This requires a very high-performance GPU and provides more motivation for
gamers to upgrade.
There are expected to be over 30 million PC capable VR headsets sold in the next
five years. And from what you've heard today, that could be conservative. This past
year, we oﬃcially launched GeForce Now, 10 years in the making. GeForce Now
leverages our GeForce PC platform into a cloud gaming service.
Gamers on underpowered PCs, Chromebooks and mobile devices can effectively
subscribe to a virtual GeForce PC in the cloud. And the PC ecosystem is coming
along with us.
Gaming stores and publishers like Valve, Epic and Ubisoft, see the opportunity that
we see to reach billions more gamers, and we are not building it out alone. Our
strategy is to team up with ISPs and telcos or GFN Alliance partners around the
world to offer GeForce Now to their subscribers.
Alliance Partners manage the infrastructure. We operate the service, and we share
the revenue. This will become increasingly more powerful as 5G blankets the world.
With a high resolution, low latency requirements of gaming, cloud gaming is the
killer app for 5G.
Today, GFN has passed 10 million registered users. And offers 1,000 instantly
playable games with much more coming online every Thursday in our GFN
Thursdays, 2-minute and watch for that.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12

adding South America to the list for 2021, including our most requested country and
1 I'm most excited about Brazil. Brazil is traditionally a low end hardware gaming
market, and they are going to love GFN.
Brazil has 95 million gamers alone. Over time, I see GFN extending beyond gaming
to all kinds of interactive experiences. This past Sundance Film Festival, GFN hosted
Disney's interactive short AMAG streams as part of their new frontiers showcase.
To wrap up gaming, we see a long runway for growth. RTX resets everything and will
drive a major upgrade cycle. The entire PC ecosystem needs to upgrade, including
85% of our gaming installed base. As the value of our platform grows, gamers are
buying up.
Laptop continues to offer a strong growth opportunity. Gaming laptops are
outpacing the consumer laptop market. Max-Q makes laptops thinner and lighter
and new buyers are choosing gaming laptops.
RTX and RTX laptops will power the 100 million and growing number of e athletes,
creator streamers and virtual reality adopters. Last, GeForce Now continues to scale
up. The PC ecosystem is coming along with us. GeForce Now gives us the
opportunity to extend our PC platform to billions more gamers.
I want to thank you all for joining me and joining us on our Analyst Day. And with
that, let me hand it over to Colette Kress.

Good Morning, everybody. Fiscal year 2021 was a record-breaking year for NVIDIA.
We achieved record revenue and EPS, launched our Ampere Architecture for both
gaming and data center into incredible demand.
Completed the acquisition of Mellanox and announced our transformative
acquisition of Arm. Let's first look at some high-level highlights of our P&L. Our fiscal
year 2021 revenue increased 53% year-on-year to $16.7 billion, fueled primarily by
the tremendous ramp of the Ampere Architecture across our data center and
gaming platforms.
We grew our non-GAAP gross margins by 310 basis points as data center increased
as a percentage of revenue. We also demonstrated strong operating leverage. Our
non-GAAP operating income increased 82% year-on-year, and our non-GAAP EPS
increased 73% year-on-year to $10 a share.
Let's turn to the performance of our market platforms. Our gaming business grew
41% year-on-year to record $7.8 billion, in fiscal year '21, with broad based strength,
driven by growth in our desktop, notebook and console businesses.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 14 of 37We reinvented the graphics with the launch of our RTX 30 Series GPUs. And and the
demand has been off the charts, resulting in the fastest launch in the company's
history, twice as fast as Turing.
Gaming revenue has seen a 4-year compounded annual growth rate of 18%, driven
by a combination of GPU unit and blended ASP growth. Unit growth has been driven
by the expanding universe of gamers, our phenomenal success in growing gaming
laptops and strong demand in our console business.
Blended ASP growth has been driven by the gamers buying up the as they adopt
new features and capabilities like NVIDIA ray tracing and deal less us. As the
production value of games continues to increase.
Turning to pro visualization. Our revenue declined 13% in fiscal year '21 to $1.1 billion
as we believe enterprises deferred purchases due to the pandemic. Despite these
headwinds, we grew revenue at a 4-year compounded annual growth rate of 6% as
we benefited from the continued growth of a number of the GPU accelerated
applications.
And as RTX technology gains broad industry adoption. Automotive revenue
declined 23% year-on-year in fiscal 21 to $536 million due to lower global production
volumes and the expected decline in infotainment revenue. We grew revenue to a 4-
year compounded annual growth rate of 2% as strong growth in our autonomous
and AI cockpit solutions were largely offset by the declines in infotainment.
Autonomous solution and AI cockpit are approaching 2/3 of our automotive
revenue. And we expect mix to continue to shift to these businesses over time as
substantial wins in these areas ramp in the coming years.
Data center had a record year with revenue increasing 124% year-on-year to $6.7
billion, including almost 70% growth for data center compute. The A100 based on
our Ampere architecture delivers up to 20x performance increase versus the prior
generation, our largest generation we've ever.
It delivers high utility driven by its unified architecture, allowing you to process
number numerous workloads, including training, inference, data analytics and
graphics. MIG technology allows the A100 to eﬃciently scale up for demanding
training workloads and scale out for high-volume inference use cases.
These advances of the A100 combined with the forces of AI and cloud computing
drove strong demand in fiscal '21 across hyperscales and enterprise customers.
From a workload perspective, we saw strength across training and inference as
exponential increase in AI model complexity and compute requirements drove the
demand for NVIDIA accelerated compute and networking products.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12

Page 15 of 37Finally, Mellanox had an outstanding year with growth stemming from hyperscale
supercomputing and AI customers. From a product perspective, Mellanox saw
strength across Ethernet and infiniband offerings. In total, we have seen tremendous
growth in data set with a 4-year compounded annual growth rate of 69%.
AI is the most powerful technology force of our time, and we see a long runway of
growth ahead of us. As you know, NVIDIA is a full stack computing platform
company, spending across silicon, systems and software.
So far, our software has largely been offered as part of the platform and not directly
monetized on a stand-alone basis. Jensen earlier discussed our 3-layer model of
customer engagement, which conveys our go-to-market strategy as well as our
growing revenue opportunity as we move up the stack to offer software
commercially.
This helps unlock large new market opportunities and will add reoccurring revenue
to our P&L over time. Let me now highlight 1 such opportunity. We recently
announced NVIDIA AI enterprise, a comprehensive suite of enterprise-grade AI
software that speeds development and deployment of AI workloads and simplifies
management of enterprise's AI infrastructure.
Through our partnership with Vmware, hundreds of thousands of VSphere customers
will be able to purchase NVIDIA AI enterprise with the same familiar pricing model
that IT managers use to procure, VMware infrastructure software. NVIDIA AI
enterprise software is offered in a perpetual license per CPU socket with annual
maintenance.
We also offer the software suite as a subscription. We believe the NVIDIA AI
enterprise software suite represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity. NVIDIA AI
enterprise, combined with our EGX enterprise platform is democratizing AI and
helping to bring NVIDIA AI and accelerated computing to the world's largest
industries.
Our EGX platform is gaining rapid adoption as enterprise customers such as
Lockheed Martin and Mass General bring in. Additionally, we are supporting these
systems with powerful processor road map, as shown with the launch of our A30 and
A10 GPUs, our aerial A100 platform and our Bluefield DPU road map.
This powerful enterprise and edge computing platform positions NVIDIA for the next
wave of AI adoption and will be driven by the vertical industries. Let me shift gears to
our automotive opportunity. The NVIDIA drive platform is seeing wide adoption
across the transportation industry, which will create a significant software
component.
Today, vocal cars announced that it will build next-generation vehicles on NVIDIA
drive alone. This further extends our partnership with Volvo to now include more
software-defined vehicles in its lineup beginning in 2023.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 16 of 37Volvo joins other established OEMs, such as Mercedes, Audi and Hyundai, who were
all developing on investment (technical diﬃculty) driving including many trucking.
The auto we are harnessing the new season GPUs, but also their incredible energy
eﬃciency.
Last year, we announced a landmark partnership with Mercedes-Benz, which will
adopt NVIDIA's full stack drive platform to enable their entire ﬂeet of vehicles to
software-defined and perpetually upgradable.
This deal was transformational in that in addition to the hardware, it includes a
revenue share component for the software sales that Mercedes to make on their ﬂeet
of connected vehicles, such as AutoPart.
Vehicle owners will be able to purchase over-the-air software and service offerings to
enhance the capabilities of their vehicles and increase the joy of driving. With
software content potentially in thousands of dollars per vehicle, this could be a
multibillion revenue opportunity for both Mercedes and NVIDIA.
Not only is this deal transformational to NVIDIA's business model, but for the auto
industry is large. There are 100 million cars sold each year globally. And over time,
we believe all vehicles will be autonomous, software-defined and upgradable.
We see the potential of similar deals with other automakers. This large and growing
list of wins across the transportation industry is set to ramp in the coming years and
will drive a major inﬂection in our revenue.
We have over 8 billion in automotive design win pipeline through fiscal year 2027,
with a good amount of this revenue expected to ramp in the latter part of this time
frame.
I talked earlier about the revenue growth that our data center and gaming market
platforms experienced over the last few years. Over the past four years, our data
center business has grown nearly 3x the rate of the company's 25% compounded
annual growth rate. This mix shift has led to a favorable expansion of our gross
margins, as our fastest-growing business is also our highest margin business.
Given the secular forces of AI and cloud computing, combined with this rapid
adoption of our computing and networking platforms, we believe this trend can
persist.
Additionally, the gross margin profile of our gaming GPU business has increased
over time as gamers have bought up our stack, resulting in rising blended ASPs. We
expect this trend to continue over the coming years as gamers upgrade to Ampere
RTX continues in its rapid pace of adoption and the overall production value of
games continues to increase.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 17 of 37Overall, our gross margin has increased from 59.2% in fiscal year 2017 to 65.6% in
fiscal year '21. We continue to see uplift to our gross margin profile as our mix shifts
to higher-value platforms. Furthermore, software is a significant opportunity for
NVIDIA.
This revenue as it scales, will provide an additional tailwind to gross margins. As
discussed, our non-GAAP gross margins have increased 640 basis points over the
past four years, and our non-GAAP operating margins have also increased at even a
faster rate, growing from a 32.1% in fiscal year 2017 to 40.8% in fiscal year '21.
We delivered significant operating leverage, even as we invested heavily across the
market platforms to support the growth we have demonstrated over the years.
And as we look to take advantage of the material opportunities that lie ahead of us.
We have a single architecture across all of our platforms that forms the basis for our
product offerings and innovations.
Our 1 architecture approach provides us leverage and core IP to innovate across the
entire technology stack from silicon, systems and software, to compute, networking
and storage technologies. We are able to rapidly develop new products and
technologies, move quickly into new markets and nurture a large and growing
ecosystem of partners and developers innovating on our platform.
This, in turn, fosters increased adoption of our platform and helps to drive revenue
growth and our ability to invest. This ﬂywheel of innovation is accelerating, as seen
by our incredible breadth and depth of products and technology as found into many
new announcements discussed today.
NVIDIA's unique business model allows us to innovate like no other company while
driving attractive economic returns. Going forward, we believe we can continue to
drive strong revenue growth, while delivering earnings growth and healthy cash ﬂow
generation.
On revenue and earnings growth over the past years, it has also resulted in material
increase to our cash ﬂow generation with cash ﬂow from operations growing from
$1.7 billion in fiscal year 2017 to $5.8 billion in fiscal year 2021, a 37% compounded
annual growth rate.
This increase shows our ability to invest for growth. Our capital expenditures
increased from approximately $200 million in fiscal year 2017 to $1.1 billion in fiscal
year 2021.
It has also allowed us to engage in transformational M&A as seen with our purchase
of Mellanox and the announced acquisition of Arm. We maintain a disciplined capital
return possibly with $5 billion returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and
share repurchases since fiscal 2017.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 18 of 37We remain committed to paying a dividend. We employ a conservative financial
quality and have a healthy balance sheet with $11.6 billion in cash and marketable
securities and $7 billion in debt.
Overall, our business is highly cash generative, and we expect continued growth in
our cash ﬂow in the coming years. This will help fund our investments as we seek to
take advantage of the growth opportunities across our business.
We start our fiscal year with great momentum across our business, while fiscal Q1 is
not yet complete, our Q1 total revenue is tracking above for $5.3 billion outlook
provided during the fiscal Q4 earnings call.
We are experiencing broad-based strength with all of our market platforms, driving
upside to our initial outlook. Additionally, we now expect CMP revenue to be
approximately $150 million higher than the $50 million included in our fiscal Q1
outlook.
Upside to CMP is not displacing supply from our other platforms. It is incremental.
Within data center, we have good visibility, and we expect another strong year.
Industries have been increasingly using AI to improve their product and services. We
expect this will lead to consumption of our platforms through CSPs, resulting in more
purchases as we go through the year.
Our EGX platform has strong momentum, and we expect this will drive increased
revenue from enterprise and edge computing deployments in the second half of the
year. Overall, demand remains very strong and continues to exceed supply, while
our channel inventories remain quite leaning.
We expect demand to continue to exceed supply for much of this year. Our
operations team is agile and executing fantastic rate, and we expect our supply will
increase as the year progresses. We believe we have suﬃcient supply to support
sequential growth beyond Q1.
Finally, I want to discuss our commitment to ESG. NVIDIA is committed to build one
of the world's great companies through people, innovation and energy-eﬃcient
technology. This means not only doing what's good for business, but what's good for
our employees, our business partners, society at large and the environment.
We have been recognized as one of the best places to work by a number of
publications, including Forbes, Fortune and Glassdoor. No time better highlighted
our innovations in this past year when our technologies played an important role
fighting the pandemic across a wide range of use cases.
Our Clara platform helped with discovery efforts as community races to develop a
vaccine and other treatments. Our V100 and T4 GPUs help scientists create the first
atomic scale map of the corona '19 virus. And our AGX platform helped keep healthFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12

Finally, our RTX and virtual GPU technologies help the world work, learn and play
from home. We are also committed to investing in a safer environment. Our GPUs
inherent provide more energy-eﬃcient form of computing, up to 42x more eﬃcient
for processing AI workloads.
The green 500 list ranks the world's most energy-eﬃcient supercomputers in the
world. NVIDIA's own Supercomputer ranks #1, the most energy-eﬃcient
supercomputer in the world. And NVIDIA powers 26 of the most energy-eﬃcient
systems in the world.
Finally, we are committed to sourcing 65% of our total energy consumption from
renewable sources by fiscal year 2025. That wraps up our presentations for today. I
want to thank everyone for tuning in to our GTC and presentations, and we would
like to now move to Q&A for this portion of our event. So moving it back to you,
Simona.
Questions And Answers

Thank you, very much, Colette. We will now begin the Q&A portion of our event with
analysts who have joined us on Zoom. ( +++presentation Operator Instructions) Our
first question will come from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.

Yes. Congratulations on the solid DTC at Analyst Day. Jensen, just talk a little bit
about the Grace announcement and congratulations. I'm kind of curious how added
into the $100 billion data center TAM that you guys discussed a year ago, do you see
Grace?
And as part of your presentation, you reiterated your commitment to x86 and Arm
and actually mentioned multiple CPU players like Intel and, Marvell, Rabatin. How do
you see the co-opetition between your rechip strategy and Grace specifically and
the ecosystem that you still want to support?

Yes, I'll work backwards. The -- first of all, thanks for the question. We -- the world's
computing is really diverse. I mean there are so many segments of computing and
each one of them are architected slightly differently for good reasons.
Some of them are optimized for a single-threaded performance. Some of it is
optimized for many quarters. Some of it is optimized for strong IO performance,
some of it is really optimized for large amounts of data.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12

Q - Christopher Muse
A - Jen-Hsun HuangWe designed Grace for -- especially for a particular application that is a set of range
of applications, if you will, that is really dedicated towards giant data scale
computing. You're working on terabytes and terabytes of data for a very long period
of time.
And recommender systems are part of this. Natural language understanding models
are part of this in the future. You're going to see multi mobile transformer models
that are learning from from video and speech at the same time or images and
speech at the same time.
And these are going to be processing just a gigantic amount of data, health care,
processing a giant amount of data. And so we're really designing Grace for this
particular segment. For -- with respect to co-opetition, we worked very closely with
AMD. As you know, they're the CPU and our DGX. It's a fantastic CD.
We work with Intel and enterprise data centers, in notebooks. We build amazing
notebooks together. We work with Ampere computing in cloud and cloud gaming
and supercomputing, computing. Marvell at the edge MediaTek for PCs and mobile
devices.
And so the world of computing is gigantic and the nature of our company is an open
platform. We're a platform company. And we use the word platform probably more
than any chip company in the world. And we do so purposefully and exactly that this
is really about building a platform by which the entire ecosystem can benefit.
There is no sustainable growth that is not inclusive growth. There is no sustainable
growth that doesn't include partners and collaborators and developers and and
ecosystems and such. And so we're delighted to partner with all of these great
companies to build the future. So I appreciate that question. Thank you.

Our next question will come from C.J. Muse from Evicore.

I guess, Jensen, to follow-up on John's question. I was hoping you could speak a
little bit more around our CPU strategy. It looks like Grace into 2023 appears to be
high performance, high bandwidth using Nvlink. But said, as you look to 2025 Grace
next as well as potentially a couplet strategy. What is your ultimate aim here looking
over the next 5, 10 years?

Yes. Thanks, C.J. Well, first of all, Grace next, I'm going to have to save that that
surprise you. I hate to ruin your surprise, and there's so much stuff that we're working
on.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12

Q - Vivek Arya
A - Jen-Hsun HuangOur strategy as a company, our -- if you will, a core philosophy as a company, are
really to do things that are uniquely for NVIDIA to do and things that are really, really
hard to do. And I prefer things that take a long time to do. And things that, frankly,
nobody else in the world is doing.
In every aspect of the conversation that we had in the keynote today, you could see
that in everything, whether it's Omniverse or Grace or Bluefield 3 or DOCA in
everything, Morpheus, our new cybersecurity platform.
All of these things drive everything, Hyperion 8. The world doesn't have it. And that
really needs to be the driving purpose of companies to go solve problems that are
incredibly hard that are uniquely specialized for our capabilities and that the world
doesn't have.
And so it is the nature of our company to go build CPUs that the world doesn't have.
Build CPUs and build products that can somehow expand the envelope, expand the
overall size of the marketplace for everybody.
And so, so we're going to continue to work with a whole bunch of CPU partners and
many of that I've mentioned many, many more. That are building all kinds of different
specialized CPUs, and we'll build ours. And of course, support everybody else with
the NVIDIA AI platform, the NVIDIA platform, so that we can bring forward this new
method of computing, we pioneered call accelerated computing.
That is, if you will, the highest level bit and everything else is really about expanding
more, expanding reach in a way that other people can't.

Our next question will come from Vivek Arya from Bank of America.

I appreciate the very informative Analyst Day. Jensen, I'm curious to get your strategy
on the role that system and software and subscription sales will play at NVIDIA over
the next several years because we think of NVIDIA as more a semiconductor
company, and obviously, that's the key part of the business.
But then we also see you launch a number of system products, a number of them on
subscription-type services, whether it's in the data center or enterprise or gaming.
You're talking about subscription sales on the enterprise side and then the
automotive side.
I'm curious, what is the strategy here? How big are those businesses for you today?
how big can they be over time? And what impact will they have on the financials of
the company?
FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-04-12
NVIDIA Corp (NVDA US Equity)
Page 22 of 37Yes, Vivek, thanks for the question. The driving -- the driving purpose for the full
stack approach is to pioneer accelerated computing. When you create a new form of
computing that is brand new, and it doesn't come along very often. And if you take a
look at the modern way of doing computing, it's running on CPUs. And then, of
course, cloud computing came along.
Largely running on many CPUs, turning an entire data center into a computer. And
the approach that we pioneered is accelerated computing. Accelerated computing
is very different than accelerators. Our GPUs have video encoders inside, video
decoders inside.
Those are accelerators, image processors and accelerated computing as a general-
purpose computing platform that is somehow particularly good at a domain of work
and accelerated computing platform and a company who is a computing platform
company is sensible about architecture compliance, it's sensible about backwards
and forward compatibility. It's thoughtful about creating an installed base and
developing developers and ecosystems and networks and partners.
And so our primary goal is to pioneer accelerated computing. Well, before you
could do that, you really have to build a whole stack because the entire way of
computing is refactored. We refactored computing from the application to the
algorithms, to the solvers, to the system software, all the way down to the silicon, as
you guys know well.
And that's why we say NVIDIA is a full stack company. We're a computing company
that's a full stack company. Because in the final analysis, it's essential to pioneer a
new way of doing computing.
Now the way -- the thing that we select our approach, our strategy is to develop it in
3 layers, which is the 3 layers of computing. It's the hardware layer, the system
software layer, the middleware layer, if you will, operating systems are in that layer.
Vmware, for example, in that layer and maybe AI is in that layer, okay?
So those are algorithms and solvers and middleware that connects, if you will, the
application on top to the hardware on the bottom. And that transformation is very
specific to accelerated computing. Now transformation is very specific to NVIDIA
CUDA in our GPU architecture.
And so the third and the third layer, of course, is applications. In the world of AI, in
the world of AI, the invention we created underneath was DGX and tensor core
GPUs and such. In the middle is this layer called NVIDIA AI. And the upper layer
would not be an application, but it would be a skill, it'll be a task. A skill that could
perform a task.
That task could be driving cars. That task could be recognizing speech and
answering a question, a query. That task could be responding to a recommendation.
