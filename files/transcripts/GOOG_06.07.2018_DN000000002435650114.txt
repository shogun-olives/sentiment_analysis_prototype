A quick word about Bloomberg Intelligence. Bloomberg Intelligence provides in-
depth research and data on industries, companies, as well as government ESG credit
and litigation factors that can impact business decisions. We cover about 135 plus
industries, close to 1,800 plus companies, and we have about 300 plus third-party
data providers that we work with. And we also have about close to 300 people that
are part of our team and BI is exclusively provided to clients to subscribe to the
Bloomberg Terminal and can be accessed via BI GO.
With that, let me pass over the presentation to Stacy, who will take us and give us a
