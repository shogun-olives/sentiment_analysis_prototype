Thank you, Patrick and good afternoon, everyone. This is Sarah Meron, Head of
Communications for Tesla Motors. Welcome to the call with Elon Musk, Tesla's
Chairman, CEO and Chief Product Architect, for a question-and-answer session
regarding today's announcement. The press release for the announcement is
available at www.teslamotors.com\press and a webcast of this Q&A is available on
the Tesla website as well. Today's call is for your questions. But we would like to keepFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

conduct the Q&A session live. (Operator Instructions)
During the course of this call, we may discuss our business outlook and make
forward-looking statements. Such statements are predictions based on
management's current expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially
due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most
recent 10-K filed with the SEC. Such forward-looking statements represent our views
as of today and should not be relied upon after today. We also disclaim any
obligation to update these forward-looking statements. And now I will turn it over to
Elon.

Thank you. So I know a lot of people are wondering what today's announcement was
going to be about and it's -- a lot of people are thinking, well, is it that we are going
to announce something revolutionary about service or some huge expansion of
superchargers or maybe something else that is pretty amazing that is right under
your nose if you are driving a Model S. We will make those announcements. But not
today.
We are going to put out a new announcement probably every week or two from
here on out. But today's talk is really about financing. It is about trying to figure out
how we combine the best of ownership and leasing and we are really thinking like
there has got to be some better way than the traditional approach. And that is what
we are able to do working with Wells Fargo and US Bank was to come up with
something where essentially net of the tax credit, you can buy a Model S for no
money down net of the tax credit and around $500 a month. It can actually be less
than that depending upon what sort of tax deductions and what time savings you
gain. And I think that really makes it affordable to a much broader audience than
people currently think is the case.
I know that when we did this with SolarCity, when we transitioned from a purchase
model to a finance model, it had a tremendous effect on customer adoption and I
anticipate a similar effect with Tesla.
Then we wanted to address -- in addition to addressing this sort of question of
affordability, we also wanted to address the longer-term question of residual value or
peace of mind in buying an electric car. Because a lot of people think, well, what is
going to happen to an electric car? Is the battery going to depreciate much faster
than they expect? There is a lot of uncertainty.
So we wanted to eliminate that uncertainty. We felt the best way to eliminate that
uncertainty was to say, okay, we will match the residual value -- guarantee the
residual value of the Model S proportionate to that of a Mercedes S class, which is
made by our partner and investor, Daimler and that is an iconic car, it is one of the
most respected premium sedans in the world.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

Q - Damon Lavrinc
A - Elon MuskSo you see guaranteed to be on par in terms of residual value with one of the best
cars in the world. And not only is Tesla standing behind that. But I am personally
standing behind that to illustrate the level of confidence I have in the long-term
value of the Model S. So really the goal there is to give customers complete peace of
mind. Like you do not have to worry about buying a car. Then to match the
convenience of a lease, you can just give us the car back after three years and we will
take it and either trade it in for another Model S or give you cash.
So you have all the convenience of a lease. But all the value of ownership because,
unlike a lease, you are not obligated to give us back the car for that amount. You are
welcome to retain it. So the car has greater value in that, which I think will. You have
the option to hang on to it if you would like. And so it gives you the right to give it
back to us. But not the obligation.
We are really trying to figure what is the best possible thing that we could give, if we
were a customer out there, what is the thing that we would want. And that is what we
are trying to construct here. And there may be some continued refinements over
time as we try to make it even better. But I think we (inaudible) pretty great and I am
really excited about how people will respond to it. So with that, we can jump to the
questions.
Questions And Answers
Damon Lavrinc, Wired.
Thank you. I was hoping to get a rough estimate on what we are looking at as far as a
monthly payment is concerned? I realize that the partnership between the two banks
is going to consume some of that initial cost. What are we looking at as far as
monthly payments are concerned?

Yes. Absolutely. It is always important to look at net out-of-pocket. That is the thing
that really matters and this is where electric vehicles really shine because the cost of
electricity is maybe 10% to 20% that of gasoline per mile. So you actually -- if this was
your daily driver, that is where it really comes into play. The savings in gasoline per
month plus other factors like getting oil changes, smog checks, filters changed,
brake pads changed, on the Model S, for example, you never need to change the
brake pads because most of the braking is done regeneratively with the electric
motor.
There are actually huge savings that one experiences there and by having a monthly
payment, you actually really do see that difference. Whereas, if you acquire the car,
you still see that difference. But it is over a longer period of time. So effectively, yourFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

Q - Nichola Groomnet cost of ownership is maybe $500 or $600 a month and in fact, in some
circumstances, can be quite a bit less than that.
And I should mention we have a calculator on our website that you can then
customize as a consumer and say, okay, well this applies to me or this doesn't apply
to me and just basically adjust it to what your actual circumstances are and get a very
accurate number for what the net -- the true net out-of-pocket cost is per month for a
Model S. So we are trying to make it such that you can just -- you can just answer the
questions -- how do you -- how do you conduct your car ownership experience and
get a personalized number that applies to you.
Dana Hull, San Jose Mercury.

Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. What kind of credit score do you need to
qualify for this lease and can existing reservation holders convert their reservation to
the lease model?

The credit score information is something that is proprietary to the banks. There is --
you do need to be considered quite a good credit, I know, for the best terms. But we
see certainly a majority of our customers. And I think perhaps the super majority
qualifying for these loans. And unfortunately, this does not apply to prior purchases
of the car and because of the residual value guarantee, it only applies on a go-
forward basis. If we were to apply it retroactively, it would affect the accounting in
past quarters.
So this is planned on a go-forward basis. But I should mention that our expectation is
that the residual value is for all Model Ses is in excess of what we are guaranteeing.
So the guarantee is really just there to give people peace of mind. Our expectation is
that the value of the car will actually be in excess of that number, all cars.

Okay. Thanks.
Nichola Groom, Reuters.
Hi, thank you. I was wondering if you could just say why this was important to do?
You have always had a lengthy reservation list for your Model S and there seems to
be plenty of demand for it without this financing product. Why was this important to
do?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

Well I mean it is true. We do have plenty of demand for the car, even without a
finance product. But as much as possible, I would like to broaden the affordability of
the car. It has always been my goal from the beginning of the Company to try to
make -- mass-market cars. I wish we could've done a mass-market affordable car as
our first car. It simply wasn't possible because it is going to take at least three major
iterations of the technology to get there.
However, by providing a compelling financing solution for the Model S, we are
helping to broaden the access of customers to the car and I think that is a good
thing. So that is really our goal. We are really the business -- this announcement is
about improving affordability, about giving people peace of mind and about giving
people the whole convenience factor of just being able to give us back the car for a
known amount of money in the future. And I think it is the right thing to do and I do
expect that that demand will respond accordingly. We have quite a big factory. So
we have a lot of room to grow.
Joe White, Wall Street Journal.

Hi, just quickly. So this looks like the kind of product that most other car companies,
luxury car brands are already offering. And I am curious what happens when, if I
decide I want to keep the car, what do I do? I mean keep paying on it? What
happens?

Yes, I think you hit on a key differentiator, which is that if you want to keep -- with
what we are talking about here is you have the right to put the car back to Tesla at a
known price, which is the same percentage of residual value of a Mercedes S class.
But not the obligation. So like in contrast to a lease, if you want to buy the car at the
end of that lease, you have to pay that amount because you don't actually own the
car. But in our case, you can either get the preset amount, which is essentially --
which is equivalent to the residual value of the lease or you get to keep the car if it
has greater value and I think it will have greater value. So that is beneficial to the end
customer.

So if I make three years’ worth of lease payments, I can just keep the car?

Yes. Well you keep the car and I mean you continue paying -- it's not a lease per se. It
is a financing essentially over five years. So you would continue paying your
financing payments for the next couple years at which point you would have paid offFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

Q - Jim Motavalli
A - Elon Muskthe loan and you would fully own the car. That is essentially what would happen. But
like I said, you have the right at the three-year point to put the car back to us for a
known amount of money or to retain it, pay off the remaining amount and own the
car.

Okay, I don't want to overstate my time. But I just want to play that back to you. So
basically I am signing up for what amounts to a five-year loan. At year three, I can, if
for whatever reason I want to sell the car back to you, I can do that or I can just keep
paying?

That is correct. You are essentially building equity in the car and I mean it is a loan
that you can collapse at any point as well. So that gives you additional ﬂexibility. So
this is a loan where you could sell the car, pay off your remaining principal at any
given point in the five years and be done. You are not locked in like a lease.

Okay. All right, thanks.
Jim Motavalli, Car Talk.
Yes, Elon, you had mentioned at the beginning that this is somewhat based on the
SolarCity model and I believe you are Chairman of SolarCity run by your cousin. Is it
true that, in SolarCity, I believe you don't actually pay anything upfront for the lease
cost. If you could just talk a little bit about how that model, how successful it has
been and how that led to this model for Tesla. And also if you want to disclose your
net worth, (multiple speakers).

I'd like nothing better than disclosing my net worth. What we found at SolarCity was
really pretty interesting because, in a sense, essentially the product that a customer
received at the end of the day was the same. They got solar panels on the house for
a particular power output. However, when we approached them and said would you
like to buy this system, some of these are sort of fairly expensive, like might be
$50,000, $60,000, people would look at that and say, well, I don't know if I want to
make that investment or I don't have the cash handy and it was just a harder thing to
get them to buy off on.
And we tell them that, look, this has got a payback period of five years. So within five
years, you have paid it back and then it is going to keep generating electricity from
there onwards. And we compare that to having a CD at the bank where somebody is
earning like maybe 2% and this would be like having a CD that earned 20%FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

Q - Mikhail Sabatguaranteed by the utility. And yet still people would have -- they would be reluctant.
It was a diﬃcult thing to get them to fork out sort of $50,000 in that case and so we
changed the model to one where we take care of the financing and then it is a much
simpler approach. And we say, look, what is your utility bill and with no money down,
after the solar system is installed, your electricity bill -- your total cost of electricity
goes down every month. So essentially you get more money in your pocket every
month just by installing solar and you have the environmental benefits as well. And
that was vastly more appealing to people even though it was essentially the same
product at the end of the day.
So in that case, SolarCity worked with a number of banks, including US Bank, to
provide that to people in a very seamless way and the Company's growth took off in
a tremendous way. We increased sales several fold. So it was very positive.
I think going to the net worth question, well, I mean if you went to look at some of
the assessments that are out there by Forbes or Fortune or whatever, they are, I
suppose, not too far off. So there is certainly significant assets besides Tesla from
which I can cover the guarantee that I am making and that is what I mean when I say I
am putting my money where my mouth is to say that no matter what happens,
people should feel confident that the residual value of their car will remain what we
are committing to here. And I am essentially making myself personally liable for that
because I believe so strongly in the quality of the product and the long-term value of
the Model S.
Didn't Forbes say $11 billion?

If they did say $11 billion, they are being a bit too generous. I am not familiar with that
number. That sounds a bit high. Any last questions there?
No. I think that is it.

Okay. Thanks.

Sure. Well for our financing product, we are expecting a pretty high percentage. I
would say probably a majority of our customers will end up taking this approach.
That is what I would recommend as the way to go for customers and I am guessing
probably at least half, maybe more. Sorry, this is with respect to the US and we will
be trying to figure out something for Canada as well and then Europe and Asia as we
get to those markets.
Jacob Brown, Source Interlink Media.

I was just wondering what the interest rate for financing through Wells Fargo or US
Bank would be for a well-qualified customer?

It's just under 3%. So like 2.95% I think is what we are talking about.

All right. Thank you very much.
Julia Pyper, ClimateWire.
Hi there, thanks for the call. I wondered if you could say how many orders you have
on the books right now and if you can say anything about number of cancellations
you have had?

Well this call is really about the financing. But I can say, as I said before, we certainly
don't have a demand problem and we expect to sell about as many cars as we can
eﬃciently make.
Maybe on that, could you address sort of delaying the Model X and how you expect
to put out this volume of cars?

That is not for today's conference call.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

A quick question, you mentioned that you are personally standing behind this offer.
Is that some kind of a guarantee separate from your word? In other words, a financial
guarantee that if somebody says to you, listen, I am not happy after three years. I
know you have the guarantee in there in terms of the residual value being equal to
the S class. But is there something more behind that wording?

No. I mean I think -- I don't think I could express it more clearly, which is no matter
what happens to Tesla -- I mean obviously I think Tesla is going to have a very bright
future. But there are some people out there who I think are pessimistic for reasons I
don't entirely understand. And even in that circumstance, I will stand by the residual
value if Tesla cannot with all of the assets at my disposal.
Thank you.
Mark Rogowski, Forbes.
What is the residual value on an S class right now after three years?

Yes. According to the Automotive Leasing Guide, which is the sort of industry
authority on leasing residual values, it is currently 43% after three years.
Okay. And you mentioned a five-year loan. But --.

Just to be clear, if you take the -- at the risk of being overly precise -- essentially if
you take the trailing 12 months and average the trailing 12 months for a Mercedes
S550, in Automotive Leasing Guide, which is the industry standard guide, it is 43%.
Sorry to be overly -- that may be too much detail. But anyway.FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

Q - David BakerNo problem. Precision is good. And you mentioned a five-year lease. But the
example on the Web calculator uses a 66-month model. So that seems to be 5.5
years if we are being precise. So is that the actual loan term that we are sort of
working with or does it really depend on what you negotiate with the bank?

This particular offering is a 66-month offering. So however, you get to give us the car
back after 36 months. So it's essentially -- we are taking, like I said, the best elements
of a lease, which is the ability to just return a car after three years with no hassle and
(inaudible) financing and so it is a 5.5 year loan, after which you would have paid off
all the principal. However, at the three-year point, you can just say, hey, I want to get
a new Model S or I want to get a different car and you can just give us back the car
and be done with it.
And do you guys think that if the cars are worth more at that point, you would be
willing to pay more for them or are you not looking that far ahead yet? In other
words, let's say the car is worth 50% of the price paid. So it is worth $40,000 instead
of $30,000, will you help people capture that value or are they going to have to go
private party to do that?

We will. If the residual value is higher than that and we think it will, we will pay the
market rate.
Okay.

Yes. So it should be thought of as no less than.
Thank you.
David Baker, San Francisco Chronicle.

I wondered if you could just sort of walk us through the process from the very
beginning and use someone in California as an example in terms of the state and
federal incentives that are available here. I am a California customer, I am interestedFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

Q - Jacob Brown
A - Elon Muskin going with this model. Do I actually have to put any money down, how exactly
does this work?

Sure. And I encourage people to go and check it out on our website, which has gone
live and has sort of the calculator and sort of figure it all out. But essentially, in
California, you get, in addition to the $7,500 federal tax credit, there is a $2500 state
tax credit and several other states also have a state credit. So let's say you bought a
Model S, including options, that was $70,000 or something like that. Then you would
have the -- the tax credits in California would amount to -- state and federal would
amount to $10,000.
So you would have $3000 left over from the tax credits and then I'm not sure what
the exact monthly payment would be for a vehicle like that. But I think it would be
something in the sort of $500 or $600 a month range. It could actually be a fair bit
less than that depending upon how you value your time or how much gasoline you
use because we are talking about net out-of-pocket, which is I think really what
matters to consumers and so it works out I think really well. I mean you could
essentially own a Model S for no money down net of the tax credits and around
$500 or $600 a month in California.

You would still be putting money down though because the tax credits only come at
a particular time, right? I mean you still have to front the money, don't you?

Yes. It is -- there is some time delay, which can vary from three months to a year sort
of thing depending upon when you buy the car versus when tax time is. But actually I
think the California one is immediate. Sorry, the California one is immediate. The
federal one is at tax time.

Got it. Thanks.
Jacob Brown, Source Interlink Media.

I was just wondering what you meant by you were personally guaranteeing the value
of the car and basically -- yes, that was pretty much my big question. How are you
guaranteeing it? And how can you make that kind of promise?

Q - Jacob BrownYes. So essentially Tesla is sort of the first backstop on the guarantee. So Tesla is
essentially saying that the value will be proportionate to that of a really awesome car,
which is the Mercedes S class and then for those who still have any doubt remaining,
worst-case scenario, because I know there are some people out there who are still
quite pessimistic about the future of electric cars and Tesla, I mean I think that is
increasingly changing, at least with respect to Tesla, that perception. But nonetheless
to give people complete peace of mind, I am personally standing behind that
residual value. So even if Tesla isn't able to honor it, I will personally do so.

Okay. So you are willing to put your own money into it or your own investments into
it to guarantee that, for some odd reason, if electric our values tank in the next five
years that nobody is going to be on the hook about it?

Exactly.

Okay.

That is what I mean by putting my money where my mouth is. And obviously I feel
very confident about the future. In fact, I think residual values are going to be
excellent and what we have seen with the Tesla Roadster, which is our first product, is
that we have seen very good residual values. And so we do have some confidence
as a function of what we have seen there.

Okay. Then if the customer doesn't want to give the car back and for some odd
reason -- or if the value of the car completely inﬂates because everybody wants a
Model S, you are telling me that you don't have to give the car back for the 43% of
the residual value?

That is exactly right. And that is part of what I mean by combining the best elements
of financing and leasing or ownership and leasing is you, as the consumer, have the
right, you have the right but not the obligation to give the car back for a particular
amount. So it is your car and so it is a one-way thing that's in the favor of the
consumer and we are trying to construct essentially the most consumer-friendly
financing product in existence. That is our goal here and yes.

Okay. Then, I'm sorry, one last question, is there any way to find out how good your
credit has to be to get this kind of financing?FINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

I think the banks are sort of sensitive to these requirements. You have to have a good
credit rating. But what we have seen is a pretty substantial percentage, a super
majority of our customers that have applied have been approved. So I think most
people who apply will be approved for the best outcome and then in some cases,
they might say, okay, well, there needs to be a slightly higher down payment or
something like that and we are going to keep working with the banks to make them
increasingly accountable over time to increase the approval rating. But what we have
seen thus far, because we have been running this as kind of a -- sort of a -- I wouldn't
say a secret. But as sort of a quiet trial program. In our quiet sort of trial program, we
have seen a super majority of people accepted in the sort of (multiple speakers).

I'm sorry, if you're financing a car, you're probably not going to have quite the net
income that you would to be able to buy the car outright. So would -- I mean is this
going to bring a lower income buyer into Tesla?

Yes, I think this is going to fundamentally improve the affordability of the car and yes,
this is what we are trying to do is we are trying to make the car more broadly
affordable to people and we are going to keep working it to make it better and
better in that regard.

And I don't want to cut this off. But we are running out of time. So we are just going
to take one more question.
Matt DeBord, Southern California Public Radio.
Hi, Elon, let me keep it short. You guys aren't currently doing any of your own
financing, right? I should probably know this. But is that the case?

Yes. We do not have like a captive finance arm like the big car companies. So yes, we
don't have that.
Do you anticipate that in the future given you may have taken the first step toward
that by putting your considerable net worth behind this deal?

I think we could see something like that in the future. It won't be in the near term. But
it could be there in the long term. Right now, the cost of financing from the big
banks is incredibly competitive. So it is not something that we could I think match
with an internal system in the near term. But maybe in the long term.
And lastly, is there a reason why you don't understand the pessimism out there even
though it may be meager in nature?

Well I could probably hazard some guesses. I mean generally the nature of the
pessimism doesn't seem to be based on fundamentals. But more on the idea that
while there hasn't been a new car company startup that was successful since
Chrysler and that was 90 years ago. But generally when people come and do theFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2013-04-02

customers or drive our car, as soon as they appreciate the actual product and really
do the research on the fundamentals of the Company, then that seems to have quite

encourage people to do that as often as possible.
