Thank you, Chrissy. Good morning. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of
Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee Company. And joining me today is Starbucks
CFO Scott Maw. The purpose for today's call is to provide a high-level overview of
the upcoming impact to Starbucks financial statements following the acquisition of
Starbucks Japan to help you with your modeling. You will recall we announced the
acquisition on September 23. I'll make a few remarks and we'll then open the call to
your questions.
Scott MawWe recognize that the estimated financial impact of this acquisition on the China
Asia-Pacific, or CAP segment. And on our consolidated results is significant and that
it is a complex transaction from a modeling perspective.
To facilitate today's discussion, late yesterday, we posted a document that
summarizes the accounting treatment as we transition the accounting at Starbucks
Japan into Starbucks financials from a joint venture structure to full ownership in
fiscal 2015. It may be helpful for you to refer to that document during this call.
Since we just announced Fourth Quarter fiscal year-end 2014 earnings last Thursday
afternoon, this call will be solely focused on the Starbucks Japan impact and not on
the broader business. We anticipate this call will last no longer than 30 minutes.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks
and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these
statements and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements and
risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC, including our last annual report on
Form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking
statements or information. Please refer to our website at Investor.Starbucks.com to
find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referenced in today's call
with their corresponding GAAP measures.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Scott.

Thanks, JoAnn. Good morning everyone. I'm going to summarize brieﬂy certain
points we made on the Japan acquisition call in September and in last week's
earnings call. This is to ensure we all have the same starting point.
Before I get into the P&L impact and modeling discussion, let me reiterate the
significant growth opportunities that we see in Japan as a result of this acquisition.
Starbucks Japan has been a very important market to us for nearly 20 years. And we
have grown this market with the excellent support of our joint venture partner,
Sazaby. Starbucks Japan stores have some of the highest operating margins in our
global portfolio. Additionally, under full ownership, Starbucks Japan will have the
opportunity to leverage Starbucks existing infrastructure and expand to multiple
channels, including consumer packaged goods, or CPG, licensing and food service
as well as introduced concepts such as Teavana. The ready-to-drink market is a good
example of what lies ahead for Starbucks Japan as Japan has one of the largest and
most penetrated RTD markets in the world and Starbucks share in that market is a
fraction of what it is in the US.
Another example of opportunity is mobile, digital. And loyalty as Starbucks has yet
to fully leverage the capabilities and breadth of our social, digital. And loyalty assets
in this market. With its deep customer loyalty, Starbucks Japan has developed its
own approach to the space, catering to local preferences and Starbucks is very
excited to build on that.
Let me now move on to some of the transaction details. Starbucks and Sazaby
League each owned just under 40% of Starbucks Japan with the rest held by public
shareholders. The acquisition has been structured as a two-step tender offer and in
the first step, which was completed October 31, Sazaby tendered its entire ownership
to Starbucks for $511 million. Therefore, now with 79% ownership, Starbucks Japan
will be fully consolidated into Starbucks Corporation's financial statements effective
with our Q1 fiscal 2015 results for roughly eight weeks of this quarter with the
remaining time using the preacquisition JV accounting treatment. The second tender
offer will be complete in the first half of the year and the expected purchase price is
approximately $410 million. Until the remaining minority shareholders' interests are
acquired, their share of Starbucks Japan's earnings will be excluded from our
earnings per share calculations.
As we stated at the time of the acquisition announcement, the majority of the
funding for this transaction will come from our substantial existing offshore cash and
result in minimal additional leverage. We expect the transaction to be slightly
accretive to earnings in the first year when excluding the following amounts: a gain
on the acquisition for bringing our pre-existing ownership interest up to fair value,
which is estimated to be in the range of $325 million to $375 million; and
amortization a significant acquired intangible assets and transaction integration
expenses of approximately $95 million to $105 million. These are all pretax estimates
and we will firm up the final amounts related to the gain and the amortization of the
intangible assets in Q1. The gain on the acquisition will be tax-free and reduce our
annual tax rate by 4percentage points and it will be accounted for below the
operating income line on the consolidated P&L.
Transaction and integration expenses will be recorded in unallocated corporate G&A
expenses. The presentation of these items is shown in the middle column on the
summary document we posted to our website. The amortization of the intangible
assets will be reﬂected as part of the depreciation and amortization line on the CAP
P&L.
From a modeling perspective, it is important to note that, under the joint venture
structure that existed prior to the acquisition, royalties in product sales are part of
revenue and COGS. And 39.5% of Starbucks Japan's profit is reﬂected on the
income from equity investees line. These items are noted in the left-hand column on
the summary document.
Following the acquisition, the CAP segment margin is estimated to be in the high
teens on a GAAP basis. Under the JV structure, our share of Starbucks Japan's
earnings added to CAP operating income and royalties and product sales were the
only Japan related items reﬂected in CAP revenue, a small amount compared to the
over $1 billion in annual revenue from Japan store sales which we will expect to
recognize this year.
Operator
Q - Jeffrey Bernstein
A - Scott Maw
Q - Jeffrey BernsteinThe relatively small amount of royalties of product sales in combination with the
income from equity investees results in operating margin in the triple digits from
Starbucks Japan under the JV structure. Under the full ownership model, CAP
operating income as a % of CAP revenue will result in a lower but very healthy
operating margin percentage initially in the high teens but growing to the low 20%
range over time, including an approximately 2% to 3% unfavorable impact from the
amortization of the intangible assets.
As we stated on the earnings call, on a total Company basis, we expect Japan to add
6 to 7 points to revenue growth and operating margin on a GAAP basis will decrease
slightly in fiscal 2015. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect operating margin to be ﬂat to
up slightly. Again, this margin is impacted significantly by the change in ownership
and the amortization of acquired intangibles. And we expect to return to strong
margin growth in 2016.
Japan will be our second largest market in terms of retail revenues. And we are very
pleased with the profitability of the Japan stores, the economics of the market. And
the overall high IRR on the deal given a significant growth opportunities I
highlighted earlier.
With that, let me turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Operator?
Questions And Answers
(Operator Instructions) Jeffrey Bernstein, Barclays.

Great. Thank you very much. A couple of clarifications. The 1,000 units that are
currently I guess JV-ed in Japan, at this point in the First Quarter or Second Quarter
of fiscal 2015, we should just be backing those out of the licensed line into the
Company operated line. Is that just based on the ratio of the ownership structure in
terms of the two components of the tender? Is that how we should think about it
from a unit perspective?

Yes.

Got it. Then the income line, which is obviously the big driver, I think it's income from
equity investees, how much of that should we assume that's within the CAP income
line today is specific to Japan in terms of how we adjust for that? Is that the majority
to the entirety or how much should we think about in terms of backing that out
starting over the next quarter or so?

Q - Katherine Heng
A - Scott Maw
It's the majority. We haven't identified it specifically. Obviously, in the First Quarter,
you will get a pretty good idea of the size. But it's the majority of that line in CAP.

Got it. But otherwise, from a modeling perspective, I think you said it adds like $1
billion to revenue. The tax rate on a non-GAAP basis, I know you said 31% GAAP but
we should be assuming more like 35% to the overall non-GAAP P&L for Starbucks
Corporation?

Yes. It's 31% on a GAAP basis with 4 points of impact from the acquisition gain. So
that should give you the math to get to what's a non-GAAP tax rate.

And ultimately the accretion to the fiscal 2015 guidance, do you size up what that is
from an EPS growth or EPS contribution perspective?

Let me frame it a bit for you. So if you go back to the guidance we gave in the Third
Quarter, I guided EPS growth 15% to 20% but towards the lower end. In the
guidance last week, I moved that up to the middle end of the range. And so if you
do that rough math, Japan is going to add 1 to 2 points to EPS growth this year.

Got it, very helpful. Thank you.
Matt DiFrisco, Buckingham Research.
Katherine Heng in for Matt. I just want to ask what's the full revenue from Japan. And
what percentage of ﬂow-through that you guys -- that we should be expecting? Is it
in line with the degree of purchase per quarter? Then also I have a follow-up.

So Japan will add over $1 billion to consolidated and CAP revenues in fiscal 2015.
And that's 6 to 7 points of total revenue growth for the Company.
Then as far as ﬂow-through, I think what we have given guidance on is the operating
margin at the CAP level, which as you know is about 30% today. That will move into
the high teens for 2015 on a GAAP basis. That has 2 or 3 points of negative impact
Q - Katherine Heng
A - Scott Maw
Q - Katherine Heng
Operator
Q - Sara Senatorefrom the amortization. And so if you take that into account. And we know that will
grow over the next handful of years, what will happen to CAP on an adjusted basis is
we'll be approaching the margin of where the Americas is today.
So if you look at the Americas margin today and you look at what CAP will grow to
on a GAAP basis over the next few years. And you add back the 2 or 3 points from
the amortization of intangibles, you start to get into the rage of where the Americas
business is today. And obviously that's a great, big, highly profitable business. So the
CAP model and the CAP margin is a significant profit driver for us. And Japan is a
big part of that going forward.
Then what kind of breakdown of revenue is from stores and CPG? What's your goal
to grow CPG channel in Japan and what's -- I guess should we assume that the CPGs
in Japan have a higher margin than retail as it is in the US?

I think what I would say is, today, licensed store, food service and CPG combined in
Japan are relatively small. The CPG business is a nice business and it's a profitable
business and we have been growing that. But compared to the great big retail
business, it's a relatively small portion.
If you look at the growth opportunities that drove the deal and the cash ﬂows that
drive the return, we see significant opportunities in those channels to unlock those
growth opportunities given 100% ownership. So I think as we get into investor day
and as we get into more of the specifics of the Japan opportunity over the course of
the year and beyond, we can give more specifics on the size of the opportunity. But
that gives you some general understanding of where we sit today.
All right. Thank you.
Sara Senatore, Sanford Bernstein.

Thank you. Just trying to understand the unit economics a little bit here, about $1
billion for 1,000 stores. So am I thinking about it right, AUVs of $1 million? And that's
a little bit lower than what we see in the US or some of your best European markets.
So I guess I'm just trying to understand. Is there an opportunity there? Is that a
difference in ticket or transaction? Both?
Then the follow-up question is could you just talk about the complexion of the
margin changes? I know you have a cost of goods component related to when you
sell products to licensees. I always thought that was sort of lower margin. So if we are
A - Scott Maw
Q - Sara Senatore
A - Scott Maw
Q - Sara Senatorethinking about how the different line items on your cost structure change, I guess
how should we think about cost of sales versus store operating expenses versus
other? Thanks.

Okay. Thanks Sara. So on the first part, the thing that I would just highlight is we've
said over $1 billion. So we expect at least $1 billion of accretion from Japan and
realize that we'll have a portion of the year that's under the old ownership model. So
that's over $1 billion doesn't reﬂect all the retail revenues for 2015. So when you take
all of that into consideration, the AUVs in Japan are actually quite close to what we
are seeing in the US. So we see really strong transactions. We see really strong ticket
in Japan. It is a very good AUV and highly profitable model for us.
I think maybe some of the math is giving us a little bit of wiggle room on the exact
growth in the Japan market. So it will be $1 billion or more. And the fact that we're
not getting the full annualization has impacted some of the math you're doing on the
AUVs but they approach pretty closely to where the US business is.
As far as the margin, I'll take a shot at answering it. And you can let me know how
close I get. So again, on an operating margin standpoint, both from a topline and an
overall profitability standpoint, the Japan stores stack up quite well with all of our
large markets across the globe. And so a lot of the economics and the drivers that
you see in Japan look, at least on a total store operating basis, very similar to the US
model.
Some of what's happening in the math year-over-year. And I'm not sure if this is
where your question is, is just that the revenue that we do pick up in the JV model is
just that product sales revenue. And so, if you will, the numerator of the margin
calculation is quite low. And the denominator. So it's much less than 40% of the
income. But we are picking up 40% of the income. So you have a -- the accounting
picks up a smaller percentage of the revenue but 40% of the income and the math
gets skewed. It doesn't really reﬂect I would argue the economics.
The other thing that happens is that royalty line, if you will, that's in that revenue is
basically all margin. That ﬂow-through on that is quite high, whereas the product
sales has COGS against it.

Understood, thank you.

Does that kind of get it?

Yes. I guess just the one point of clarification of you confirm product sales has GOGS
against it. Does that tend to be lower margin than what I would expect to see at
A - Scott Maw
Q - Sara Senatore
Operator
Q - Andrew Charles

Q - Nicole Miller
A - Scott Mawretail. So your food costs -- your COGS as a percentage to revenues when you sell
products to your licensees is higher than when I look at your retail business or your
restaurant, the cafes?

I think the overall math for everything we do in a country in a Company-operated
store and the margin on that versus just the product sales, that product sale margin
is a little bit lower.

Okay. Thank you.
Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

This is Andrew Charles filling in for Joe. You answered most of my questions with the
last question just about the economics as well as the margin ﬂow-through. So thank
you.

Thanks Andrew.
Nicole Miller, Piper Jaffray.

Thank you. Good morning. Obviously, nothing changes from the way you account
for these stores from a same-store sales or comp perspective. But can you just walk
through how the Japan comps are. And then how it looks from a price mix traﬃc
standpoint currently. And then where you see opportunity? Is it more traﬃc
weighted? Is it more mix shift weighted? Is it more price weighted in the future?
Thanks.

First, with the performance of the Japan market, over the last three years, they have
averaged 4 points of comp in Japan. And we haven't split that. But it's been quite
healthy comp growth given a pretty uncertain and pretty diﬃcult market
environment. I think if you look at our performance stacked up with others in our
space in Japan, that 4% over the last three years is actually quite strong. I think we
see opportunities to continue that. We'll obviously be looking at ways to grow that.
But I think we are really happy with what we have seen in the Japan market from a
comp standpoint and perhaps there are things we can do to accelerate that a bit.
Q - Nicole Miller
Operator
Q - John Ivankoe
A - Scott Maw
Q - John IvankoeJust on the way the technical way, if you will, of how comps work in Japan, just so
we're all clear, today, -- or sorry -- under the JV method that comps were not
included in any of our comp reporting. So we just report comps on our Company-
owned stores. Starting in the First Quarter of 2016, those stores will be comp store
sales. So the first year, the way the accounting works is they are not in the comp store
base. So the definition of comp stores is they have to be owned and open for a year.
So the first year, they will not be in the comp store base. I'm sure we will be giving
either directional or specific color on how those stores are doing in our earnings call,
just given the significance to the market. But just so we're all clear, CAP comps and
Company comps in the FY 2015 timeframe won't include Japan and they will going
forward.

Thank you.
John Ivankoe, JPMorgan.

Thank you. I'm going to ask a really basic question. And I'm sorry if I've just missed
the point here. Have you guided to a China Asia-Pacific operating income in dollars
in 2015, or as a percentage change versus 2014? Obviously, there's a lot of moving
pieces in terms of timing. Japan is not the only market in the overall segment.
There's currency that has changed, especially related to the yen. I think we've kind of
talked about a lot of different pieces. But at least I haven't heard in terms of like what
that actual operating income dollar number or % change number is for 2015, if you
could help eliminate that.

We haven't. But maybe I can shine a couple lights on it for you. The first thing I would
say is if you look at our guidance that we gave last quarter with 15% to 20% EPS
growth, towards the lower end of that. And the 1 to 2 points coming from the Japan
acquisition. And so if you wanted to get an idea, however you were modeling CAP
operating margin dollars before, you can get a pretty good understanding with that
range what the change is from Japan. So I think if you go and do that math, take your
existing model and add that 1 to 2 points of EPS growth, you'll be in the ballpark.
We have not guided to specific dollars by operating segment for some obvious
reasons. But I think that if you look at the margin guidance we have given, plus that
increment from Japan, plus what you already know about the business before the
Japan acquisition, you should be able to get pretty close.

Okay. That's fine. Thank you.

Q - David Palmer
A - Scott Maw
Q - David PalmerDavid Palmer, RBC.

Good morning, guys. Scott, just a question for you, a philosophical one about
guidance. Just thinking about the earnings growth that you've had in the last couple
of years and the guidance that you have for this year, excluding coffee, the growth
was 22% in fiscal 2013. And in 2014 about 14%. And this year about 15% excluding
coffee in Japan.
So the question might be -- and people are wondering if Starbucks is really settling
into a growth rate that is really midteens, or philosophically do you think Starbucks is
taking these boosts from coffee last year and Japan this year and essentially using
that room to reinvest to make the middle and higher end of the guidance possible,
or still possible, in fiscal 2016 and beyond? Thanks.

Thanks David. I think the first thing I would say is if you look at the 2014 growth rate
on a non-GAAP EPS, it was north of 20%. I think it was 21%. And if you take that
growth rate percentage and you back out the 4 points that we got from
commodities, that puts you right in the middle of our range. And so we did deliver
above the range this year. But coffee was a piece of that. And so we start with
roughly neutral commodities this year, we're pretty confident in that. And you add a
little bit perhaps around the middle of the range for Japan. And then you look at
some of the investments that I called out.
In the First Quarter, I called out specifically marketing and a leadership conference
that we had. But if you look at the whole year, I really pointed to some significant and
important long-term investments that have a little bit of impact of that growth rate.
We are not talking about a big impact. But they are investments that we think are
right so that we can perpetuate where we are and where we could be both within
the range and perhaps beyond.
And so when I look at things like mobile order and pay, there are some upfront costs
to that. We think that's a big deal for us. When we look at things like partner
investments. And Troy talked about Food for Partners and some of the things that we
are doing on paid, we know the partner experience in our stores and Starbucks is
the key differentiator for what we do. And so it's really important that, from time to
time and ongoing, we lean in on those investments. So when you add those things
together, coffee favorability going away, partner investments, that's what really
moves us down into the middle of the range. And I would argue, given all of that and
the size and everything that we have going on, I think that's really actually quite
strong EPS and operating income performance.

Q - John GlassReally helpful. Thanks Scott.
John Glass, Morgan Stanley.

Thanks. Scott, just going back to the equity income line, last year in CAP was $164
million. Either could you tell us either one of two things? One is what exactly of
Japan was in that line historically, or what was Japan's net income net of taxes or
whatever the thing you're measuring. And then we can take 39.5% of that.

Yes. We haven't really broken that line down. As you can imagine, we could get into
a situation where we're disclosing all of our JV income pick-ups. And just given how
some of the movements can happen in that as we go through time, that is something
that's diﬃcult to guide to. So Japan was a large piece of that. I think I said the
majority before, I think it's the largest piece but not the majority. And so I think, if you
think about that. And, again, you understand that that ultimately is going to go to
zero, you'll get a good read of the size of it year-over-year as we get into the First
Quarter. I think that's about all we can say.

But if I were --

There's just a lot of things -- go ahead.

But Japan publicly reported that number, right? So if we just took their net income
and took 39.5% of it, with that be the right way to do it, or is there some adjustment
you make as you take out your royalties or something like that or --?

There's adjustments we make, both from an accounting standpoint and also
understand that it's on a completely different GAAP basis. Japan GAAP and US
GAAP have some significant differences. So you're going to get a number that's
different than what's in our financials.

Okay. That's helpful. Can you just also remind us what's the unit growth in 2015 plan
or what was it in 2014 in Japan? Are there any significant CapEx needs in that
market? Do stores need to be upgraded to the current formats? Is there an IT
upgrade cycle that needs to happen? Is it material?

Q - Jonathan Komp
So in 2014, I think we added in the neighborhood of 50 stores in Japan. You can see
probably the exact number on the website. We haven't really talked about the
growth rate for next year. I think probably starting with something in that ballpark is a
good place. But we will get more specific as we go further.
What I would say is whatever we expect to open in Japan is in the CAP guidance that
I gave around store openings last week. And there's some IT work to do. What I
would say is it's not a significant amount integration work in general that we need to
do. The integration costs that are in the guidance I gave are not a major portion of
that. And the team there is operating extremely effective. We know them; they know
us. Mostly it's business as usual. But there is a little bit of integration work that we will
do just around making sure systems are aligned, we can get the numbers reported
and all that. But not significant.

Thank you.
Jonathan Komp, Baird.

(technical diﬃculty). Apologies for that. If I could just ask one more question, Scott,
going back to the recent operating performance at Japan. And really I just ask in the
context of the diﬃcult macro environment and then also just looking at the equity
investee line in the Fourth Quarter for the CAP segment, that number was only up
about 1% year-over-year. So could you maybe just reconcile and provide a little more
context on the recent performance for the business?

Yes. So if you look at the comp numbers of the overall profitability over the course of
the year in that JV line, I think the results are quite strong. What I would say, even
looking at the guidance that I gave, is the emphasis I would place on how the math
brings the margin down. I think it's highlighted by the fact -- and I said this in the
earnings call -- but if you look at the Japan market margin. So just the market level
margin, sort of ignoring the JV and all the accounting, that margin will actually
expand in 2015 at the market level. So we continue to see really strong core
profitability, really strong revenue growth. And also, in the Fourth Quarter of 2015.
And I mentioned this at a macro level in the earnings call, we did have an adjustment
for the asset retirement obligation on certain of our retail leases that went through
and favorably impacted that JV line in the Fourth Quarter of 2013. And so that's
affecting the compare. And it's a meaningful effect on that compare that you are
doing.
