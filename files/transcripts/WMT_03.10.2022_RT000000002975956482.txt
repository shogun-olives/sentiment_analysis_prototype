Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Michael Michael Lasser, the hardline, broadline, and
food retail analyst from UBS. How thrilling is this, we get to have a fun conversation
with Brett Biggs, Walmart's CFO. He's been the CFO since --

I don't think I've ever been called thrilling, ever.

This is thrilling.

Okay.
Questions And Answers

(Question And Answer)
This is thrilling. And part -- one of the more thrilling elements of this is across our
country, we've had two be big retirement announcements from superstars this year,
Tom Brady and Brett Biggs. And only one of them has actually paid their respects to
Boston. So, That speaks.

You've been working on that one a long time.Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs

Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
Yeah. I did. I think it hit though. So, that's good. And we have Kary Brunner with us as
well, a key member of our Investor Relations team. But thank you so much.

Yeah. My pleasure. This was the last live conference we did before COVID.

I know. I know. Last in first out as you have to say. And we appreciate you coming
back. One of the big topics over the last couple of days has been inﬂation, and
there's probably no company that has a better perch or better positioned to help the
consumer navigate through this inﬂationary environment. So, if inﬂation lasts longer
than expected, is that good or not so good for Walmart?

As you look at the last couple of years and go back the last five years, I think, we've
demonstrated the ability to operate pretty well in most any kind of environment and
consumer was really healthy, certainly partially because of the stimulus last couple of
years, but we performed really well in that environment as well.
I think as customers -- we're not seeing a lot of change in customer behavior at this
point. If we did and customers start getting more focused on their own spending, I
think we have a lot of things to offer for that customer. We have sharp pricing, we
have assortment, one-stop shopping with a Supercenter if you want to shop online
and stores, delivery, curbside, whatever you want, we've got it.
I don't think anybody benefits from a lot of uncertainty and we all probably have a
little more certainty than we would like to see right now in the macro-environment.
But when customers get really, really focused, I think we do incredibly well in those
environments.

Brett, do you think the perimeter of the heightened sensitivity from this in that, his
mom has started to ask him about some of these --

The mom and dad.

Mom and dad. So, what -- and does that say anything about how this is going to
unfold? We're all trying to figure out not just what's going to happen tomorrow, but
what's going to happen in the next six months as consumer has to navigate through
this?A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
You know, the consumers navigated a lot in the last two years. So, I think companies
and consumers have gotten a lot more ﬂexible in how they manage through
whatever situation they're in. So, I think the nimbleness is there. But I think, again
Walmart is in the right position to be able to help them through that.
We know -- we talked about it at the end of Q4, we know that inﬂation is on the
customers' minds for sure, still is, and now fuel prices. We've seen fuel prices this
high before, but probably haven't seen them go up this quickly. Maybe in most of
our lifetimes, the kind of speed we're seeing fuel prices go up now. Oil prices come
back down in the last couple of days. I think it's TBD what happens. But it's -- look,
consumers have a lot of things on their minds right now and I think we can help
them in that situation.

So, the year ago or so Walmart introduced an algorithm with generating 4% top-line
growth and better than 4% operating income growth. Excluding divestitures this year
it expects to largely be on trend with that and that's despite lapping an incredible
amount of stimulus that was distributed in the year ago period. So, if Walmart can
achieve that type of algorithm in this very dynamic and challenging environment,
why couldn't it do better than that in a more normal year?

You always like asking that question.

That's right.

I feel as good about the business as I've ever felt in our ability to achieve that
algorithm. We said (Technical Diﬃculty) top-line growth and the more on operating
income side. If you look at the last two years in the U.S. you take (Technical Diﬃculty)
$65 billion, 70% top line growth has amazing growth.
So, I feel great about our ability to do that, to be able to add on top of that.
(Technical Diﬃculty) If you add on the newer businesses that are growing businesses,
whether that's advertising marketplace, Walmart Fulfillment services, FinTech,
Healthcare, all of these are businesses that could scale on their own. They're all
scalable and they all tie in really well with what we're doing on what's called the core
retail side and that's really what the omnichannel strategy is.
And we get questioned all the time, so, look, how are you going to beat so and so?
Well, I'm not trying to beat someone. I'm trying to be the best Walmart. And by
doing that, I think, we will be the winner in retail over the longer term because of all
these different things that we can do that allow us to address customer needs, at theQ - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lassersame time to address shareholder needs and you want us to grow our returns. And
that's we feel strongly, we can do both.

And we talked a little bit about this earlier today. In the -- like literally in the coming
two weeks, this will start to be a period where not only Walmart but really the
economy lapse what was just an extraordinary amount of money that was distributed
to the consumer in the year ago period. How do you keep the team focused as
they're going to go through a period of declines in the business because the
business did so well in the year ago period it's only natural for human behavior to
panic.

Yeah. I mean, we still think we'll grow revenue in the quarter. But it's -- the reason our
operators and stores are so successful is that they do look at this day to day and
they're trying to -- they're competitive and they want to beat those numbers every
day. I think it's for all of us to step back and make sure -- we want a little bit of that
pressure, that's good. We want them trying to beat those numbers, but at the same
time, we got to step back and John Furner and Doug and others do this and all the
way down to the organization to say, hey, last year was, it was pretty different. I mean
March and April were huge sales volumes last year, particularly in the general
merchandise side. And we just we've just got to help keep people focused. We just
had our year beginning meeting last week about the Sam's Club and Walmart, which
was great. We got people back live and enthusiasm is fantastic. But we'll be smart
about it.

And would you, outside of Walmart, would you expect other retailers to start to
engage and need your reactions to the -- to what's inevitably going to be a more
diﬃcult environment?

I think you'd have to prepare for anything you might see. We've been through
periods of time, I think about in my 22 years of the company, we've been through
periods of time where the competitive environment gets more challenging or
discounting gets more heavy. I think this is more unlikely when prices in general are
going up. You may see less of that. But competitively, again, where we are with our
price gaps? Where we are on assortment? Where we are on customer convenience?
Just I think we've got a really nice mix. And I would say optionality and running the
business on we just -- you've heard me say this many times, we have so many levers
that we can pull as a company to make sure we're taking care of customers that need
us. And they need us more given what's going on right now, but take care of
shareholders. And as a management team, we know we have to do both. We don't
get to choose between those two.
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael LasserYou and I have actually talked about these levers repeatedly in these two seats over
the years. And it seems like the number of levers that are available to Walmart today
versus even just a couple of years ago has dramatically increased. And one of those
levers is Walmart connected to the advertising business and Walmart has aspirations
to be a top 10 advertising destination. Does it have the infrastructure to be able to
do that today? And just as importantly, does it have the credibility with advertisers to
be able to fulfill those aspirations?

Yes. I think we've always had the credibility. We have the infrastructure as well some
of the things we've done with our partnership with TradeDesk and other things like
that. More -- it's more automated, more self-service than we've had in the past. The
credibility is always been there in that space.
We've been a little soft limiting on this the past few years. If you go back to
conversations we had about this a few years ago, internally, we always wanted to
make sure that as we were growing the advertising business, that we could do it in a
way, that's not confusing for customers, that the site is not cluttered, that we're not
making it diﬃcult for customers. And also doing it in a way that when a product gets
recommended that the customer knows we think that's good for them, that it wasn't
necessarily someone else making that decision for us, that we still own how that
happens.
And we've gotten comfortable that we can do that and still grow a sizeable
advertising business. And I think there are some people as little larger than they
anticipated, but I think you can sit back and look at and say, there's definitely room
to go in that business. And you tell me the number of levers increasing, what I'm
excited about is that they have increased, particularly with some of the newer
businesses that we have, but it's not like I'm talking about 100 levers. It's a
manageable number of levers that are all scalable that we can focus. When I look at
all these newer businesses, each one of them can scale on their own. Some are
going to be better than we think, some -- just the likelihood all of them won't be as
good as we think. But if a fair number of them are as good or better than we think,
it's very sizable.

Yeah.

And so, it doesn't all have to work perfectly. But they're all great businesses and if
they work like we think they can, it's really exciting for the future.

And speaking of good businesses, you've gotten (inaudible) this morning when you
talked about financial services. It seems like that's an area of particular excitement.
How does Walmart build credibility in financial services? There's been periods in the
past where retailers have thought about trying to enter this arena and you'll seeA - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggsyours indeed a winner. How is this time different and how does Walmart build
credibility in this area?

We've had a long-term business in this. It's been what I'd call a little more quite older
school financial services, money transfer, money cards; the things that our customers
still need, want and we do a great business there.
We made the decision last year to partner with Ribbit Capital and some of you guys
may know Mickey and fantastic entrepreneur, great mind; and then Omar who came
from Goldman Sachs, again just fantastic, smart, innovative. And it gives us a chance
to look at the business a little differently and be a little more forward footed on it.
Today, one of the challenges that a lot of fintech businesses have is customer
acquisition cost. But given the eyeballs that we have and the number of people who
transact with us every week, customer acquisition cost is actually something we
already bring to the table. We should have lower customer acquisition costs than
other companies like that.
And when I think about financial services, I think about it and Doug and others do
too it's broader. It's how do you help customers solve problems. They're not sitting
there thinking -- and sometimes they're sitting there thinking I need a money card.
Sometimes you're sitting there thinking really just how am I going to make my life
easier? How do I manage subscriptions? How do I manage my budget? Where do I
invest? How do I go procure insurance? And it's all these things you deal with every
day and they're -- all our customers already and if we can just help that existing
customer base make their lives easier and it's profitable as well, it's a no-brainer for a
business like us. But I -- the way we'll do financial services in the future and not the
long future, in the near future is going to look different than what we did in the past.

Well, hopefully, you're not thinking about investment banking and equity research as
part of financial services. If you are, we should talk.

No, I'm not even going to touch that.

Okay. I'll pivot the conversation to the online business. And where I want to start is
Walmart has been building more infrastructure to support the various way it is
serving the omnichannel customer. And do you expect that Walmart will have to
have as large a last-mile delivery infrastructure as the largest online competitor out
there?
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett BiggsI don't think we have to, but I think we could. And we've started spark, (inaudible)
several years ago, four, five years ago maybe. It was another way for us to serve as a
customer who were using third parties, who were using the common carriers, doing
all kinds of different things. But it was something we wanted to try. We felt there
could be some benefit to us there and it's been great. It's been great enough that we
decided it could be its own business with things like Go Local that we could take
something that was a cost and turn it into a revenue stream and there's demand
there.
We're one of the largest business companies in the world. We know how to do this.
And so taking something like that and doing something as revenue-driving, it's
pretty different for Walmart, but it's how we're thinking about things now. And you're
going to see that I think more often in the future.
So I think, we could be, we can scale as much as we want to and we'll be ﬂexible on
how we look at that last mile. We want to get to the customer as cheaply as we can,
on time, the right service, and how we get that done then becomes the option.

So, is the thought process is, you can see all this as fast as both your 1P and 3P
business necessities?

Yes. We've got the infrastructure, the technology to really scale at how we want.

And to what degree does the technology and the infrastructure enable the growth of
the third party business? That's -- it seems like that --

Yes. Similar. Yeah. It's basically some of the same systems. So, it does allow for that
scaling.

And have third-party sellers seen this growth in various options that you've been
giving to them, and said that, well, Walmart's now more of a credible outlet for me to
grow my business?

I think sellers look at us a lot differently than they did three or four years ago as
we've made one -- we made onboarding much easier. We added 20,000 sellers last
year. We expect to add 40 this year. We've made it simpler, everything you want,
right? You make it simpler, you make it easier for them to build their business and
you give an alternative. We have a big e-commerce business, it's getting bigger. AndQ - Michael Lasser
A - Dan Bartlett
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggsso, they want eyeballs and they want simplicity. And I think, in both cases, we've
upped our game significantly in the last few years.

Is it as easy for a third-party seller to sell on Walmart as it is for them to sell on
Amazon?

I think for the most part we -- particularly now with Walmart Fulfillment services, that
is something -- it was a piece we were missing a few years ago. And as we add
capital in the fulfillment space, the good thing about the capital in that fulfillment
space is whether we grow third-party, first-party, it can all go through the same
fulfillment centers.
So, we're somewhat ambivalent to it except we want a bigger marketplace business.
Marketplace from a margin perspective, as well as a top-of-mind customer SKU
perspective, customer destination perspective is really important. So, as you think
about Walmart, you need to know that, when you go online you find anything you
want. We have 170 million SKUs today. I'm going to guess that's going to fulfill pretty
much everything you want, but we're going to keep adding to that. And it's all of
those things that matter.

I think --

We'll have a bigger marketplace business.

You will.

Yes, for sure.

I think the term that rhymes with neigh will is one of the most overused terms in the
business world right now. But it does seem like you're creating this ecosystem that
really is going to build on itself. And one of the drivers of this ecosystem is this
subscription model that Walmart introduced a few years ago, Walmart+. What is the
profile of a customer that signs up for Walmart+?

Yes. It's a big initiative for us. We -- people are talking about sometimes this is new to
us, but we've had Sam's Club, we've had a membership business for a long, longQ - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggstime. And so, we know what kind of things drive those businesses. It's an incredible
opportunity for us. We know that shoppers, I'm not going to get into the specifics,
but shoppers that have Walmart+ buy significantly -- I mean significantly more than --

If you get into specifics, what they're going to do, come on.

We'll just keep it at this. How about that?

Okay.

But significantly more than non-plus members.

Okay.

Our -- people that are members. So -- and we know that carries on. So, it's not just
they do it right away and then they don't use it again. Once we get them in, we keep
them in. There are significantly larger custom for -- customers for us, which is what
you would assume, right? And then when you get them into that ecosystem and
they're transacting, you're going to more the use of financial services and buy more
general merchandise. They're buying those higher-margin apparel and home items.
That's where the magic works inside that ﬂywheel and where the where the P&L
works as well.

So, we've talked about financial services, we talked about the third-party
marketplace, we talked about Walmart Connect, we talked about Walmart+. These is
-- these are the pillars of this evolution to Walmart's business model, what Walmart's
business model historically has been. You have big stores, you sell a lot of stuff, get
big volumes, use that leverage with your suppliers to offer the cheapest prices out
there. You still have that and then now you layer on all these alternative profits.
What's the strategy for then going to take some of those alternative profits in this
really juicy profit pool to then go and potentially reinvest back further in price and
distinguish Walmart even further from the competition?

We're always going to sharpen price. I don't think those decisions aren't mutually
exclusive. As we think about what the P&L looks like, we think about the algorithm
that we laid out, it's really about the total. What's the total profitability of theQ - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggscompany based on the revenue we think we can generate. And then how do you
move the pieces in a way that gets that done. There's all kinds of different ways to
get to the same answer.
So, it's not we make more money here and then just we're going to put that all back
into pricing. Our price caps are in really good shape and we're always going to be
there for our customers, but we're going to be there for our shareholders too. And
so, we're going to make sound decisions about how we think about pricing. There
may be times where we say, hey, we're going to -- more of that's going to ﬂow to the
bottom line, and there may be times where we say it's time to go invest in
something. And we do that, but it's another lever, it's optionality that we really
weren't talking about as much a couple years ago. But when I look out, I've said
before, right now, I feel as good about Walmart as I've ever felt. It's because of all
these different ways that we can get to the answer that we want to and serving
customers and taking care of shareholders. It's as good a position as we've been in.

And as part of the answer, look, we have this profit pool, but we don't want to get
too risky[ph], because it doesn't make sense to necessarily have our price gaps too
wide because it may not provide the unit response right now. But with that being
said, what gave you confidence to guide to how you did, was -- if you're not seeing
the traﬃc or the unit volumes, you have the optionality to make some of these
investments to be able to drive the business as you move throughout the year?

Growing market share for us is incredibly important. We want to be top of mind with
customers, but we can do that in a way that makes sense financially. I think we've
been doing that in a way that makes sense financially. But we want to take market
share. We've been taking market share. Top of mind with customers is number one
for us.

In these pricing investments and being top of mind with consumers could be that
much more important in this environment, where that lower-income is -- lower-
income consumers feeling a little bit of pressure. Are you seeing any signs that
consumer is feeling the pinch and how would you see it?

We're not -- we haven't seen much change in customer shopping behavior yet.
Typically, when fuel prices go up, you'll -- for us, you'll see some consolidation in
trends. You'll see traﬃc might go down a little bit, transaction dollars will go up.
So, the buyer bigger baskets that's fits right with us. If you're going to go, if you're
going decide to go one place versus three, you're going to Walmart because of the
SKUs, everything that we can offer you a product service. So -- but we haven't seen a
big change yet. And I -- when you look at all the metrics, you look at unemployment
is low, wage rates are high, customer balance sheets are still pretty good, savingsQ - Michael Lasser
A - Dan Bartlett
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasserrates are still pretty good. There's a lot of things that still feel pretty good from a
consumer standpoint and we just haven't seen that change as of yet.

Understood. Wages and labor investments have been a big topic for Walmart. There
was, I think, a round of investments over the last couple of years. Where does
Walmart stand in terms of what the average wage rate doesn't need to make another
investment, has it gotten any easier to attract routine employees?

Yes. I think the things we've done our last few years got us in good position and
probably no better metric than that then we hired a couple 100,000 people as we
got into the holidays, which is no small feat no matter how big you are.
So, I think that's a good data point. We have been proactive over the last couple
years not just in wage rates, but all the things we've done with live better you and
another benefits. So, the average hourly rate in Walmart stores today that's sort of
Walmart U.S. businesses is $16.40 little bit over $16.40 on average. Sam's a little bit
higher than that and supply chains over $20 an hour.
So, I think we're in pretty good shape. And again, the ability to hire is your best
metric with that. And we're all going to monitor and watch what happens in the next
few months with the inﬂation in wage rates and everything else, but as of right now, I
feel good about where we're at.

And how does the deployment of automation and technology help to alleviate some
of this? Walmart starting last year had made some investments in areas like micro
fulfillment. What should the market expect from those investments?

Yeah. We've made investments in places where we can be more productive, but also
in places where the jobs that associates scantily just don't like to do as much whether
that's one of the things that people really don't like doing is unloading a truck. It's
really diﬃcult to do, it's time consuming, it's labor-intensive. And some of the work
that we're doing, we talked about symbiotic in our distribution centers, it's going to
help alleviate some of that. You can redeploy people to jobs they'd rather do, higher
value. And so all that plays into, I think, what we want to do as a company. Not just
from a financial standpoint, but also what our associates want to do as well. But it
helps, I mean, it's we've gotten -- we're more productive than we were few years ago.

Is the deployment of those investments going to be bigger this year than they were
last year between the robots, the automated unloading?A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
Yes, there's some things we've been working on the last couple of years, primarily in
the supply chain that you'll see -- there's some store automation, but more on the
supply chain side that you'll start seeing us roll out over the next few years. And as
we go through that, we'll be walking investors through that and what we're doing,
where we're seeing the benefits, what we're working on.
And I think you saw us talk more about advertising in Q4. As we make -- our CapEx is
a little higher than its been in the past. And as we raise CapEx, we know that we
need to come back to investors and say, hey, here's what you're getting for that
CapEx. Here's what's working and here's what we're working on. And so, I think
you'll continue to see more and more data from us.

Has it been more challenging to deploy some of this automation than there was
sale? Because the recent narrative has been more about some of the alternative
profits and less about some of the --

Yes. Now, it's I -- we're pretty much where I thought we would be. The challenge is
two fronts. One the omni model has never really been built. There's no other
company doing what we're doing with stores and e-commerce and pulling this all
together in the way that we're doing. It's never been done. There's no playbook for
this.
So, we're developing the playbook. So it's hard enough we're on time or not. We
always feel like we're behind, which is probably what you want to hear, and we feel
that way. On the technology side, it's complicated. It's when you look at what we're
doing in our distribution sisters -- systems to automatically stack a pallet and stack it
in a way that you can unload at the store, save a significant amount of time the store
have it already when you get to the store. That's a complicated system, but we know
it works. And now we know that we'll be in the process of starting to roll out things
like that because it works. But it takes time. We're just doing things that haven't been
done before.

Yeah.

But it will also be I think a significant competitive advantage.

Has Walmart accelerated its embrace of technology versus a couple of years ago,
such that five years from now it'll be in a pole position or leading the deployment of
the next generation of technology?A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Yeah. It's -- we're incredibly comfortable with it. And a lot of that started with Doug.

Yeah.

Doug, and go back 30 years ago or 35 years ago, it started with David Glass. David
was really the first retailer that said we're going to put in satellite dishes and tuck our
scores every day. I feel like we're on another journey on that. And Doug's been a
leader in that. Three years ago, we brought in Suresh Kumar, who had worked at big,
big tech companies and he's brought in new ways of doing things and different ways
of looking at talent, different ways of looking at process. And yeah, it does feel
different than three or four years ago. It's faster, it's quicker. I feel like when things,
we go into something that doesn't work, I think we stop it quicker as well. So, I like
the feel of it.

Yes. I want to pivot the conversation to Sam's for a little bit. Sam's been doing --

Really well.

Really well. And with that being said, does -- is the room for Sam's to accelerate the
growth in new warehouses and others other initiatives now that it is doing -- has such
good momentum behind it?

I think there's always the possibility you could do a club here, a club there, but the
club base we have right now is strong. It's where we're getting more dense in each
one of those clubs. And the club business is about scale. And when you can get
scale in a club, it just runs differently. It runs much more smoothly and members like
it better, profitability gets higher. You throw fewer things away, it all just works better.
So, I like the club base that we have. Where we're seeing the biggest impact is
membership is up significantly, both base membership, but also our plus member
penetration is much higher. Member engagement is high. Sam's has been great and
leading the company at times in technology. And let's try something here at Sam's, it
works. Scan & go would be a great example.
You see that used more -- it's different at Walmart, but utilized at Walmart as well. It's
been a great place to develop people, and it's never run better. It started four, five
years ago really took a tick up. Furner was over there, Kath come in, done a great job.Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett BiggsThe team is -- you want to talk about a motivated team, that team is on fire. And we
talked about this little business, it's $70 billion or more. And so, it's really big
business and it's great returns for Walmart.

And there's a lot of talk about fee increases. It constantly asks for Costco, Netﬂix and
Amazon have raised their fees. Sam's hasn't raised its fees in a while. Why is it the
case and how much pricing power does it have to raise its fees?

Yes. We're always looking at member value and it's -- you look at the membership
fees along with pricing, the gross margins, your expense structures and what's best
for the member. I'm comfortable with where we're at today, but we're always looking
at structurally how does -- what does that look like. We've talked about a number of
times during my tenure. And so nothing to say specifically today --

No announcements?

No announcements today. Apologize I'm not going to do that on the stage here. So,
we're always looking at what the best I think the amalgamation of all those things are
for the member.

And pivoting to the international business, is the international business at all being
impacted by the geopolitical uncertainty? And how would you -- if it will be, where
and how will you expect it to be impacted?

Yes. We don't have any direct business in that region and a very limited even
supplier base in that region. It's -- I mean just on a human level, it's awful. And we've
got, we have associates who certainly have family members there and support them.
It's just -- it's an awful situation. Everybody thinks about and my prayers all the time
that situation. But from a business perspective, it hasn't had a major impact on what
we're doing. We reduced our exposure in the UK that would have been the closest
thing we had from a geographic standpoint. And so, it's just not from a business
standpoint and direct line of sight and also from a business impact.

Is the same point. And any -- will lead into a broader question. Any sourcing from
Europe that would be impacted?

A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael LasserI think it's just -- it's to be seen what happens. I think it's really hard to predict what
could happen. And I think just like everybody else, we're just going to have to see
this play out and be nimble about it. I think the last couple of years have proven how
nimble all of us can be with new things that seemingly kind of come out of nowhere
and we'll have to just -- this one's far worse, but we'll just, from a human perspective,
we have to work our way through it.

No doubt about it. Speaking of sourcing from a supply chain perspective, is the
global supply chain better today than it was six months ago?

Yes, I think it's definitely getting there. One, I think companies have learned to work
through it a little bit better. We're better in some ways because of that. And we've
just learned how to -- we can operate differently, we can do some different things. It's
not ideal. You'd like -- you don't want to go through what we've seen the last year.
But I think port congestion is getting a little bit better. Let's talk about at least maybe
like a couple of weeks ago everything seemed to be getting a little bit better.
When we gave guidance we had assumed that we'll see it settle out some probably
as we got toward the back half of the year and get in stocks back in like where we
would have them pre-pandemic. So, I think that's still our hope, but you always plan
for if it doesn't work out that way, then how we're going to keep working through.
And the good thing is we've learned to work through it.

And you mention between the supply chain challenges in (inaudible) before that.
Walmart has learned some new agility to --

Walmart merchant does a pretty tough job actually.

Yeah. Pretty well. Welcome to equity research.

Again, I'm not touching that.

Okay. How does this permanently change Walmart's agility? Does it make it -- does it
manifest to make it more profitable business because you've said, look some of the
things we had worried about doing in the past, we've had no choice to. And as a
result, we can now comfortably navigate that way?A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
Yeah. We have more confidence for sure that we can navigate, again, three years
ago, we started with tariffs, and then we went into COVID, and now we're in inﬂation.
So, we've learned to navigate through that. I think our merchants are better. More
tools in the shed to deal with situations like this. And we have a great mix of
merchants of -- our Chief Merchant, Charles Redfield. I have grown up in the
company with Charles and he's spectacular. And the kind of guy you definitely want
the see when you're trying to manage margin and pull all these levers. He's seen
probably everything you see as Sam's Club adds to Walmart. And then you have
some newer Merchants that can bring new ideas and bring fresh ways of thinking of
things and I think it's a great mix.

Yes. And speaking of profitability in the fourth quarter that Walmart International
business did experiencing gross margin pressure because the e-commerce business
was doing pretty well. Is this a structural challenge that not only the Walmart
business in -- the Walmart International business is going to have to navigate
through? Would the domestic business might have to experience this at some point,
or you've kind of mastered that?

The international business, you got a couple of things going on. You've got, as you
said e-commerce penetration is going up 20%-ish as we got toward the end of last
year. China business, which is big business for us. The Sam's business is doing
incredibly well, that's a good thing, but it's lower gross margins. Operating margins
would be somewhat equivalent. So, from an operating dollar standpoint, I don't think
you have a challenge there. Each market is really different and the Walmart U.S.
business still you have typically more general merchandise. So, you have a different
margin mix in the Walmart U.S. business and now with the other profit pools that we
have there, it's -- I don't think it's apples-to-apples.

In the profit pools that Walmart's developing in the U.S. how fast can it replicate
those--

Yes, we're starting to. It's in places like Canada, you'll see the -- look, Canada has a
lot of similarities to the U.S. and how we run the business. Walmex though is doing
an incredible job thinking of the strategy of what makes sense for the population in
Mexico and Central America. Walmex is a phenomenal business, great sales growth,
great profitability, great returns, just a phenomenal business. India is going to be a
business that we can continue to scale. I feel good about the markets that we're in
today.

Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett BiggsAnd in the converse of taking what's working in the U.S. scaling it internationally,
what's working internationally that you can now bring to the U.S.?

We've done in the past in a lot of the grocery business and pick up business, we
were doing that in places like Asda before we were doing in the U.S. And so, there
are certainly learnings and people as well. A lot of people that have come from Asda
to run some of our business. So, I like that. One of the first trips I ever took to Flipkart
would have been four years ago, and PhonePe, I started seeing some of the things
they were doing around, let's call it the broader definition of financial services. How
do I make the customers' life easier? And I came back to Doug, I was like, a lot of
these things we've been thinking about they're already doing it. They're doing it in
India and they know how to scale it. And we've taken some learnings from India and
how some of the things that we'll think about with our own joint venture.

And the growth in India, it seems to be pretty unlimited given the market
opportunity there. Are there key unlocks that still need to be put in place in order to
capitalize on this potential growth?

We've built out fulfillment capacity. It's always one, how do you get last-mile delivery,
but with what they do with E-Kart and some other things we've done there. I feel
good about our ability to get product to the customer. The huge market as far as not
just number of people, but the growing middle class. It's competitive, but we have
competition in other parts of the world. And when you have a market growing like
that, you're going to get competitors. And I think competitors make us better, it will
make us better there, but I think the growth there is still it's just TBD. It's -- it can be
big.

Pivoting the conversation, ESG has taken on a new relevance and new priority across
the business world. How is this -- what was I just asking?

ESG.

ESG. How is this impacting Walmart? It's -- at the very least, it's been much more
front and center in the market in the messaging to external constituents. But how is
Walmart practicing what it's preaching?

Yes, I think for us it's an advantage we have been -- this definition of ESG, we've
been -- it's been a part of our DNA for a long time and definitely back to 2005 whenQ - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasserwe --Scott introduced sustainability and we were the first ones who even knew what
it was and how we were going to make our operation more sustainable. And we've
gone from most of our store waste going to landfill that now I think over 80%
doesn't go to a landfill. We've got over 30% of our energy globally is renewable.
We've come a long way.
So, when this started coming up in the last couple of years, everybody like, hey
people going to talk more about ESG. We're like that's great. We've been wanting to
talk about it. We're a leader in this space. And the scale that we have, no one can do
what we can do to -- and it's not about, I want to make you happy from an ESG
disclosure perspective. It's what we can do for the planet and what we can do for our
customers and what we can do for society. We've been way out ahead of this and it's
one of the things I'm most proud about with Walmart.

Is this something that's increasingly been part of the internal discussion? And ---

It always has been. I mean -- and particularly again, since 2005, when we started
sustainability, it's almost every discussion I can remember around merchandising or
customer or strategy always had this element to it. And it's been a great part of the
business. We've saved our suppliers money, we saved ourselves money, we saved
our customers money. It is good business practice.

No doubt. Savvy or maybe happily depending on how you look at it. This is going to
be one of your last times in front of a forum like this, all these lovely folks. What skill
or trait do you think is important for your successor to have that you may not have?

That's like what's your greatest weakness question in interview. I'm hoping I haven't
left too much low-hanging fruit. It's a great question though and it's the right
question. And if you're Walmart or any company like this, you've got to be looking
ahead five to ten years and saying, what's the strategy? What do we need to be great
at? And for us, it's an omnichannel business. It's increasingly digital. Those are things
you are going to look at and say who's the best person to help us to work with the
rest of the team to guide us through that? I think it's always -- it's who's different.
When Tom Show was CFO 12 years ago, Charles Holly was different than Tom Show.
I'm different than Charles Holly, and the next person will be different for me. And
that's what you need. And I'm -- I was kidding with Doug, I said, inherently you're
looking for someone better than me. I understand that because that's what he
should be doing.

That's not easy to do.A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
But that's what a company should be doing. It should be looking to get better and
making sure that they take care of the future.

Yeah. And throughout this conversation and prior to this, you've mentioned several
times that you feel Walmart is never been in a better position. the better position
than it is in today. What makes you say that?

Yes, I get questions when I say that like, why are you leaving? Why are you leaving?
It's -- the company is in such great shape. And one, when you think about a
transition, this is when you do a transition. You do it when the company is in great
shape and the next person that comes in can work into it. That's what you want.
I've just I've never seen a time and I've gone back through. I'm actually doing, we
have an off-site another month and I'm going back through -- I'm one of the old guys
at Walmart now, so I'm going back through some of the history of the company and
explaining it to how we got to where we got to people that are newer to the
company.
And as I'm going back through that you see these inﬂection points like, when we
started the supercenters, not everybody thought that was the greatest thing we'd
ever done and it turned out to be the greatest retail format in the history of the
world. But I sit back now and I think -- we think we're in that moment again, you
really see it when you're in it. But I think we're in it, which is we've got a great base
business, incredibly good globally.
And then we have all these other places where we can touch customers lives without
going too far outside the retail circle, but touch their lives, fulfill our mission of
(inaudible) something a little better. Fulfill the mission, do in a way that makes sense
for our culture, do it profitably and help grow the business. And it's not just one
thing, it's not like here's the one thing we got to do it. And if it works, it's great, but if
it doesn't, that's not good. There's all different kinds of ways that we can make it
work and I feel like there's more opportunity now than I've ever seen.

And is Walmart's culture --

Revenue growth, profit growth, opportunities for associates to grow their careers,
ESG, I think all of those things, there is just more opportunity than I've ever seen.
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael Lasser
A - Brett Biggs
Q - Michael LasserIs Walmart's culture at the point where it will enable some of these opportunities?

Yes, I love the culture. It's -- there's so many things about it that feel like 22 years ago
when I came in, we were still very cost-conscious. And when I think about our four
core beliefs, they're all still the same. It's a very respectful place, but we're
competitive. We want to win, but I think we do it in the right way.
I've been blessed to be in this company and to be in this job, I don't lose sleep at
night because of the kind of company we are. I know we're going to -- we don't
always do things the right way because you can't be perfect, but we try. We really try
to do things the right way. And I've been blessed by that. But the culture has evolved
though in a way that it's more relevant I think for people who are coming in new to
the company, and more tech-focused. It's quicker. It's more agile. I'm still -- I'm not
surprised, but I'm still amazed how quickly we can move the size company we are.
So, all the good parts of the Walmart culture are still there, but it keeps evolving in a
way. I think Doug has done an amazing job in evolving the culture in the last seven
years, eight years that --

Yeah.

That wouldn't bet against us.

Well, congratulations, and we wish you much luck in your next phase.

Thank you, everyone.

So, please join me in thanking Brett Biggs.
