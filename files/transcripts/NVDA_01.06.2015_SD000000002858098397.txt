So on Sunday night at our press conference we announced our next mobile
supercomputer chip, the Tegra X1, which is the fastest supercomputer in the mobile
space with double the performance of our last chip, which we announced about a
year ago at CES, which was our Tegra K1. So it is very high-performance, really
moving some of the key deep learning ability computer vision and the super
graphics that we have with our Maxwell architecture right now for overall gaming
into an overall mobile chip associated with those processors.
Secondly, we announced two different modules for the automotive space. We
announced the overall Tegra Drive CX, which is a module for the overall digital
cockpit, next-generation. But can be really looked at as a plug-and-play to help in
the digital display as well as the overall infotainment system for the next-generation
cars. This is a key piece of using some of the key features in the graphics that again
you have with the Maxwell architecture, key shading, key ability to render materials
that you have in the car exactly into those digital displays.
The second piece that we discussed was our overall Drive PX. And our Drive PX is
our automated driving overall module. And that is really helping us in the deepUnidentified Participant

Unidentified Participantlearning and the computer vision for the future inside of cars, the ability for it to
detect 12 different cameras around your car and being able to recognize all different
types of objects, not just recognize objects such as that is a pedestrian, or that is a
car but really being able to differentiate between the different types of cars that are
out on the road, the different types of pedestrians, the different types of signs.
So what we are doing is taking the needed learning that we have with the overall
CUDA platform, the overall software that is necessary to start to teach the car to
recognize everything that is around it for the future and the ability to have a self-
driving overall car. So those were the key announcements that we announced at CES
at our press release on Sunday night.
Great. I think what was surprising relative to prior CES events is that like for example
the TK1 announcement last year was, here is the processor, here is the performance,
here is the different applications, gaming and embedded and automotive. And this
year with the rollout of an Tegra X1, which is what twice the performance of TK1 and
twice the eﬃciency, almost all of the focus was centered around automotive.
So is NVIDIA -- and then you know you had Drive CX and Drive PX and so the entire
event was focused around automotive. So is there a strategy shift at NVIDIA as it
relates to Tegra and the focus now more towards automotive and maybe solely
focused on automotive on a go-forward basis? Or is gaming, portable gaming and
other embedded segments of the market going to continue to be a part of your
market for the Tegra platform?

Absolutely. We are still using the best of technology from the graphics in types of
embedded types of devices that you will both need the deep learning, the ability to
have the computer vision but also being able to find any type of device that needs
that key graphics.
And overall mobile gaming is definitely an industry that we will continue to focus on.
So taking our understanding of the platform that we know so well for gaming on a
PC and moving that to all different types of mobile devices. So it's really a best of
both worlds. Those embedded devices for computer vision, deep learning but also
the ability to show the best display and graphics that people are becoming
accustomed to on no matter what type of display or digital view that they see.
So help us understand. So Tegra in the most recent quarter was about 15% of your
total revenues. Can you just help us quantify what percentage of that mix is
automotive? And I know automotive leadtimes are very long and you've got a pretty
solid pipeline of design wins. So help us understand -- give us a snapshot today of
automotive mix within Tegra and then kind of give us a sense for your pipeline andColette Kress
Unidentified Participant
Colette Kress
Unidentified Participanthow that pipeline unfolds from a revenue perspective as we look out, one, two, three
years as TK1 and Tegra X1 starts to become a bigger part of the mix in automotive?

I'll try. So in Q3 are automotive business again had a tremendous quarter. In Q3 our
overall automobile business almost doubled within the overall Tegra business.
In the prior two quarters again we had talked about it being near up 60% or 70%
year-over-year. So it doesn't have a perfect exact growth rate each quarter but what
is key is we had also announced key design wins within the -- in Q3.
We announced Honda in Europe with many of the different model numbers that you
would recognize for an everyday car. And that was a very important when as it talked
about what we announced again a year ago at CES with overall Android and
Android in the car and the overall coalition of a group of people working on Android
for the overall cars.
So it was an important win. Now keep in mind, we don't get to announce the actual
rollouts of where Tegra X1 will be used in the future as that is where car companies
are the ones that actually announce their cars. So we will have to stay tuned in terms
of when we see the next design wins associated with Tegra X1.
But the automobile business, our overall pipeline of design wins, we have designs
from multiple years of multiple different forms of Tegra as cars are still being
shipped and manufactured with that. As well we expect the new Tegra X1 to also play
a place in that. So it is a wide range and it is a very very strong pipeline going into
the future as well.
Can you give us a sense of maybe when you expect automotive -- because it does
feel like the pipeline is pretty full and you've got numerous design wins. So any
sense as to when we could expect the automotive subsegment within Tegra to cross
over the rest of the Tegra business?

You know, I think there is still tremendous opportunities in the rest of the Tegra
business as well. And we see growth in those businesses as well on many of the
embedded portions associated with gaming, gaming tablets, a very specific tablet
with the key horsepower of that application processor. So we will just have to see in
terms of when we may break that out and whether or not we will going forward.Colette KressOkay. Given that we are at the beginning of the year and as you think about your
product and design win pipeline in 2015, Colette, give us your view on what you
believe will be the drivers of your business this year in your computing and graphics
segments and data center and cloud and mobile. We talked about automotive but
give us your view on the different segments and the growth trajectories that we can
anticipate here in 2015.

So when we think about our entire portfolio, we talk about our overall GPU business,
which is really focused on several key platforms. The number one platform is our
overall gaming platform, probably the one that people know the most of our success
of the past.
A very very strong year this year in terms of our overall gaming results and our
gaming platform. We just released at the middle of Q3 our overall Maxwell
architecture and our high-end GPUs for that gaming business.
So that makes up a good portion of our overall GeForce GPUs in that business. So
where now we are looking at gaming representing about 75% of our overall GeForce
business and extremely healthy. In the Q3 for example, our gaming business for GPU
grew more than 30%, about 32% year-over-year. So very very strong and healthy,
largely inﬂuenced by the key innovations that we continue to bring forth.
People continuing to advance their experience and buying higher-end GPUs for
their gaming experience as well as our ability to really capture a good portion of that
share associated with the gaming market. So it's a very very important market for us,
a market that we think is tremendously healthy, also one that is continuing to grow
going forward.
Second key market or key platform for us is the overall data center in cloud. That
data center and cloud business is now not taking the overall graphics ability of the
GPU but the overall acceleration ability as it is dealing with data center workloads
and overall virtualization.
So for example, in the data center what you are seeing is an emergence of an
industry focused on deep learning, machine learning and overall computer analytics.
So what you see is people looking for image tagging, voice recognition, voice
translation abilities using the accelerator and the GPU as key in helping that
workload. Research in terms of high-end education is really bringing this forth and
we are seeing large Internet service providers build extremely large projects
associated with this GPU.
This is our overall Tesla business. We experienced record levels of Tesla both in Q3
and Q2 associated with the emergence of machine learning and deep analytics.Unidentified Participant
Colette KressSecondly, in our cloud and data center business is our overall GRID and our
virtualized GPU. Now we are taking a platform where you have normally had a GPU
associated with a one-to-one relationship, either one to the overall computer to the
user and now we are using a one-to-many where we have one GPU and we are able
to serve that up to many different types of users in a streaming overall environment.
We are just in the early stages of this business. We have been in market a little bit
over a year with key partners such as Citrix and VMware, who have truly adopted this
technology as a key leading indicator for virtualization of the future, really improving
that user experience on the end of many of the applications that are being streamed
down from an overall cloud experience. So those are also two key areas in the data
center and cloud which will drive overall growth going forward.
Then of course our focus on mobile. Everything that we see is moving to more and
more mobile types of devices. We are in the early stages of seeing the embedded
nature of the graphics associated with gaming tablets or high-end tablets really
necessary for the displays for the workloads that they want to complete.
Our embedded business and then of course our automotive business is a
tremendous growth opportunity for us. Again, I want to mostly talk about one key
aspect as well, which is our overall IP business. As you know we have some of the
largest amount of GPU technology and IP technology from a significant amount of
engineers that this is their life work.
We have an overall patent portfolio of more than 7,000 patents issued and pending
associated with the GPU technology. So there is really talking about an emergence
of not only using that technology in some of the products that we've gone forth. But
also the ability to license this in terms in the future with many different companies
that see this great technology and would like to either build their own devices, or
just have a license to that overall technology.
When we think about the licensing strategy I can envision several different routes for
the Company where you can license your patents. Obviously you can license your
circuit building blocks and certain other aspects of IP associated with the design. Is
there any one strategy that the team is more focused on, or less focused on as it
relates to the different aspects of the IP portfolio?

I wouldn't say we are focused on more than one in particular. I think they are all
viable options. What we find is it's not necessarily us driving but really the companies
coming forth and what they are interested in.
What you find in this new world is many different ways to solve a lot of their desires
and problems that they want in terms of this IP technology. So we are focused both
on protecting our IP and our IP being used without our approval and then we areUnidentified Participant

Q - Unidentified Participant
A - Colette Kressalso focused on helping companies bring this great technology into their devices.
Whether they want to license the core and be able to build their own devices, or
whether or not they just want patents, we are here to help them in any way.
And I'll just ask the question. But any updates on the ongoing litigation with
Samsung and Qualcomm?

So we are progressing. As you know the ITC shortly after we filed had agreed to
move towards an investigation. Then when that happens we actually get a hearing
date, which is now scheduled for June for both parties to actually represent their
overall case.
So we are pleased with the eﬃciency of the ITC. It's one of the main reasons why we
went through with the ITC as we will get to a point where we will be able to discuss
this case with a third party and hopefully get a ruling on the infringement.
Great. Are there any questions from the audience?
Questions And Answers
A couple of questions. Have you given any indication of the ASPs for the automotive
business?
And the second question is kind of more longer-term, if you think of a car as a
phone, what we've seen is a move to towards integrated components. So you have a
display processor, goes into the application processor with a conductivity
component on it and the RF and everything else. Do you think auto manufacturers
will take a different thought, which is they do prefer a standalone GPU and a
standalone conductivity module and they find the best of all worlds to put them
together, how is the world is evolving?

So let me first start with your first part of your question, which was really talking
about what type of ASPs are we talking about. I think the key thing to help
understand what we are bringing to the automotive world is not bringing just a chip,
as many of our other overall competitors may do. We are actually bringing a key
aspect of software and key software that has been programmed truly for the car and
really taking advantage of our overall CUDA development platform.Q - Unidentified Participant
A - Colette Kress
Q - Unidentified ParticipantWe have more software engineers at NVIDIA than we actually do hardware
engineers, really focused on building out the complex algorithms that are going to
be necessary for the cars of the future. So that's one aspect that we are looking at,
which is the software as being a key component of why the automotive industry is
buying these key modules for the car. B
But the second thing to keep in mind is its multiple aspects inside of a car. Now
we're talking about not only the cockpit, the infotainment system, the rear seat type
of infotainment system and now something that may sit in the trunk, which is really
helping the driver actually drive the car and auto assist. So we are now talking about
multiple chips and if you go to the booth actually today or tomorrow you will actually
see that we have a car there that has multiple chips inside of the car all doing
different things.
So to kind of lead to the second part of your question, how will this work, how will
car manufacturers and OEMs? It depends.
They all want to do it differently in terms of do they want to standardize on a single
module that is running all of that? Do they want to keep those modules separated?
The answer is, yes.
Depending on how they have put that together, those different things will occur. So
right now our ASPs are very different, of course because we are selling into market
many different type of form factors for what is going through. But you will soon see
that software is being the key driver of the overall ASPs of what they are buying
going forward.
(inaudible) are you selling to the module providers or to the OEMs?

So what we work with is in both. So we have definitely deep relationships actually
with the car manufacturers because that's where the key engineering and new
technology is going through. We may be providing directly to them or we may be
providing through the Tier 1s, Tier 2s for the actual completion and manufacturing
within the car. So the answer is, it is a complicated group but we have deep
relationships over 8, 10 years of working with both the manufacturers as well as the
Tier 1s.
Let's focus on the GeForce gaming segment of your business. I remember when I
first started covering NVIDIA five years ago and any time our hardware analyst would
change his PC forecast we would either raise or cut numbers on NVIDIA.
But over the years it has become quite a different business now. And in fact that
relationship has decoupled to a point where NVIDIA's GeForce gaming business, orA - Colette Kressthe GeForce business overall, is being more driven by the trends within the PC
gaming segment of the market, which has been growing significantly faster than the
overall PC market. And so if I just take a look at that part of your business, which is
still tied to the PC/OEM channel, as you mentioned, it is about 25% of your overall
GeForce business.
It's 25% of revenues but I am assuming that it's a much less percentage of your total
operating profits. Can you help us quantify what percentage of the operating profits
is the PC/OEM channel?

So our GeForce business is broken down into two major pieces, which is that gaming
portfolio where people are generally purchasing a high-end or midrange GPU to
conduct overall gaming. We don't have perfect insights in terms of exactly if they are
a casual gamer or a full-ﬂedged enthusiast types of gamer. But we can definitely tell
by the price points of the GPUs that they are purchasing.
We see them coming back for more and more innovation, which is necessary for the
gaming experience for the high-end games that continue to come out year on year.
We spent a good portion of our time not working on building the hardware but
really working with the overall software development in gaming to make sure that
that GPU is well configured at the point that those games come out so that the
experience of that end consumer is really concentrated on gaming.
So this is a significant part of our overall revenue. It doesn't represent a majority or
even near a majority of the overall PC market. The PC market is much much larger as
it is associated with just enterprise and consumer types of PCs.
And in many cases you are buying a discrete GPU you may not be upgrading your
overall PC. You may just be going in, opening up the back and inserting your latest
and greatest high-end GPU for your overall gaming experience. So there is still a
significant amount of volume with overall general PC shipments, what I would
consider to be a general-purpose PC whether that be for the enterprise and the
consumer.
It is still a part of our business, it's still important to us. There are many different
options for a consumer. They have different options in terms of discrete offerings or
they have offerings in terms of an integrated.
We will continue to play in there. Keep in mind it's a very cost competitive type of
business. When you have cost competitive what you are dealing with is probably not
our highest margins of our business and what we have.
So there is a low percentage of our overall revenue. We have indicated it is less than
25% of our GeForce business and it's even a lesser % as you think about overall
profitability or gross margin associated with that business. But again we will still playQ - Unidentified Participant
A - Colette Kress
Q - Unidentified Participant
A - Colette Kressin that business as we do still see it as an important part to make sure we have our
share of across all of PCs.
Then in that 75% of your GeForce business, which is tied to gaming, that business as
you mentioned was up 36% year-over-year in the most recent quarter. You have
obviously got your next-generation Maxwell architecture ramping. But at the same
time this is October -- I've got a 15-year-old son so I know all this -- October,
November is when the blockbuster games get launched.
You had Assassin's Creed, you have Call of Duty Advanced Warfare and a whole
bunch of other games. And so of the growth that you are seeing right now I don't
know if you guys have ever studied this. But what percentage of that growth is driven
by blockbuster game introductions versus just the traction that you're getting with
the new Maxwell architecture?

I think it's hard to differentiate where and what happens because it's both of them
are important. There's many times that you will buy a GPU to make your existing
games that you have even work better. So it's not always waiting for the new games
that are coming out but it can be both.
You made buy the GPU knowing that you are going to buy a new set of games going
forward. You may be buying it for whatever you have purchased in the past.
And that is the key thing about our architecture it is configured so that it works
across all. It is not just what is coming out going forward.
So there are definitely pockets of gaming where a big amount of games come out
but what we see is gaming is a yearly event that happens all the time. It doesn't
necessarily just peek at any point in time. So we are seeing very good overall year-to-
date results not just in terms of a single quarter.
When I think about NVIDIA, I think about some of the most complicated chips in the
world. I think you guys are probably driving about 1 billion transistors per chip right
now. And so when I tend to think about NVIDIA I tend to think about Moore's law
and then I tend to think about staying on the bleeding edge of manufacturing
technology.
And so for the team I think ahead of you you still have either the migration to 20
nanometers or 16 nanometer and 14 nanometer FinFET technology. Help us
understand the manufacturing roadmaps and when does NVIDIA feel it is the right
time to be intercepting these new manufacturing process builds?
Q - Unidentified Participant
A - Colette KressSo manufacturing process is not a short-term decision. It is something that we've
been working on for many years in terms of when is that right time to change to the
next manufacturing node. So you will see us continue to come out with both process
and changes to different nodes but then also continuing to evolve the overall
innovation.
And so each one of them are different steps in our overall ability to provide the key
products that we need to stay at the top and as you indicated the leading edge of
the technology in terms of the GPU. But it is well thought through.
It is well thought through in terms of those manufacturing changes, really thinking
about the volumes, the costs associated with any of that. So we don't have anything
to announce but once the new products come out we will talk about the new
manufacturing process nodes.
Okay. Let's focus on the financials. The team is going to drive 12% to 14% revenue
growth in calendar year 2014 while at the same time obviously the team has done a
great job in terms of the OpEx discipline.
I think your OpEx only grew about 4% in calendar 2014 and this has been obviously
largely responsible for driving almost 450 basis points of up margin expansion. How
should we think about the longer-term trends within OpEx relative to revenue
growth? Should we continue to expect leverage on the OpEx, or is the team more
focused on driving top-line growth and continuing to invest at a heavy pace in the
business via R&D?

So far year-to-date in our fiscal 2015 through the end of Q3 overall top-line revenue
growth, as you mentioned, is at 15%. We have also had Second Quarter and near Q3
record levels in terms of overall gross margin. So they are sitting around 55.5% to
56%. So also extremely strong performance on gross margin.
But what has been key is our overall operating profit. Keep in mind in fiscal year 2013
and fiscal year 2012 were key times we're moving to the platforms that we have
today. The overall investments that was necessary for the overall data center in the
cloud and really moving to the overall mobile infrastructure that we have today.
What that took was fiscal year 2015 is to tap out into the overall investment level. Our
operating income so far year-to-date through the end of Q3 has grown 50%. So
really a focus on profitability and really leveraging the investments that we had done
over the last couple of years.
So moving into the new year we will talk about at the end of Q4 our overall
investment strategy going into our fiscal year 2016. But what you can expect us to do
is to make sure that A, we think about our overall investments necessary to continueQ - Unidentified Participant
A - Colette Kress
Q - Unidentified Participant
A - Colette Kressthe success of some of our key growth platforms but we must continue to look for
the overall eﬃciencies in the leverage across our overall portfolio as well.
So we will talk about this more as we go into fiscal year 2016. But it is a focus of ours
thinking about that right balance from investment and profitability.
So assuming that the revenue continues to grow at a healthy clip and the team
continues to drive an OpEx growth that is lower than the revenue growth, obviously
that still paints a picture of margin expansion. We have the team delivering low 20%
operating margins this calendar year. Longer term where can the upper end of the
operating margin spectrum be?

So again I am not here to be able to really give forward-looking guidance. We will
really talk about that as we move into fiscal year 2016. But as we've talked about, the
really key growth platforms that we have -- the question is which of them and how
fast will each one of them grow.
So we've got some tremendous opportunities both in gaming, in data center and
cloud, in mobile, automobile and our IP portfolio. So I think these are extremely solid
businesses where we have really shown the overall technology achievements and
now the question is how fast can they grow going forward and what is that overall
mix of them moving forward. So more to come later but that's where we sit right
now.
Great. Well we are just about out of time. Colette, thank you very much.
Appreciate you participating. Thank you.

Thank you. So much.
