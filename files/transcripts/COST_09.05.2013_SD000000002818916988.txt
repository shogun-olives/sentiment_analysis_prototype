Good morning. And thank you for calling Costco Wholesale Corp. I'm Jeff Elliott,
Assistant Vice President of Finance and IR. And this morning I will review with you
our sales results for the four-week retail month of August, which started on Monday,
August 5. And ended on Sunday, September 1.
For comparable sales results, this four-week period is compared to the same four-
week period last year, specifically Monday, August 6 through Sunday, September 2.
August included 20 selling days in both years.
Before I begin, let me start by stating that the following discussion will include
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. For these purposes, forward-looking statements are statements
that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company
expects or anticipates may occur in the future. Such forward-looking statements
involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual events, results or
performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.
These risks and uncertainties include. But not are limited to, domestic and
international economic conditions including exchange rates; the effects of
competition and regulation; uncertainties in the financial markets; consumer and
small business spending patterns and debt levels; conditions affecting the
acquisition, development, ownership or use of real estate; amounts expected to be
spent on expansion plans; actions of vendors; rising costs associated with
employees, including healthcare costs; energy and certain commodities;
geopolitical conditions and other risks identified from time to time in the Company's
public statements and reports filed with the SEC. The Company does not undertake
any obligation to update these discussions due to subsequent events or
circumstances.
Now, with regard to sales; as reported in today's press release, net sales for the
month of August came in at $7.95 billion for the four weeks ended September 1, up
7% compared to the $7.44 billion reported for the same period last year.For the 16-week Fourth Quarter, the Company reported net sales of $31.8 billion, an
increase of 1% compared to net sales of $31.5 billion in the 17-week Fourth Quarter of
fiscal year 2012, ended September 2, 2012.
For the 52-week fiscal year ended September 1, 2013, the Company reported net
sales of $102.9 billion, an increase of 6% from the $97.1 billion reported in the 53-
week fiscal year 2012.
Keep in mind that the extra week in last year's Fourth Quarter in '12 fiscal year make a
diﬃcult compare from a sales growth perspective.
Comparable sales results for the four-week August retail month, 16-week Fourth
Quarter and 52-week fiscal year were as follows. US, four weeks, plus 4%; US, 16
weeks or Fourth Quarter, plus 5%; US, 52 weeks, plus 6%; International, four weeks,
plus 2%; International, 16 weeks, plus 4%; International 52 weeks, plus 6%; total
Company, four weeks, plus 4%; total Company, 16 weeks, plus 5%; and total
Company, 52 weeks, plus 6%.
For the four-week period, changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange rates
both had a negative impact on comparable sales. For the 16-week Fourth Quarter
and 52-week fiscal year, changes in gasoline prices had an immaterial impact on
comparable sales, while changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact in
both periods.
Excluding these effects, comparable sales were as follows. US, four weeks, plus 5%;
US, 16 weeks, plus 5%; US, 52 weeks, plus 6%; International, four weeks, plus 8%;
International, 16 weeks, plus 7%; International 52 weeks, plus 6%; total Company,
four weeks, plus 6%; total Company, 16 weeks, plus 5%; and total Company, 52
weeks, plus 6%.
In terms of regional merchandising categories, the general highlights for the month
of August were as follows. On a regional and country basis, US regions with the
strongest sales results were the Southeast, Midwest and Texas. On an international
basis, in local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Canada and in Mexico.
Moving to our merchandising highlights, the following comparable sales results by
category exclude the negative impact of foreign exchange. Food and Sundries,
comparable sales for the month were in the mid single-digit range. Within Food and
Sundries, the departments with the strongest results were candy, cooler and frozen
foods. We experienced a very low level of inﬂation during August for Food and
Sundries compared to last year.
Comparable sales result for Hardlines were slightly positive for the month. Better
performing departments were health and beauty aids, oﬃce and lawn and garden.
Consumer electronics were negative for the month.Softlines experienced positive comp sales results in the low double-digit range.
Better performing departments within Softlines included small appliances,
domestics, apparel and jewelry.
Fresh Foods experienced positive comps results in the high single-digit range for the
month. Service, selling and produce experienced the strongest results. Fresh Foods
experienced slight price inﬂation for the month compared to last year; basically, the
same as it's been running for the last several months.
Within the Ancillary businesses, pharmacy, hearing aid and optical produced the
best comp sales increases. Gasoline comp sales were down low single digit year
over year. The average sale price per gallon was down 4%, lower at $3.59 this year
compared to $3.75 last year. Overall, gasoline price inﬂation had negative impact of
about minus 0.5% on total August comparable sales. Comp gallons were slightly up
year over year.
Weakening foreign currencies relative to the US dollar resulted in a detriment to our
reported August comp sales of just a little under 1.5%. Total international comps for
the four-week period came in at plus 8% local currencies. But resulted in a reported
comp of plus 2% when converted to US dollars.
The average transaction was down 1.5% year over year, which includes a basically
minus 2% combined negative impact from foreign exchange and gasoline prices,
gasoline price deﬂation. So a total of 2% for those two things combined.
Comparable traﬃc frequency was up 5.25%.
Cannibalization for the month of August had a negative impact to total comp sales
of about 0.75% or 75 basis points.
Looking ahead, the five-week September sales month will include 34 selling days for
both years. The reporting period will end on Sunday, October 6 and will be
compared to the five weeks ended Sunday, October 7 last year.
We plan to announce September sales along with our Fourth Quarter operating
