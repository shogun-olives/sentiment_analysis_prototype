thank much yes absolutely recommend think 2 model 3 navigate autopilot basically highway autonomy available customer basically wanted walk business trying go first thing think many would already know 3 product currently sell vehicle vast majority gross profit storage generation solar generation think automotive industry general think one thing notice automotive industry today spread across various different technology word every single carmaker need continue invest engine time investing fuel cell ev hybrid mild hybrid et cetera et cetera really focusing one thing one thing get electric car work get cheap possible et cetera et cetera order build model 3 build largest battery factory world gigafactory reno wanting put something unidentified participant martin viechaperspective significant factory last year 2018 look electric vehicle sold around world total number battery used ev 46 gigawatt hour battery 1.1 million ev sold last year time roughly average 49 kilowatt hour average battery pack size 46 gigawatt hour global production electric vehicle battery capacity today installed capacity today 44 gigawatt hour 35 gigawatt hour gigafactory reno remaining 9 gigawatt hour panasonic japan size absolutely matter come reducing cost making battery thing wanted point look epa range highest range vehicle market today range model sure thing laser model range orange bar middle upper right side ... tried click anything anyways fine range model seven year ago still beaten electric car introduced since time model range increased seven year 100 mile roughly 270 mile 370 mile today really fascinating thing model left part chart almost battery size audi right side chart one range 204 mile one range 370 mile yet battery pack size roughly difference come powertrain think underrated technology conversation investor come general feeling anyone make powertrain anyone make electric motor electric motor around decade true make electric motor incredibly eﬃcient fast acceleration high top speed cheap make last 1 million mile attribute combined actually complicated important part far energy eﬃciency know example mpg example toyota corolla much better mpg chevy camaro metric look equivalent metric mile per kilowatt hour easy calculate take epa range electric vehicle 310 mile model 3 divided battery size get 4.0 mile per kilowatt hour eﬃciency see difference model 3 rest industry quite substantial part story second part story acceleration actually significantly faster well better acceleration better top speed eﬃciency chart basically telling model 3 pretty much half battery size half cost compared still epa range take combination take okay battery pack relatively cheap build motor enables long range result combination 2 thing trailing 12 month u.s. electric vehicle delivery 2 thing wanted highlight chart number one 100 growth coming single product model 3 thing wanted highlight orange bar orange area bottom actually gently declining ev combined chevy bolt nissan leaf jaguar audi fact seen absolutely growth electric vehicle sale past 2.5 year yet quite new entrant came market quite odd reason new car maker coming ev yet absolutely impact volume would actually say 1 reason country mile price car electric vehicle 5 popular electric vehicle u.s would say price electric vehicle u.s. extremely high compared equivalent look left see audi base price 75,000 buy 50,000 slightly bigger slightly faster audi q7 story story chevy bolt nissan leaf dramatically expensive competitor hand look model 3 model 3 price model 3 first electric vehicle history priced par equivalent word subsidy tax incentive fuel saving base ticket price par equivalent actually model 3 basic equipment autopilot satellite navigation parking sensor lot kit would pay car brand give customer choice give equal choice roughly price get ev get combustion engine vehicle result le 12 month sale model 3 started outsell bmw 3 series audi a4 lexus mercedes jaguar xe combined never seen automotive industry maybe toyota corolla came u.s. market first time completely blitzed competition extremely rare see industry one point since july 2018 one year later happened last 12 month model 3 substantially higher number sale main competitor combined reason lot people say hey carmaker going start ev well mean mercedes going electric version going sell 3 time many unit regular probably probably something else vehicle people like electricity actually like short list thing think different model 3 car reason people want buy model 3 firstly design design vehicle ground electric extend interior space highly recommend going drive later see interior space quite bit bigger equivalent gas engine vehicle simply gas engine extend interior size secondly decluttered interior sure remember using iphone first time 2007 2008 felt bit weird compared using blackberry right like probably missing button diﬃcult text month realized way back much nicer decluttered nice simple interface exactly tried model 3 software update 4g another thing think fairly fascinating apple introduced software update 12 year ago introduced software update car seven year ago aware carmaker introduced software update ﬂeet even significant amount time passing supercharger learned basically impossible mass sell electric vehicle without charging network people buy car 90 journey 95 journey people buy car 100 journey result absolutely need supercharging network allow people distance travel store important one much customer perspective mostly business perspective dealership generally speaking want sell electric vehicle want sell electric vehicle maintenance cost reoccurring revenue profit generation pretty limited electric vehicle carmaker really sorry dealership really incentivized sell many ev exactly many carmaker forced build dealer network bmw dealer network able sell ev lastly course autopilot thing wanted speak many people tell well unsustainable massive gap u versus competitor combined make sense sustainable actually something behind 12 database ever received people buying model 3 people traded vehicle 12 driving another midsize premium sedan like mercedes like bmw 3 series et cetera 25 came premium vehicle mercedes suv bmw 5 series et cetera et cetera completely different car 63 coming nonpremium vehicle every single year portion population transfer nonpremium premium disproportionately group people choosing model 3 sort grabbing people jump say corolla camrys car first entry premium disproportional model 3 mean cash generation chart volume volume grown thanks model 3 overlay free cash ﬂow see quite bit similarity free cash ﬂow mean operating cash ﬂow minus capex main debate q2 far gross margin topic getting far question gross margin headline number declined 20 19 see take regulatory credit underlying gross margin actually improved 200 basis point 17.2 q2 global expansion approach go well today making model 3 fremont california basically build currently building simpler version production line shanghai china building similar vehicle suv suv based model 3 called model 78 component commonality model 3 going build fremont california bit year basically take approach model china europe course top preparing new product well pickup truck unveil hopefully later year semi truck roadster people ask working automotive industry life main difference tesla every carmaker every company ever worked far 1 difference seen pace innovation try give one example original roadster stopped making original roadster 2012 time able produce 10 unit week probably q unidentified participant martin viecha q unidentified participant martin viecha q unidentified participant martin viecha q unidentified participantwas good car five year later started produce model 3 hailed journalist one best car ever made make 5,000 6,000 week consistently easily 70 cheaper make original roadster five year later also look happening shanghai gigafactory shanghai january year remember time picture started come online want start producing car end year like madness six month later look like actually shell look inside story stamping press getting ready robot body welding hopefully going start inviting investor shanghai early next year people see important part next leg growth story company thank much question answer inaudible sir shelf life ... usability long car work well ... inaudible got well model 3 warranty 120,000 mile essentially roughly mileage roughly scrappage mileage car america car get scrapped average would 120,000 150,000 mile clock gave warranty 120,000 mile think battery also warranty course mean model s x run 200,000 300,000 400,000 mile still working talk little bit storage generation inaudible martin viecha q unidentified participant martin viecha q unidentified participant martin viecha q unidentified participant absolutely storage generation think personally much excited storage part growth seen really strong last year deployed 1 gigawatt hour energy storage year going roughly double number fairly significant growth continue year well recently launched new product called megapack used powerwall powerpack megapack megapack essentially incredibly large version battery pack deployed quickly around world peaker plant want attach existing factory et cetera et cetera course currently negotiating several different party whether different government different state installation megapacks bit excited inaudible correct essentially cell production right place time decided divert cell model 3 cell production significantly better start selling powerwalls higher volume used wanted buy powerwall year ago would like six month waiting time lot better get one pretty quickly mentioned store part strategy going number store last year elon month ago elon said close rationalize ﬂows sale current situation yes think opening new store closed many main thing focusing service center trying open many service center possibly think opened like 26 service center last quarter added 100 vehicle mobile service ﬂeet service center think believe main driver need infrastructure long people see service city bunch supercharging station city like going make go online buy car store growth noticed historically really generate much demand portion customer test driven car martin viecha q unidentified participant martin viecha q unidentified participant martin viecha q unidentified participant martin viecha q unidentified participant martin viecha q unidentified participant think last number gave statistic end q1 would say past year number model 3 bought without test drive 70 super high simply think people read review online review great friend take drive somebody else take drive car buy instead peer people buy data whether actually driven another vehicle et cetera would data mean reason ask would ask question vehicle purchase inaudible small correct absolutely question actually make available going line inaudible actually make available demand would likely little bit higher potentially yes like theory lot thing could moment think still phase lot growth opportunity europe example sorry production ... want talk detail sensitive topic already talked last earnings call ... inaudible martin viecha q unidentified participant martin viecha q unidentified participant martin viecha q unidentified participant martin viecha generally speaking like u.s. outselling competitor combined europe outselling single one main competitor much potential growth europe u.k. specifically example think worry maybe one fact one question inaudible know anniversary tomorrow inaudible 40 growth capital capex mainly capex declining steadily fund growth talk presentation cost equity cost debt going equity go back presentation mean see actually happening like u presenting u real building going start producing thing wanted highlight deployment step 2 model going uncomparably cheaper deployment model 3 simply much production line shared 3 capex necessary going fraction needed model 3 second thing wanted mention many carmaker building new factory building new plant around world many result go kuka fanuc component supplier fact company building factory get reﬂected lastly payment term capex side better ever thank thank
