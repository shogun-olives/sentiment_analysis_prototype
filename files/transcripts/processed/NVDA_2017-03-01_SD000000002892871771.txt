joe mayer morgan stanley research happy today colette kress nvidia wish colette meeting last year listened everything told believed laughter inaudible lot better guy great year obviously thank much know lot anticipation maybe get right maybe start gaming business seems like focus people right 59 revenue great year grew 44 59 sequentially third quarter never seen business size kind kind unexpected growth talk drove make guy bullish gaming base going forward sure gaming basis company 15 20 year built company one key application gpu gaming really changed approach gaming last several year last year one key year u well last year continuing evolve overall gaming industry gaming industry used start play right overall computer really moved social platform moved social platform playing friend one gamer time usually playing overall friend approach enable gaming platform every type gamer lot different card last year took place term enabling pascal come market pascal amazing architecture architecture using across company importantly term launch term gaming brought market probably card ever done shorter period time successful overall launch strong acceptance card performance performance improvement detainable ph last generation substantial even platform many year essentially type thought term upgrade potential could approach pascal architecture opportunity u enable future ever want play vr ability term pascal combination see term expanding market gamers gamers coming onboard social experience gamers staying longer gamers coming onboard broadband access never past ability enjoy see term sister country nearby also probably best architecture best overall platform term market able continue increase unit increase overall asp gamers lot discussion say well strong second half talking gaming overall result growing 60 year year two quarter underlying fundamental gaming industry still still taking place thing change ph u last night also san francisco gdc street actually announced yet another pascal card announced 1080 ti 35 performance improvement existing 1080 market also made room term overall price point 1080 come 699 price point enabling different type enthusiastic gamers partake term gaming different type price point great card still believe healthy part market u capture joe mayer colette kress joe mayer guess parse product cycle aspect pascal obviously huge cycle talked reason people adopting faster rolled lot family quicker although actually pretty exciting new family talk adoption cycle sort consolidate revenue gain point see number continuing grow level think guess also encouraging seen growth pc gaming software stronger seen long time well last couple quarter much adoption cycle versus growth aspect population inaudible yes think good question rollout different platform upgrade complete answer absolutely overall cycle often actually refresh overall gaming platform may somewhere four year still early u tell take four year determine cycle still compare look well last architecture term maxwell still really early two quarter selling overall pascal process take half four year far moving faster little bit faster pascal feel great think see establishment gamers also overall driving ability sell term additional unit necessarily refresh take u little bit time see probably see continue refreshing occur way current year okay helpful guess one helpful distinction guy made last year oem versus gaming oem declining gaming actually growing good clip quite time showing getting bigger part number talk little bit parsing seen shift colette kress joe mayer colette kress joe mayer sure took opportunity couple year ago really concentrate game platform sell gpus pc probably several one audience today said sure little bit graphic capability want certain application different level play several game really market build certain platform exclusively gaming market classify gaming time range probably 100 price point market feel people spending much money actually see geforce experience sign download driver game ability actually look say yes intended use overall gaming platform actually used gaming essentially split overall oem business small part business represents probably le 5 business necessarily growish time still point overall pc growth even discrete gpu attached strong reason term something would buy term pc still strategically aligned oems pc platform term supporting different price point different asp significant amount volume mass amount pc small part business okay helpful divisive point term gaming business think investor map much growth price versus unit know go distinction maybe qualitatively people view price seems u unit price actually pricing changed much maxwell pascal probably getting people trading skus talk little bit yes good old discussion asp versus unit growth colette kress joe mayeryou give top line could could go take opportunity year look seen historically last couple year term asp unit growth gaming keep mind looked day day month month given launch sometimes launch know going volume play launch know going card going certain part market essentially drive asp looking short period time may interesting thing pop done looked long period time based see factor seeing seeing growth term unit seeing growth asp last five year overall gaming business half year ago growing 30 30 growth top line faster yes overall gaming market talked unit growth probably 9 asp growth 11 multiplying factor get overall 30 finish fiscal year 2017 growth term around little bit higher 30 probably higher type cagr period factor occurring nothing materially changed strong part ph 2017 helped think still seeing aspect growth asp well growth term unit responded ph increase price pascal answer really think overall price performance said another way saying many time actually getting performance better price goal goal overall increase price turn seeing people continuing choose card play game truly see benefit sometimes playing exact game better gpu better experience like playing different game get benefit upgrading next time buying gpu higher card also therefore overall asp grip okay helpful colette kress joe mayer colette kressthen element people ask way boosting dollar per customer whether founder edition card selling dram kind thing sense thing pretty small address yes pretty small get question founder edition goal overall excitement term founder edition small percentage think launch process work last night gamer actually able receive 1080 ti next week put founder edition allows u build board ready close launch possible take excitement launch feel excitement week actually received still small percentage price point founder edition also slightly higher keep mind also different component felt actually selling company would expect component rich component could put given volume play term component slightly higher price keep really overall purpose keep excitement launch receive overall card quite quickly one piece right material part okay great overall sound like pretty constructive growth gaming segment guess view discontinuity recently yet seems like guidance generally seasonal kind result way looking current quarter yes gaming market seasonality probably one one seasonality see versus market seasonality stronger second half year first half year sometimes growth term second half year largely inﬂuenced holiday season mean season worldwide holiday western world inﬂuences seen going likely see first half different seen second half year given strength fiscal year 2017 seasonality still given see term q1 seasonality probably continue joe mayer colette kress joe mayer colette kress joe mayer okay great one last question gaming topic amd competition time last year feel like people worried amd polaris turned pretty much entry level platform well entry level talking vega challenging high end least aspiration talk hearing customer think market share sure competing amd since beginning time discrete market player different way go market though really different way actually approach gamer look surround ecosystem around gamer geforce experience additional feature enable certain game working overall software developer approach oem sale delightful partner channel work reach different gamers although amd continue path gone market ph say let talk performance still also continued performance think gamers demand u demand brand loyalty think know compete competing heard might come vega talking think well prepared think 1080 ti significantly better even 1080 seen comparison comparing vega 1080 sure following type game always know always something better come okay think 1080 ti even already great piece u launch okay helpful colette kress joe mayer colette kressand leave graphic business want touch enterprise pro visualization business guy talked gdp growth type business yet grew double digit last year talk drove possibility optimization sure pro visualization importance using graphic enterprise key many different type business importance mobility key collaboration overall work seen mobile workforce term wanting performance gpu light moving form factor allow take work work everywhere continued move gpus thin workstation overall get coming secondly see ability render spot ability render quickly smooth process timing gpus leveraging gpu use rendering taking advantage gpus becoming successful term growth rate pleased growth rate proviz mature established leadership position able grow 11 last year continue focus mobility continue focus enabling better better rendering move forward going option okay great shifting gear mean obviously exciting part story le divisive think one excited business grew 144 last year 14 sale amount ph starting really move needle give u overview business maybe talk split compute traditional part deep learning business like grid yes success datacenter business could pleased know lot folk datacenter business really talk growth rate leave q4 tripling pretty good part enable many different business underneath think would good u understand different piece yes computing business computing business u eight 10 year solving mathematical computation using accelerated computing area sure derive overall formula move working parallel function breaking apart know answer using accelerated computing gpu successful business still growing quite nicely core part starting point datacenter business last couple year seen evolution beginning ai primarily use deep learning training started one second business deep learning overall hyperscales using deep learning training application workload use every day search command voice search command image detection natural language processing video encoding thing see business definitely thriving great opportunity u thirdly also seen evolution say get enterprise move ai deep learning computing capability accelerated computing using gpu enterprise past maybe 10 15 year ago department would go build seeing cloud instance cloud instance cloud service provider enabling gpu instance also key component datacenter business many cloud service provider seen continue launch gpu instance gpu instance used many thing one definitely ai deep learning training enterprise get started term already set thing would cloud number two also ability virtualization cloud ability put workstation application pc cloud available virtualized scenario well number three overall compute want computing cloud also overall capability area third business growing take u overall grid business grid business outside cloud also enterprise installing business well order expand overall workforce collaboration tied overall workstation able show across world joe mayer colette kressthen lastly dgx supercomputing ai also ability enterprise talking fully contained ai supercomputer eight gpus overall computing development platform inclusive different framework deep learning ability enterprise plug get started see right big excitement around ai five different business ai ph probably growing piece definitely term datacenter business thank deep learning piece particular think pretty exciting given priority cloud company putting deep learning thing enabling term particularly visual data entirely new function guess hard business size know sort resisted temptation put cap big get think multiple year runway think term attach rate traditional cpu think thing supporting workload yes good question think challenge would refer hesitation ph think think diﬃcult first couple year take dot extrapolate line hard problem say first couple inning seeing term ai market think truly believe see datacenter see ai new computing model u decade move forward still early stage hard second part question though say start attach rate cpu another way could term workload answer ﬂaws term way come approach say percentage single digit half billion dollar necessarily overly accurate stage seeing get little bit farther think would little bit easier think important look type workload interested and/or type industry interested probably one key thing surrounding anything data following data significant amount data either structured and/or joe mayer colette kressunstructured could leveraged powerful useful end user could apply ability deep learning training essentially say let computer write program understand overall information area seeing rise ph different application talked hyperscales also see industry large amount data finance automotive see also retailer trying process amount information whether inventory buying pattern use term ai manner think going see continuation workload expand industry expand far determine fast one move forward focus endorsing working different type framework deep learning knowing one popular knowing one trended towards certain workload making sure empower additional code additional library starting capability get ai everywhere approach great thinking standpoint kind training building neural network versus inference deploying using environment seems clear guy dominating least early stage training instruction set cuda instruction set sort de facto way solving problem also best graphic engine certainly help think inference natural advantage training work way inference market status kind going specialty today think inference happening cpu even intel saying going lot specialty silicon used inference application gpu prospect space yes really good question inference new something right dominated cpu could anything custom asic given complexity inference could right definitely opportunity gpu work done training also definitely capable term inference phase ph gpu today essentially really really large capable custom asic case lot different job time one complete architecture together built purpose core competency joe mayer colette kresspushing capable custom asic something good continue move forward move inference going necessary gpu thing need voice command thing need voice processing prime example gpu may well suited inference vast wide market going many different type inferencing solution term microprocessor probably going focusing focus term high end necessary okay great one datacenter question open audience question move auto financial stuff talked dgx getting corporate environment actually heard department working training project happened kind faster would thought sort least getting awareness enterprise environment talk little bit thing differently selling enterprise versus selling hyperscale yes think good question yes finance industry excited ability work dgxs get started quite quickly sophisticated department capability essentially containerized ability start overall ai moving faster expected actually believed way enterprise would likely go market get excited ai prepare knowledge deep learning knowledge deep learning training framework put box essentially agnostic whatever framework wanted concentrated continuing evolve even make better better allows quick start u taking part middleware worry worry application letter inaudible worry data bring already started significant amount work joe mayer colette kress joe mayer unidentified participant colette kressbut also took u enabling working enterprise yes relationship computing different type market different type user seen u term expansion sale force sale enabling working different enterprise seen quite globally reaching spreading word additionally many different program continue train enterprise deep learning call deep learning institute amount training hour people like want learn deep learning work u using training hour teach enterprise additionally sure enterprise mean go purchase end system also working startup many many different ai startup inception program allows fresh start helping cache side hardware side go get started term business thing done continue spread building piece hardware significant amount software significant amount socialization training continue enterprise yes took cuda dummy class developer conference amsterdam actually surprisingly easy pick say probably one biggest part drink line multiple speaker let stop see question audience maybe could comment inventory little bit know elevated level balance sheet also comment inventory sits gaming partner aib ph guy like msi gigabyte colorful pallet ph compare last year happy inventory level q unidentified participant colette kress joe mayersure inventory level take part different architecture across different business keep mind gaming inventory related pascal architecture probably something launched term last night term overall inventory getting ready term launch piece keep mind gaming business working supplying overall chip adding card partner also significant amount kitting actually kit overall memory together part practice good part overall inventory associated lot platform well unique different market outside gaming case quadro workstation well datacenter selling multiple year architecture selling coupler selling maxwell selling pascal unique enterprise versus see normally gaming always keeping different thing assure capability lock infrastructure done continue add onto overall inventory really represents see term future sale well think need term supporting different architecture question answer term inventory customer seems recurring fear much customer would gamers think multiple speaker talked term channel color good ability see worldwide good market share healthy channel relationship individually partner consistent timing year timing around different holiday timing term term new architecture comfortable overall channel level q unidentified participant colette kress q unidentified participant colette kressany question audience thank large datacenter company company datacenters like google facebook microsoft rumored working deep learning chip particularly google happens effect business yes would surprise anybody one would look say something want purchase something could actually build always going pro con term type solution lot approach say want build custom asic piece inference piece machine learning different statement want build complete custom asic deep learning training much much harder bigger challenge go keep mind company agile generally coming launching something quite often going keep quite toe term capability move quite fast sometimes time may process overnight think want come something custom may market next day something got something overall balance lot different way solve inference problem solve machine learning simpler type data problem versus capability performance gpu really really hard substitute destroy significant amount value gain got term time tco leveraging overall gpu wo surprise u going necessarily change believe vast market large market gpu may also instance custom asic may well sort compare contrast see hyperscale relative traditional enterprise something particular relevant hyperscale customer maybe much relevant traditional enterprise seeing joe mayer q unidentified participant colette kress q unidentified participant colette kress q unidentified participant colette kressyes mean good question say would enterprise look building something going challenging looking talent actually build actually short process keep mind think nvidia thousand thousand developer whose focus gpu living done entire career probably largest workforce associated building design anything else world think see large thing enterprise would already seeing right fulfilling dgx container type approach and/or leveraging cloud meeting significant amount current demand want go necessarily ai approached overall still early say think correct mean get talent justify overall time market ability outperform something would commercially available u might something might look still may meet exact need gpus right time one quick one quick question basically barrier increase processing power bandwidth memory talk something nvidia looking next couple year improve also comment quickly longer term like three outlook gaming datacenter demand gpus thanks multiple speaker last half sorry question gaming datacenter datacenter demand gpu cagr ph mix anything growth rate growth rate sure could go ph hit long term one joe mayerlet take first part question first term memory essentially question scale scale depending workload going matter term put together want get overall scale go consistently memory always continued work term architecture overall bus express memory overall gpu well term core architecture hardware chip right challenge term memory continue work many workload even close issue see overall need long term term gaming datacenter little crystal ball would lovely piece hard say business healthy driver inﬂuenced u last year still go away changed clock moved 2017 overall growth rate speed growth really hard u say colette thank much helpful
