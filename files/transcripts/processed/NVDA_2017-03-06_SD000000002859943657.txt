right good morning name steve smigie semiconductor analyst raymond james pleasure nvidia presenting u morning colette kress chief financial oﬃcer nvidia welcome thank let start strategy question talking second ago made think important strategic decision focus year ago reward pretty good hoping would talk u little bit guy three year ago get coming okay let see first kind overview little bit nvidia necessarily going way back 20 year really last five year stand today keep mind nvidia business model focused four market segment participate first one participate gaming business gaming business u since beginning time focused creating best graphic overall pc platform steve smigie colette kressadditionally also pro visualization business pro visualization essentially taking graphic enterprise key workload term design product design building graphic key important well thirdly data center business quite bit focus recently data center business take little bit different focus necessarily graphic really talking gpu center function overall compute accelerated computing recent right working ai deep learning key function workload stemming data center fourth business automotive automotive business combination infotainment platform provide graphic center console digital dashboard also significant amount work future autonomous driving using ai platform similar ai platform see within data center using build autonomous car moving forward four business one thing common actually exact technology underneath unified platform approach using gpu across four different segment start basis company built gpu invented gpu time ago continued advance last three year focusing platform approach moving away looking business term component component inside pc component inside server looking full system solution focus strength hardware performance overall development platform development language overall tool library order use individual workload strategic approach allowed u move extremely diﬃcult challenging problem center like focus area easy solve focusing artificial intelligence deep learning well autonomous car helpful u term creating strategy going forward great thank within major area outlined hoping would talk little bit thinking growth seems hyper growth gaming seems solid growing much faster would anticipated maybe rate various reason business color growth would great yes business four business definitely different stage maturity rather actually saying different stage growth think overall gaming business gaming business least last five year type cagr grown 30 last year even grew stronger 30 seeing continuation importance gaming moving situation gamers actually playing pc back actually playing social experience becoming social platform multitude friend playing online friend also evolution esports esports really spectator type sport essentially watching others learning better play watching video others game become key part gaming essentially gaming sport mature business definitely grown faster underlying growth probably multiple factor associated better game coming social platform also u growing overall gaming market overall tam address overall platform moved pro visualization business mature business leading position gpus considered term type product design building design may want anything may want film industry term special effect tended something grown line maybe gdp line average enterprise going solving many enterprise graphic problem see last year though strong year growing 11 growth largely due moving higher performance mobile type application workstation use graphic card moving data center hard say term seen tremendous growth overall data center business data center business last three year let call 50 growth rate last year grew 145 q4 tripled strong trajectory really honed challenging problem area artificial intelligence deep learning training one key framework solve problem forefront forefront term gpu extremely term performance capability also strength overall development platform software solution working teach many different place around world use steve smigie colette kresscontinue probably consider first inning data center business move forward leaf u last one term automotive two different piece automotive business infotainment system rather mature space car see today incorporate infotainment system different degree partake premium level key graphic differentiates within car well penetrated many car see strong growth rate continued grow move forward though business change transform focus autonomous driving focusing currently road one first level 3 autonomous driving vehicle road tesla continued announce ce couple month ago term continued work audi daimler also working autonomous platform going forward still early stage know automotive industry time term getting actual design think see soon even car company focusing 2020 year term lot platform coming forth agreed different stage different type growth rate important business u great go gaming heritage still strong talk changed seemed tied pc historically know driven maybe launch platform changed term generate revenue business versus traditionally yes actually think couple year ago three four five year ago common talk overall pc market going grow order try determine overall gaming business revenue would reality actually gaming market work gamers today gamers coming board usually already pc business card market adding underlying platform improve overall performance sell time card actually selling true pc evolving business really concentrated platform term sale steve smigie colette kressbut evolution happened last couple year one really mobility mobility gamers gamers love end card give best type performance aaa production value game also coming also want mobility able essentially game anywhere taken last year exact performance get desktop mobile laptop performance seeing market really high performing overall notebook maybe 2,000 2,500 price range overall laptop enable gaming well market actually growing strong growing stronger overall desktop business continuing see move term mobility ability moving also cloud seen u ce talk geforce experience actually working streaming game whatever different type device device right might enabled gpu leveraging gpu cloud bring gaming essentially gamer pc whether already gpu involved key area evolution seen see gamers coming renew refresh using term gpu essentially coming buying greatest platform performance improves overall experience even though may exact game playing year key overall price performance continues improve even saw u last week last week launched yet another graphic card 1080 ti part market even allows 35 performance versus last highest card 1080 gaming market one area seems interesting virtual reality say recent analyst day got try think call vr funhouse made believer tried 3d tv past god awful know really believe vr tried system two 1080 card phenomenal talk little bit pr opportunity guy look point absolutely virtual reality definitely coming life last year virtual reality one key thing make successful experience performance power gpu steve smigie colette kressif want virtual reality one make look tremendously realistic need processing power overall frame rate refresh gpu overall provide come funhouse funhouse game talk content content capability continue evolve space right enabled almost every single one gaming card gaming side house eligible equally capable running vr think important next generation gaming gaming come game necessarily one position observe game type position within game think new evolution term strategy within game talking virtual reality content also continuing build tremendous amount startup well traditional gaming company focused building content early stage everything continuous play additional hardware hardware endorse content continue evolve well great wanted turn data center mentioned last quarter pretty amazing one area found getting lot attention artificial intelligence hoping could talk little bit enable generally drill little bit nvidia nvidia data center market see segmenting sure think data center business data center business actually five individual business underneath let start piece data center business 8 10 year started still key component business computing computing using gpu accelerator many supercomputer across world supercomputer focused mathematical computation essentially answer known using gpu accelerator taking work cpu enables overall workload enhanced complete sooner still business still thriving still growing well within business expanded uniquely area data center business number two focusing work term hyperscale company company like microsofts amazon google baidus facebooks focusing application see every single day use gpu ai accelerated mean think example area voice recognition natural language processing image detection video encoding thing ai enabled throwing significant amount data together deep neural network surrounding allows serve back answer answer using artificial intelligence common example would search voice search phone becoming significant percentage search command happen essentially ai problem generally used gpu behind business number two business number three focus term cloud think hyperscales case actually move cloud service provider one number one instance asked instance cloud also gpu cloud service provider building instance enterprise startup researcher use cloud access gpu rent type model begin work bigger workload different type problem facing enterprise startup see many work focused large data set creating neural network term cloud also computing cloud also may working term virtualized gpu essentially move u fourth business fourth business grid business great business focus many model one gpu many user essentially gpu sits cloud either stream information essentially carry overall workstation whole cloud virtualize application virtualize pc thing seeing business last business dgx ai supercomputer similar cloud desire get started ai term enterprise way actually get enterprise quickly providing containerized ai supercomputer versus toefl platform build case supercomputer come 8 gpus installed also come significant portion software software includes cuda development platform also support different ai framework overall development library component start right bat term dgx essentially begin lot ai work five business extremely important strongly growing across combination focusing cloud hyperscales steve smigie colette kressas far outreach also higher education enterprise many different industry focused ai great thanks artificial intelligence panel december tech conference asked whose silicon important artificial intelligence point said definitely nvidia hardware perspective also fact cuda really make work think something guy started maybe 10 year ago hoping would talk little bit given strength think incoming competition either maybe fpgas maybe amd coming gpu sure think good area focus necessarily silicon think platform much come cuda familiar development programming language born within company eight 10 year important part many teach given knowledge overall cuda eight 10 year teaching higher education well taught type forum instructor led certification reached 400,000 different developer around world taught cuda cuda essentially open also c++ like allows programmer necessarily program hardware level extract software level essentially write want hardware application essentially writing familiar software designer level overall outreach continue teach continue provide additional library different component allows gpu really key differentiation type competitor many different form factor refer acceleration could move fpga asic maybe even another gpu need understand different gpu gpu performance capability high overall performance watt also important thing keep mind downfall one ability get started actually programming ai without programming language amount work focused term framework steve smigie colette kresswe keep eye every single framework deep learning deep learning training tensorflow caffe continue find new area u focus term library help also making sure understand industry see type ai work lot focus cuda call cudnn stand deep neural net working develop neural net key component underneath deep learning also expanded learning refer deep learning institute helping people understand deep learning write deep learning type application teaching around world started last year gpu technology conference one type institute training probably year coming forward reach probably hundred thousand people trained deep learning institute well okay great maybe one minute transition within auto solution moving tegra plus gpu gpu autonomous driving maybe minute minute margin want leave couple minute question audience okay really quickly autonomous driving usually talk talked data center reason really extension work learned data center regarding deep learning ai solving problem autonomous driving onlines ai problem requiring significant amount compute process occurring around car determine step nothing term drove learned overall handbook got car actually inferring every situation enable gpu take lot work see u combination putting socs tegra brand together gpus autonomous platform going forward call drive px customized solution scalable solution depending level want driving heard level 3 level 4 type level 3 could probably completed soc term car keep mind data center automotive company dgx server also working term platform steve smigie colette kress steve smigie colette kressback data center train data eventually car well taking work drive realizing new information new data also trained back term data center also expand adding new gpu case well add additional color additional complexity problem solve move level 3 level 4 beyond scope continue work seen u talk tesla also heard u talk audi daimler term working autonomous driving platform well great got bunch new business talk u little bit think say margin profile going forward based new stuff coming sure margin whether start overall gross margin kind focus underlying part business think hardware business platform really rich term software layer allowing u provide increasing amount value deliver term product higher value allows u ability grow overall margin gross margin perspective focus development layer term r software continue expand value platform opportunity increase overall gross margin little bit change quarter renew overall intel licensing royalty agreement move forward focus still going moving expanding higher value added platform growing overall gross margin great see question audience okay great follow going forward capital done great job increasing margin getting lot growth cash seem good stuff already got anything make sense go buy think cash generated company number one focus going making sure invested appropriately steve smigie colette kressterms business going forward investment key investment growing many market talked time time area believe bolting team early growth area onto platform key focus u well another way saying rarely purchase people one one start term team may buy team people early startup always keep looking company largely organic smaller piece added going two key focus use term cash first focus term capital return process capital return important shareholder value message part business go forward great well thanks lot appreciate breakout session cordoba 3 thank thanks
