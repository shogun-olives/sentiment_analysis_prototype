okay great well pleased chris eveden nvidia come chat u bit nvidia today thanks much chris perhaps start gpus mean nvidia gpu company used nifty graphic desktop actually broader quite considerably done gpus could run sell gpus day roughly revenue breakout yes sure describe visual computing company reﬂects fact core activity say gpu wrap differently take different market take gaming market graphic driver wrap professional software driver give u quadro business professional graphic built whole ecosystem around power computing cuda platform give u tesla product built hypervisor gpu well new grid business going come four business use exact piece silicon although different price point different piece silicon different price point exact piece silicon difference value put software ecosystem put around come even tegra tegra gpu wrapped whole bunch software ecosystem also silicon well system chip tegra business david wong chris eveden david wong chris evedenbut leveraging ip got core competence like gpu look much effort put actually software engineer hardware engineer although categorized know semiconductor analyst categorized semiconductor company make decent case fact software company make gpus run software business structured term revenue let see approximately head geforce around 60 quadro around 20 tesla around 5 tegra around 15 got get 100 want get 105 probably yes well licensing stuff like always broad rule thumb look business impressive within 60 multiple speaker multiple speaker yes divide two market geforce pc product pc consumer divide market two segment call gaming oem really used think desktop notebook easy knew chip going form factor actually informative end market gaming oem actually almost gaming almost entirely desktop oem almost entirely notebook quite gaming notebook oem desktop also much informed way looking market segment different behavior gaming segment strong growing high single digit year probably whole market whole asp strong market someone buying pc play game specific need pc whereas oem business oems buying gpus really differentiate pc within marketplace oem want sell notebook make money want upsell one key cell gpu david wong chris eveden david wong chris evedenwhole market lot pressure right typically average consumer pc task better tablet something saying couple year seeing lot cannibalization lot price pressure market well competition feature might used laptop manufacturer differentiate product thing like ssd touchscreen expensive might put pressure bottom market see decline offset actually strength gaming oem market characterized large number unit low asp low gross margin well low gross margin percentage come proper contribution much smaller gaming business jeff fisher talked analyst day last week actually see big swing occasionally unit number reﬂected hardly revenue profit got base low value notebook oem part generating much profit overall think geforce business strong least ﬂat year year within look like mix going get richer excellent pushing bit gaming oems said gaming primarily profit think revenue gaming earlier yes okay great begun give u number could perhaps step give u view growth potential talked bit geforce professional graphic tesla tegra right professional let stop take really high level step one high level see geforce quadro growing slowly gdp generating awful lot cash cash returning quite lot cash shareholder moment tesla proven growth story smaller base profitable growing strongly grid option growth like lot excitement around grid early day enterprise purchase cycle really hard u say give got enough dot graph draw line right certainly promising many way tegra put take tegra automotive business strong growing strongly withdrawn mainstream smartphone business still smartphone tablet well see unfolds year look high level taking business bit detail within geforce quadro quadro 82 market share according idc unit think wallet share 90 north 90 dollar share really grow business grow market bunch initiative place suspect dominant term equation going forward least coming year likely gdp specifically manufacturing gdp since 80 sale generated cad sale cad workstation quadro tesla proven growth story grew 37 last year really broken stable 100 million year broken added support code got broader channel let give example illustrate mean 1.5 year ago sell tesla something team nvidia nvidia team would go company evangelize tesla particular application would port code guy application would sell hardware hypothetical example research johnson johnson looking protein modeling interaction large molecule know molecular dynamic code accelerated tesla know ibm sell tesla server phone ibm salesman get one delivered friday completely different 1.5 year ago knew customer many many customer know course way business scale ibm used ibm randomly particularly important partner 32 according idc worldwide installed base supercomputer twice much anybody else build supercomputer system anybody else important partner supermicro huge space nec cray dell hp pretty much data center computer data center working tesla supplying tesla product support code right across molecular dynamic code seismic code financial code modeling equation modeling derivative pricing actually something port well hardware sort application area growing really fast tesla next one grid grid described option growth grid grid let differentiate one always cause confusion tesla computer although using gpu using graphic using perform calculation good example nothing graphic pricing derivative modeling plasma something like yes nothing graphic grid data center well grid graphic grid serving graphic power remotely bunch way monetize way looking excited short term making virtual desktop environment better familiar citrix vmware make user experience better make user experience better extend application application well right install virtual desktop environment generally speaking using user interface window 95 type appearance change bring window 8 support video support say support talking quadro type application like kfir even thing like autodesk light application light fact 7 million installed seat worldwide majority even using graphic card still much virtual desktop infrastructure putting card support application want make detailed nature like business perspective hundred trial running worldwide david wong chris eveden david wong chris evedenit product cycle bit early say exactly growing lot excitement around literally think last time came 466 trial enterprise worldwide lot lot potential business tegra tegra final one talked tegra number market one predictable automotive grew strongly last year expect grow strongly year going top expect tablet win box win possibly smartphone win well generating revenue year actually look current revenue let say recent quarter expected year look tegra roughly break segment broken detail think roughly think number said publicly roughly 40 revenue automotive last year automotive actually becoming one biggest subsegments tech growth already one big multiple speaker market visual computing important actually increasing importance look advanced driver automation system strong differentiator even looking infotainment traditional market successful automotive quality pixel really starting matter really affect perception quality car know around example life barcelona mobile world congress february cab priuses digital dashboard needle dial pixel recently luckily lucky enough drive friend tesla car digital dashboard well wholly different experience right tesla one clearly dashboard inside 100,000 car prius one really brought home quality pixel impinges affect ability impression quality car david wong chris evedenanother example looking car couple year ago great car nice engine beautiful leather seat great stereo sportive handled really well everything could get fact nav system clearly badly translated japanese tainted whole experience car really believe experience bring graphically car going say much quality car leather inlaid walnut used say differentiated placed heavily strength great mean thinking various segment different application somewhat different product talk different competitor got one session gpu different one tesla let go list geforce quadro competitor amd 2/3 market share geforce said 4/5 share quadro think best chip also think term ecosystem driver feature built around chip really help u hold onto market make stickier otherwise would give better user experience really come quality user experience ecosystem software build huge part specifically couple example one geforce driver generally considered much better quality amd driver driver layer software sits fit hardware operating system huge impact performance life graphic card continually update driver thing huge impact also question putting feature game work geforce card game better gaming experience geforce physx example physic simulation run gpus built unreal engine 4 built many game going appear titanfall biggest game moment right going see feature based improves immersiveness whole gaming experience differentiate software quadro performance well also stability reliability enormous amount qualification enormous list professional application across improbably large list system configuration director want waste time supporting product need level qualification give actually competitor run list competition amd made lot noise competition market actually geforce know possibility gain share sort transactional oem business might impact number unit might see market share number much impact actually revenue much profit much smaller number think continue growing share gaming think increase revenue profit share regardless happens unit workstation business quadro market driven price market driven quality driven performance dependability stability think typical cad workstation 10,000 5000 10,000 workstation 20,000 worth software got however much engineer cost say 200,000 year whatever 400,000 year whatever number selling competitor 4000 graphic card 3000 matter help get anywhere need better product really concerned market either go list grid sorry tesla competitor tesla well two competitor intel entered market alternative wanted parallel computing currently running enormous number cpu answer give since intel launched xeon 5 first launched xeon 5 launched graphic card always said 116 graphic card might branded tesla competitor point exactly happened larrabee dead long live xeon 5 technology expected actually helped u perverse way competitor traditional xeon cpu challenge always overcome inertia would go potential customer would say hey look great thing power processing much performance per watt much raw performance better deal would reject david wongand say well wait next year intel going come much better cpu everything going get better automatically right would anything wo code reporting warned everything get faster automatically intel market well intel essentially saying thing u going move parallel point want get performance per watt running performance per watt gain xeon moved xeon 5 point question get intel go nvidia nvidia got far code ported already nvidia got massive cuda rico system training 20,000 people year program hardware intel got code ported yet make claim code run automatically xeon 5 true loyalty sense like code reported xeon 5 ordinary cpu code ported xeon 5 run xeon 5 run slowly ran cpu actually worse yes answer question run yes answer question anyone actually programming model xeon 5 actually similar programming model tesla product basically see extension essentially compile directly help compile figure bit going parallelized bit incumbent intel lot money throw problem certainly win deal would still anticipate big market would anticipate tesla continuing grow strongly market competitor tegra competitor really qualcomm automotive incumbent freescale ti know capable going moving next generation infotainment certainly hate ask qualcomm started space got lot term making lost ground term software tool ecosystem built around chip truly resource going compete strongly visual computing expertise strong differentiator strong differentiator already move next generation advanced driver automation system ada even stronger differentiation people anything like sort image processing right chris eveden q david wong chris eveden q unidentified participant chris eveden q david wong chris evedendo question audience anybody question answer went minute question u anyone well going think question could talk chris guess assumption manufacturing technology availability future also plan move finfets bit careful say future manufacturing plan competitively sensitive information moore law talked last week said moore law slowing slowed find way innovate innovation like nvlink think specific one talking fast interconnect cpu gpus well cpu/gpu gpu/gpu one example innovation move move 20 move 16 whether go hard fast typically gone new node open question see unfolds amplify favorite topic gentleman asked last week attitude intel past run nvidia saying know look mean right tsmc best best technology best commercial term fantastic fantastic partner u many many year used supplier past badly burned mean say completely blind idea actually one supplier q david wong q unidentified participant chris eveden q david wong chris evedenmight seem risk need mba wonder aloud look vendor would absolutely open looking intel samsung global foundry look quite closely one ever technology lead right commercial term would seriously consider taking least production think today tsmc best ca imagine relationship tsmc anything stronger today yesterday thanks announcement amd certainly got surely enough strengthen relationship tsmc question anyone else relative success automotive tegra versus smartphones smaller display size size display value much thing power management thing certainly bigger screen pixel driving sophisticated application driving screen fall bailiwick like think also mainstream smartphone market high level integration market quite important strong incumbent market qualcomm motive connectivity integrate make diﬃcult market anyone else break differentiating factor primarily price going diﬃcult place u compete differentiating factor visual experience note car even smartphones tablet think much better prospect market answer question cool anyone else wondering comment smartphones exited mainstream smartphones leave baseband capability still need baseband automotive connectivity going become increasingly important market keep developing q david wong chris eveden q david wong q unidentified participant chris evedenstandalone baseband voice data going develop integrated baseband application processor okay product got one target market mind mainstream smartphones taker chris see best embedded opportunity available tegra going forward well automotive obvious one predictable one paid said pipeline like 2 billion worth business next year got visibility sat hand make new business call five year time whatever number saying five year specifically would 2 billion worth revenue clearly sitting hand clearly trying go sell company great predictable significant revenue line embedded application looking suppose count box embedded application like apple tv think device like could add decent gaming well run android put decent game think would compelling device could sell similar price huge differentiation moving head around much mic finished right okay talking sorry finish question interesting example got shield right nvidia got portal running valve game game absolutely loved pc came year ago running perfectly well shield available publicly soon playing last night put console got got real gaming console experience 100 maybe 130 q david wong chris eveden q david wong chris eveden q david wong chris evedennow got gaming console extraordinary right completely change game playing playing back tv player right mean sure much extra value get add gaming capability suddenly becomes quite interesting device open android access whole android ecosystem got portal running shield got angry bird running shield got facebook app running shield got factset running shield multiple speaker factset running shield got factset android app got running shield yes maybe need shield come analyst day giving away free already talked i. oh well think webcast time anyway appreciate stopping chris always great catch nvidia thank much sure thanks david anyone question going little longer reach talk cool thank
