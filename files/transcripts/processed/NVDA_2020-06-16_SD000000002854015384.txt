six year ago 2013 annual revenue nvidia bouncing around 3.5 billion 4 billion previous five year pc chipsets accounted 1/2 business data center accounted 3 gross margin ebit margin kind struggled get 20 six year ago contrast year street modeling revenue 10 billion higher 14 billion gross margin ten point higher 60 operating margin 15 point higher critical element driven transformation nvidia yes great set fact term number overall growth seen last decade step back actually recall many time six seven year ago discussed company talking initial transformation chip company associated overall pc shipment largest overall correlation overall revenue several year discussing yes may interaction general pc specific term market chosen market saw term growing pc company pc chip company seen u today transform term gaming overall gaming platform also seen term many platform used overall computing whether server whether think role cloud computing everyday business today moved period time really getting grasp world would change computing necessity overall acceleration going market would able built chip alone focused focused 10.5 year ago also overall software important piece software begin creating ability develop ride top overall gpu stitching together many component see term platform created cuda cuda available across every single one overall gpus integral term work done expand market taken overall unified architecture company focused specifically area knew acceleration would important able expand quite fortunate right time right place using acceleration expand overall ai ai many year built area focus many scientist researcher looking ai would transform world use acceleration use deep learning build much see today ai perfect match company continue focus building superior chip innovating overall design overall chip also specific layer software support many industry also last several year realized also opportunity accelerate beyond overall gpu gpu platform seen last year focus acquisition mellanox well several piece overall computing platform look acceleration possibility speed work overall complete think careful choice careful choice overall market chosen also full look computing consider u mark lipacis colette kressplatform play system company actually look chip company okay great explanation transformation happened driver kind lead next question ecosystem privilege taking jensen roadshow five year ago one meeting asked competition said ai gpu thought zen thing say time made think importance ecosystem work found pc era wintel ecosystem captured 80 value generating pc supply chain smartphone market apple capturing 80 value smartphone supply chain question think fair say compare nvidia ecosystem like wintel ecosystem pc era apple ecosystem smartphone era fair comparison various similarity thing saw back era entering maybe entered market since overall internet boom ca full realization thing occurred time little bit different though different also underlying factor inﬂuencing see term next wave overall computing think overall nvidia matched sense microsoft intel time specific platform overall software case industry overall era ai continuing transform every single month even last three year term seeing term type workload type solution built different see hard solidify static platform take different change therefore put nvidia quite good position nvidia ability agnostic different type computing solution different cpu different software stack different middleware different component may inside data center allows u overall user ﬂexibility era ai changing mark lipacisso nothing term specific solution ai solution though overall ai allows day one thinking ai day 300 continue used solution allows expand overall workload able continue work major framework support ai allowed work almost every single provider planet every single hyperscale large small across world also focusing use gpus think a100 platform announced yet another evolution understanding people taking accelerated computing overall data center a100 built system architecture one come eight gpus together underlying baseboard allows plugged existing rapid system easy manner improve overall qualification allowing swap entire piece data center see modernization data center different piece whole mean may stack overall storage stack gpus well central area cpu form factor a100 allowing easy ability put incentive data center additionally a100 also ability elastic term type use want use accelerated computing know ai know performance computing important area workload many overall enterprise focused term data analytics focused field data science usual platform allows scale scale capability useful hyperscales hyperscales cloud instance well enterprise mean point choose leverage gpu inferencing virtualize single gpu platform seven unique instance inferencing able stitch together eight gpus together complete one large training data set well ability enterprise time purchase continue split use overall a100 across business unit across different workload see period time overall a100 continue revise different new market area another era work thinking future accelerated computing continues evolve probably different since early match seen back last 20 year term decade new world term computing colette kresswhat would consider critical element ecosystem providing customer percentage r spent thing chip design overall ecosystem think different business connection ecosystem every single one business ecosystem need address mean thinking end customer use overall application allows use overall compute underneath application put together key participant starting already overall gaming chose five ten year ago focus ecosystem focus knowing gamer coming board look overall gpu card actually coming market wanted play game ecosystem game built type game focused overall energy focus term connection partnership even brought overall ray tracing gaming two year ago first entrant well pleased term ecosystem adoption thought bringing ray tracing overall game needed starter meaning overall ecosystem would able manage bringing ray tracing market alone needed partnership underlying compute underlying hardware stitch overall together two year passed every single game engine every single game developer organization focused incorporate ray tracing overall future game put u top bar innovation really bringing overall gamers like see game realistic different type game built ray tracing really expands market type entertainment work one industry think ecosystem even importantly focus data center focus type application use accelerated computing work began computing performance computing really high computational diﬃcult data set could back ten year ago take significant amount time complete important work whether oil gas whether many medical field well term work done seen understanding use overall gpus inferring overall answer overall ai ability allow ai expand farther research and/or lab work everyday use term hyperscales well enterprise u focusing ecosystem top application could overall accelerated build application work together middleware creating ease framework attach ecosystem application mark lipacis colette kressuser think put together work essential place differentiated u many overall player market really coming market underlying chip focus large workload carefully thinking sure enough way going deployed used whether software stitched together company although may think set hardware engineer focused designing chip working fab provider term manufacturing actually part overall engineering software engineer actually overall hardware engineer work together creating base software software allow someone use one gpus work also work take place stitch overall application rewrite sometimes application work overall gpu data center side think view coding data center acceleration platform particularly ai done higher level call deep learning framework like tensorflow kera could abstract developer nvidia ecosystem effectively would make easy port software developed deep learning framework another platform one present saying investor present concern kind insulate happening yes data center field overall ai overall open source framework built essential term speeding ability create overall application specific overall industry hyperscales focused overall framework interesting significant amount work framework term compiling overall code data together allow framework work eﬃciently effectively top gpus essential underpinning overall framework right common developer understand overall stitching together actually encourage thought focus core competency term working application data solve overall problem able leverage gpu take workload workload great mark lipacisbut necessarily easy lift switch piece see overall framework well framework cuda middleware together thing updated often overall current discussion term happening framework interesting articulated top framework today three year ago different set continue make sure aligned current overall framework well current form use three year ago would talking image detection image categorization would important use certain overall framework looking right hot overall workload focus conversational ai focus recommendator engine different overall framework different model built overall process natural language understanding combination two together represent 50 type load workload done anybody looking take something built six month ago put different type platform chip actually yesterday year thing moving ever fast new form ai building larger bigger data set amount work changed overall framework well underlying cuda software every single day changing really looking people past going keep speed seeing term adoption ai helpful think another another kind debate come investor competitive standpoint investor think could disrupt nvidia could disruptive question general purpose versus computing one past analyst day jensen made case past computing era era dominated general purpose computing platform became de facto standard opposed one nvidia gpu accelerating computing platform best positioned dominate programmable qualified kind purpose computing platform idea side argument seems legitimate compute cycle consolidating seven like seven large cloud service provider let say csps massive economy scale like end user computing industry past consolidate centralize specific workload benefit computing model building custom processor merchant processor colette kressso question think general purpose computing model dominated past apply today yes really interesting question super interesting look history history happened also look nvidia excelled overall period general purpose computing think important perspective say ability u lead adoption lead inherit number researcher number developer platform general purpose nature right reached point 1.8 million overall developer overall platform done congregated toward overall nvidia gpu platform universal use yes lot different hyperscales lot different type platform know program equally across overall software set allows ability general purpose important demonstrate overall developer researcher continue expand workload want go led u developer choose application use overall platform rather way around developer base extremely important link together many application knew well understanding overall importance accelerated computing era moore law going fall become obsolete use developer overall thinking work need done creative application allows u leverage model invest spend time even think world right lot hyperscales great hyperscales think would ability build custom overall infrastructure reality always core competency know full house overall engineer understand base chip design overall aspect building thermal different us case improve performance gpu turned u create universal capability use gpu may specific workload may use custom chip mark lipacis colette kressbut serving universe developer universal platform also universal development platform essential breadth type workload seeing would capable anybody show application specific would invest tremendously house era kept thing open possible agnostic possible support growth ai computing many workload see future field work indicates nvidia account 85 acceleration instance market top cloud service provider time amazon developing chip inferentia market data suggests around 1 instance available 2 google tpu 1 instance available mind kind biggest risk potential solution consume acceleration cycle market solution customer data get public market instance available competitive intelligence telling internal workload think biggest customer think share equal external workload instance yes evolving era type work type workload done overall hyperscales big part growth overall ai overall hyperscales first set customer many find opportunity try ability create custom workload seen correct small share one main reason work done custom custom asic focused term design process design something specific workload seeing speed market bringing overall custom asic may good maybe reasonable amount time keep mind trend overall asic come ability go back revise overall chip revise change term overall workload need relatively confident term type workload able used even think overall a100 many year making developing architecture probably quite big surprise overall mark lipacisindustry a100 three year 20x improvement performance versus last generation v100 core competency working top performance top performance speed feed top performance many different workload talked ability overall tensor core really think ﬂoating point precision necessary inferencing dial depending type workload would continue gravitate people using overall gpus large percentage workload versus using overall custom asic believe also ability whether enterprise overall cloud user use gpus cloud instance also importance edge instance talked aws google focused captive space versus overall gpu serve large market believe exist edge important everything hyperscales everything term cloud incident platform scalable edge different type workload exist important piece people continued choose overall nvidia well nvidia gpus case time time see custom asic oftentimes captive probably focused specific overall workload overall speed adoption ai growth focus people gravitate platform scale growth seeing market yes want kind pick point ampere think think solution evolved platform time involved initial product maybe let say five six year ago seem well suited training came product seem focused inferencing ampere solution seems seems optimized given scalability standpoint seems like solution fit completely idea offering general purpose acceleration platform training inferencing two question ampere right way think fit general purpose computing model end day pick time three five year ten year chip inferencing offer inferencing performance training performance solution go away solution go away end single acceleration platform one colette kresssolution yes really really important understanding entered overall inferencing market let go back term couple year ago discussed size opportunity front u data center size front u incorporated training computing two area quite leadership position also discussion importance overall inferencing lot people discus say wait minute people move overall gpu people use cpu inferencing going need different form factor going need smaller going need focus term wattage otherwise know cpu fine took piece important understanding inferencing would change changed last couple year thought term working many customer type inferencing historically really based type compute said well compute therefore create inferencing support mean rather overall simplistic type inferencing mass amount data binary type response necessary saw output training output training ai would create phenomenal overall data set new information coming would need go overall inferencing model standard overall compute chip would likely slow respond back overall need overall inferencing workload see right conversational ai example phenomenal ai workload ai workload taking one challenging part overall understanding data understanding natural language understanding natural language said deciphering term piece meaning also able respond language well conversational manner take training also therefore take inferencing side speed performance important ability speak multiple language overall workload looking couple hundred millisecond type response entrance inferencing extension saw term training built inferencing solidly percent overall data center business couple year growing doubling last quarter ability bring something like a100 market allows u overall customer mark lipacis colette kresschoosing purchase workload want allow continuation building training model move overall inferencing go forward going hard u determine specifically model much overall inferencing workload selling ability overall a100 meet multiple need end customer whether hyperscale enterprise enterprise edge well mean everything moving forward would a100 type platform believe overall acceleration meet many different type application server going forward someday way future almost everything accelerated period time may still different form factor outside a100 keep mind a100 platform also sell full system full system dgxs ability score competency focus infrastructure get configuration allows focus application focus work overall core competency similarly may opposite may say provide specific overall gpu specific workload term overall volume see market play term think full host different platform solution everything look like a100 okay clear want shift gear little bit going macro front china recent trade tension u.s. china impacted nvidia business big china consumption market risk u.s. government determines nvidia gpus enabling something deemed politically unacceptable block shipment nvidia product china yes let first start china whole customer nvidia china important customer u whole significant overall gaming business rest overall business overall gaming business pc platform pc platform integral part china household many overall workload across overall nation mean kind stem back universal nature people leveraged overall pc much work overall mark lipacis colette kressconsumer user also important piece term overall business early start high end type gaming using overall pc platform pc platform become important probably built upon platform people use overall writing overall game keep mind statement say universal platform going area world underlying gpu inside pc and/or laptop geared specific overall workload lead u see term data center data center also worked overall hyperscales many tier 2 internet provider consumer internet provider china nature u.s. u.s. hyperscales much larger overall capex budget see china important part important part universal platform also term data center use acceleration tension u.s. china continue go back forth industry understanding specific overall nvidia similar memory supplier and/or type part term consuming overall computing would overall affected stand watch say nothing overall gpus specific regarding u.s. china compute whole watch carefully part watch overall industry leader well focus far use really universal compute overall nation able continue sell overall china exception specific overall entity u.s. government concerned make sure following u.s. law regarding selling overall entity list think helpful think related question china tsmc critical supplier nvidia political situation developed nvidia blocked using tsmc nvidia wafer foundry contingency plan yes several year ago probably five year ago path creating multiple foundry multiple foundry manufacturer important u important u enterprise risk standpoint enterprise risk say oftentimes many different part world global condition change whether weather condition geopolitical thing change and/or basic oversupply demand many change mark lipacis colette kressour thought creating another foundry important part keep mind overnight decision something could put place quickly year dual overall fab support model use tsmc also use samsung many case take architecture work term development architecture fabs could choose split architecture across fabs singly one overall fab provider clear tsmc great partner u since beginning time truly appreciate partnership partnership focused machine ability spit chip really understanding process work pleased also built samsung similar different partnership different process relates overall samsung look forward like ability overall two fabs also continue support something may pulling tsmc overall fab well supportive excited see next term model today high end high end type chip complexity chip extremely pleased two fab provider excellent coming end time hoping sneak one question investor speak really focus data center data center market historically lumpy one 2018 kind shift shift trend line data center business declined dramatically first half talked good visibility july quarter talk like october quarter give u framework like next quarter visibility start kick risk shifting trend line kind reset due natural lumpiness market yes past probably talked quite bit last five year people wanted know reach seasonality data center reach seasonality assure growth see continue quarter quarter nothing guarantee sequential overall growth done pretty phenomenal job almost consistently growth correct period overall digestion digestion industry even digestion important era people wanted know well going get back growth era time u focus engineer continuing expand partnership customer base incorporate work knew enterprise working growth saw term add sit right end q1 hyperscales originally three four year ago probably majority lion share overall data center business le overall 50 overall business data center interesting side enterprise research performance computing supercomputing 50 business work term building breadth depth type workload using acceleration customer hopefully able see something smoother right keep mind still stack project project business model building inventory and/or customer inventory specific project great period time seen project per customer one project sometimes overlapping time frame term deployment customer well u would like improve overall planning planning data center hard know ineﬃciencies know ineﬃciencies term working working clearly work road map deploy data center ramping a100 right couple month got long trajectory year term deployed even quarter launch a100 reached record level v100 record level t4 even though market couple year period time see u selling a100 also see u continue selling v100 selling overall specific inferencing product t4 look continue try work visibility visibility q2 solid similar visibility term q1 turn corner get closer q3 talk visibility think important step back look say a100 going u know done everything coming overall architecture mark lipacis colette kress mark lipacisso great thing see think pleased performance company started today call overall decision area focus knowing ai accelerated computing still top priority customer unique time industry world whole think put u great place move second half time going wait get second half discus overall outlook okay fair
