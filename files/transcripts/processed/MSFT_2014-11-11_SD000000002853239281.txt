name ross macmillan rbc capital market delighted welcome vikas mehta finance director also member investor relation team microsoft know wanted make introductory remark multiple speaker yes first like thank phenomenal opportunity privilege thrilled talk financial analyst investor begin wanted remind everyone may making statement may subject risk uncertainty please review security filing describe risk uncertainty begin question answer great one thing maybe le vikas actually finance manager right start origination azure business oﬃce 365 business actually wanted start business become really important microsoft story last year let start azure first starting full program think key kind early decision microsoft made around strategy proven important success business vikas mehta ross macmillan vikas mehta yes think inaudible azure oﬃce 365 cloud business phenomenal success right fact seeing phenomenal user adoption well increase user driving consistent revenue growth look back lot success right stem back early decision took early bet made cloud think azure launched azure february 2010 almost five year back time industry analyst competitor thought move would cannibalistic revenue would dilutive earnings however firmly believed tectonic shift way shift similar proportion saw pc revolution knew would matching scenario overall would accretive business say biggest boldest thing embraced cloud meant massive global feel theme cloud challenging number reason business model predominantly software license business shifting make fundamentally model secondly investing million dollar capital expenditure meant number new thing u say learned number important lesson first infused whole cloud dna everything whether engineering agility whether robust supply chain operation misstep along way quickly recovered see term lot success stem back early decision say easy big cloud player might try take way live build infrastructure time success come one thing struck stepped outside normal boundary comfortable microsoft supporting alternative operating system like linux example inaudible oracle support oracle database microsoft environment come realization sort open player opposed playing microsoft set yes azure strategy evolved time started platform service offering azure time expanded vision make cloud boundary limit mean said going address different customer segment whether enterprise whether charge whether lee enable build application across operating system across data set across language framework enable used device operating system essentially ross macmillan vikas mehtabased new vision steve president group think took three major step direction first one make easy enterprise onboard cloud introduction well build lot hybrid capability platform second regard across board said multiple layer whether adding linux mix addition window fact 20 azure run linux added lot different database addition sql server bring oracle database ibm db2 even database like mongo cassandra well hadoop even language framework addition .net java open source language like php python know extends device o also third important thing aggressive term partnership extended way big player like oracle sap ibm salesforce player like cloudera hortonworks core o well docker fix make sure give customer choice knew enterprise run heterogeneous environment order u provide cio say evolution something made u successful important microsoft time big scale web scale application like bing example think player come enterprise software heritage trying think cloud necessarily first party web scale application experience important evolution azure saw today yes application definitely big structural advantage u think fundamentally way think infrastructure isolation application look back history launched window server 90 real power came application like sql server exchange sharepoint lync every iteration feedback loop got better better able create good robust operating system hold true azure reinventing infrastructure modern application need turn everyone else also need think application 200 web service microsoft diverse honest skill make u see robust platform ross macmillan vikas mehta ross macmillan vikas mehtalet give example think xbox skype million subscriber actively engaging platform hand asset like bing onedrive store petabyte data diverse set workload also mean way cpu simulation gaming xbox live productivity oﬃce 365 applied machine learning bing able learn application given u phenomenal learning ground better attack platform use virtual cycle take learning third party bring eﬃciency application competitor public cloud infrastructure necessarily legacy software way microsoft bit unique position use web scale application service got legacy base sort know legacy guess encompasses application make microsoft unique today sort strategy way sell cio/cco value prop absolutely know think strategy three key pillar first one hyper scale infrastructure second hybrid strength third service think traditional player typically invested data center scale done 19 region across world even bigger amazon google provide player hyper scale also provide consistency across cloud fact hybrid perspective workload window server easily move service provider cloud public cloud essentially give good portability finally aspect service think internet scale provider like google amazon actually hyper scale sure come providing hybrid service rich deep expertise around area feel pretty good competitive position back started made decision go cloud felt would cannibalistic lot would additive think seen last year look way report commercial license growing still commercial cloud business growing obviously rapidly important piece commercial license business still growing sustainable mean guess question get lot point actually cannibalize ross macmillan vikas mehtano think good question say kept historical tectonic shift happened whether said pc revolution virtualization lot consolidation happened lot shift destruction happened key point drove lot productivity came increased spend think spend percentage gdp different revolution gone see feel theme cloud disruption feel maximal scenario cloud creates possible earlier world would help cloud accretive rather cannibalistic overall business see scenario example machine learning big data analytics etcetera fact u feel creates three time opportunity overall spend share perspective versus played prior world important aspect shift enterprise private cloud public cloud happen switch go situation first get hybrid deployment learn checked cloud reliability availability feature make switch seeing right make switch revenue customer getting bigger bigger essentially enterprise spending stack side well cloud side long term feel cloud creates newer opportunity u feel really good position right financial characteristic guess margin specifically simplistically think way think provisioning basic element infrastructure like use storage fairly monetized business least pricing dynamic suggest seem ratchet rapidly whereas move scale advanced application area perhaps margin structure little better could help u frame think transition may may impact margin maybe margin question much profit contribution yes think probably right way look gross margin dollar shift cloud let give framework think think three key pillar first one core infrastructure capability essentially drive adoption platform second regard hybrid giving enterprise way cloud third service essentially differentiate ross macmillan q unidentified participant ross macmillan vikas mehtaso think core infrastructure capability providing core infrastructure capability actually help bootstrap lot high level service discount core infrastructure capability actually important especially land expand kind motion see lot storage example sort provider choice storage see newer scenario higher level service use top example big data analytics machine learning even tiered storage tiered cloud storage store simple appliance see lot different area second important aspect like point sometimes computing storage categorized commodity differentiate pillar also premium storage offering well premium compute offering high performance compute well source simple storage appliance differentiated help u monetize batch level hybrid spend extremely important second point provide differentiation easier charge premium consistency common tool provide finally higher level service absolutely go stack whether application whether differentiated provide infrastructure capability give edge others service like medium service machine learning mobility service premium service overall say mix really critical time core infrastructure capability drive adoption also extremely important quickly end saying healthy mixture 60 customer using higher level service want open question question audience happy take one inaudible let repeat question question level investment support growth cloud business given growth yes think great question go back first question term challenge face shifted business model business spending billion dollar raise build data center ross macmillan q unidentified participant vikas mehta ross macmillan q unidentified participant ross macmillanand even expand capacity number reason reason differentiator u company one strong balance sheet second application mentioning earlier help u drive initial utilization tier adoption scale definitely business three player see able sustain level investment u google amazon said feel really good hybrid plan well hyper scale ability invest main infrastructure get one back first inaudible yes think great question say objective create unique complete comprehensive cloud offering cater essentially different scenario well different customer segment big initiative u seen great adoption across board healthy diverse set workload example 20 azure linux staggering considering predominantly window based operating system even started azure secondly say customer segmenting perspective quite diverse mix 40 revenue come isvs enterprise agreement driving pretty healthy mix course enterprise definitely area strength mentioned vantage point definitely securing fact 57 fortune 500 us azure know invests azure feel pretty good overall spend platform yes inaudible question recently seen spend inaudible well positioned microsoft capture aggregate budget vikas mehta ross macmillan q unidentified participant ross macmillan vikas mehta think look holistic perspective time see vision really disrupts creates lot opportunity think newer scenario even something could imagine prior inaudible see thing way example farming company know company people involved farming use internet thing cloud technology understand trend need invest term future agriculture investment cycle way industry like hospitality banking scenario possible earlier definitely feel new scenario going expand tam think area interest big data catching really fast internet thing definitely growing see result also growing side well cloud second level really important growing fast versus competitor say still feel trend really healthy inherent strength grow start cloud overall long term cloud big opportunity area u back inaudible repeat question window annuity business big become time yes well good question say look overall annuity mix enterprise business kept growing time people shifting transactional annuity roadmap stronger roadmap quicker iteration make term pace innovation comfortable customer term betting seen across board going back question specifically window big business u last said 4 billion business u rightly pointed growing double digit say investment term roadmap come quick iteration keep raising ross macmillan q unidentified participant vikas mehta ross macmillan vikas mehta ross macmillanthe bar term enterprise feature customer feel comfortable investing point say window 10 focus heavily enterprise feature catering lot important scenario enterprise feel pretty good volume licensing business window side right inaudible yes yes think go back earlier point made regard hyper scale infrastructure time able differentiate give u unique balance lot company think amazon specifically even google matter good application ability create hyper scale infrastructure time pas benefit back customer price etcetera unique position application diverse scale hence also ability difference hybrid strength well different theatre term long heritage service give example example even think gartner magic quadrant leadership said credited four category infrastructure service platform service x86 virtualization cloud storage amazon two google believe none hyper scale critical important able differentiate provide comprehensive cloud platform know unique u perspective run time thank much vikas great great time thanks lot ross thanks
