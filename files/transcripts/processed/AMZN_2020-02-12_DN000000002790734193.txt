great thank go ahead get started name heath terry lead tmt research goldman sachs goldman sachs employee special point pride last three year first roy joseph david solomon took center stage aws invent opening keynote front 50,000 people audience every invent conference particular point pride introduce andy jassy chief executive oﬃcer amazon web service andy joined amazon 1997 straight business school 2003 led team founding aws creating world undisputed leader cloud computing company inside amazon worth according math well 0.5 trillion andy joined conversation goldman sachs ceo david solomon andy david welcome good afternoon everyone andy thank got lot easier start invent made actually work put stage dj keynote quite good way people still talking set well mean 07:45 morning easy dj 10,000 people david m. solomon andrew r. jassyyou good energy 07:45 multiple speaker try best let dive right amazon 22 year founded aws little 50 people 2003 going generate 45 billion revenue business year half company profit put financials aside start think scale built kind quantify u little bit scale aws fast continues grow well kind amazing adventure business 40 billion revenue run rate growing 34 million active customer define entity use platform last 30 day really broad diverse group early day aws mostly building business scratch top aws company like slack instagram pinterest stripe robinhood company like happened last half dozen year enterprise public sector rapidly adopted aws cloud see every imaginable vertical business segment using cloud financial service work goldman capital one intuit commonwealth bank australia healthcare johnson johnson merck pfizer myers squibb manufacturing ge shire electric philip seems every imaginable vertical business segment using cloud meaningful way public sector 6,500 government agency worldwide 11,000 academic institution 29,000 broad fast growing customer base looking revenue trillion request get various service time little hard able track everybody relative market segment share one really publish full metric pretty significant market segment leadership share really kind see breadth look everyday life look ride sharing use lyft uber ola india grab southeast asia mytaxi europe running aws cloud use medium service netﬂix run completely aws obviously amazon prime disney+ watch super bowl watch streaming fox live top aws use peloton use son big orderer food postmates grubhub doordash pervasive impact every day life yet always say really strongly believe still early day people moving cloud even though business growing fast reasonable size think going different 10 year david m. solomon andrew r. jassy yeah one thing fascinating see big business significant innovation large organization mean time amazon much bigger large organization big innovation advice think actually advice would give goldman sachs trying innovate business advice would give larger company around innovating building new business line inside strong organization yeah well thing thing helpful u think necessarily mean helpful everybody think generally useful principle first hire people want build disproportionately index hiring builder think builder people like invent people look different customer experience honest working try reinvent customer experience people really understand launch starting line finish line many great people technology love get launch lose interest really rarely catch lightning bottle keep listening customer iterating got hire right type builder think got organize team allow move quickly think one important thing aws early day natural place build aws would infrastructure team leveraged data center network instead pulled completely group people run consumer business scale every day new business always lose existing surer bet making sure organize separable autonomous team destiny burdened run core business running every day got give team right building block able move really quickly think one interesting thing amazon last 10 year unbelievably quickly consumer business moved would tell big piece able use aws building block external customer use need culture encourages innovation sound fairly obvious like everybody want encourage new thing think lot big company especially get bigger senior people walking meeting hearing new idea looking way say ill willed get conservative seems harder imagine successful something new hard think one team effort manage would say opposite really true amazon senior leader tell favorite meeting one listen new idea say yes everything say yes lot spend energy meeting trying problem solve team david m. solomon andrew r. jassy david m. solomonto get yes think last thing going invent especially significant existing business success willing tolerate failure hire great people people sometimes weird dichotomy think amazon lot type people hate fail yet pushing envelope going get right time always found launch phone culturally reaﬃrming may known launched phone exactly work yet like input output work input team hired plan built customer conversation technology built timing liked input even though work took learning technology could reuse reapplied gave people good landing spot great people fear working new thing worry wo spot work really good point talked said early lot adoption go first inning second inning mean early would say maybe two out bottom first runner board run side though think look total global spend 3 cloud moving fast growing fast think strong opinion really seen play faster imagined fullness time know 10 year 15 year 20 year company data center much smaller footprint workload worth moving going leave mainframe die something close something like factory latency wise moving cloud early day think people make move make move choose time modernize lot older software look lot lot customer moving away mainframe lot customer moving away older guard commercial grade database thing like aurora lot folk moving quickly modernizing window linux see type move also see huge explosion saas provider building product really organically right top cloud different world still early day talked thing obviously changing move bottom first two men move towards ninth else change look get closer ninth inning besides change mentioned else see andrew r. jassy david m. solomon andrew r. jassy yeah think whatever worth sure get ninth inning lifetime working think period unbelievably fast growth think changed 14 year since aws launched pace change really rapid think next 14 year going even rapid think look like think company wo data center think see compute done model think generation developer choose programming model think cluster server think see different play regard people use database relational side people moving away lot expensive proprietary punitive old guard provider also increasingly company use one relational database satisfy database need use database see people using thing like key value store cash database craft database time series database database different almost every application machine learning ai infused billion maybe trillion device live everywhere oﬃces home factory car plane ship oil field agricultural field device going collecting data sending cloud analytics sending smarter action back device productive lot task human today kind mundane task done robotics application human focus higher level activity mean kind way different also optimistic future quantum computing play role well let shift talk artificial intelligence little bit know huge area innovation spending lot time think 10,000 people working alexa alone talk little bit kind vision direction ai play going forward context something like alexa context talking broadly let talk little bit impact ai yeah think working ai machine learning 20 year amazon kind see everywhere business recommendation see retail side fueled machine learning look pick path people fulfillment center use go get product box used machine learning algorithm look prime air drone effort look amazon go computer vision algorithm drive look alexa obviously long time deeply embedded business capability yet still ton idea david m. solomonnow today many machine learning ai expert practitioner lot exist live kind big technology company trying think collectively getting educated part aws lot service capability building enable company take advantage promise see kind three macro layer stack bottom layer expert machine learning practitioner many world people comfortable building model picking algorithm training model tuning model deploying keep running model become stale provide lot way use popular framework build chip make faster training inference prediction thing like many expert machine learning practitioner important thing feel like done make much accessible every enterprise build middle layer stack built service called sagemaker enables every day developer data scientist much easily build train tune deploy machine learning algorithm fraction time mean look intuit train fraud model le week used take six month big difference top layer stack people want build model actually want plug model built get answer back application programming interface call api call thing like text turn speech audio transcribe text take text translate lot language take transcribed translated text tell read let natural language processing help internal search internet try search internet pretty lousy company use natural language understanding natural language processing change help u give u personalization algorithm give u forecasting algorithm service top layer company really hungry plug model company scale data think company operate three layer stack would argue middle layer maybe single important enterprise much data want use predictive algorithm get value transition talking requires significant investment one thing see obvious got build something new go build apple card build cloud looking legacy thinking upgrading moving forward massive investment necessary talk investment board big company founder business people running big business talk andrew r. jassyinvestment way motivates people make investment quicker move along faster really good question really relevant right stage adoption enterprise public sector feel like early stage meat enterprise public sector adoption think almost always conversation starter discussion cost company turn capital expense lay server data center variable expense pay consume attractive get turn variable expense something lower large scale pas form lower price lowered price 75 different occasion last eight year largely competitive absence competitive pressure dna inside amazon relentlessly work take cost give back customer form lower price turn capex variable expense lower variable expense could get real elasticity instead decide much infrastructure provision either provision little outage exceed nobody everyone provision peak reason call peak sit wasted capital cloud provision need turn need pay scale seamlessly need anymore give back stop paying cost different cloud existed compelling virtually every company number one reason enterprise public sector organization moving cloud agility speed ability innovate much rapid clip unless operate business segment competition people move quickly people inventing rapid rate also competitor adopting cloud two compelling reason board leadership team want move think think really get dime get going lot challenge turn technical spend lot time talking technical piece pretty trackable lot challenge frankly leadership first thing really happen senior leadership team decide really want move conviction inertia really powerful thing inside organization often people middle organization excited moving others may know mean job scope proud built senior leadership team truly convicted moving set aggressive top goal force organization move faster otherwise would favorite example maybe ge making decision really wanted move cloud cio time jamie miller decided going move 30 50 application aws 30 day got david m. solomon andrew r. jassytechnology leader together said said 45 minute told dopey would work make sense said listened said heard going let go go 42 application 30 day process learnt compliance model governance model security model success idea started rolling could set second really aggressive goal top move 7,000 application aws year senior level conviction aggressive top goal force org move mean business really easy dip toe water several year wake realize competitor far away good point talk competitive landscape talk competitive landscape cloud computing yeah think every major technology company either trying build kind replica aws built cloud computing infrastructure space working aws since start market 14 year working guess 16.5 year many big surprise lot big surprise probably single biggest one long took large technology company build something looked like aws trying trying get launch without anybody knowing time amazon really thought retailer felt like get market first harder u successful seattle pretty small city know lot people side lake trying get launch without anybody knowing never imagined six seven year head start significant market segment leadership share point think reason think first thing lot functionality part started earlier part innovating faster clip really turn matter trying migrate existing application premise cloud want unleash builder build anything imagine right tool right job save time money much larger ecosystem partner thousand system integrator helping enterprise move cloud isps saas provider adapt software work technology infrastructure platform two three start aws leadership position get move cloud lot software used using want use david m. solomon andrew r. jassy david m. solomon andrew r. jassyand think maturity platform pretty different spot expression use internally compression algorithm experience ca learn certain lesson get different elbow curve scale business couple time larger next provider combined learn lesson scale much earlier stage way ca always convince builder worry early day business used argument whether releasing something whether going one billion chance would error whether okay look scale hundred trillion dice roll point shortcut getting get scale change think architecture infrastructure yeah amazon broadly initiative across range industry range business time see business create channel conﬂict trying way competitor push push around working deal issue would work better ecosystem inside amazon would work better ecosystem outside amazon aws yeah well surprisingly number conversation topic always share get chance speak customer really two existing significant industry amazon disrupted one retail technology infrastructure case model pretty antiquated customer happy model somebody going end reinventing case turned u would also say look company space actually really great lesson u people come try new thing area company listen customer cared watched reacting adjusted done quite well new era one poopooed wished away dissed spend resource struggling think great business great customer experience simply somebody else enters space mean going kind business decline listening customer right adjusting inspired whatever new think also david m. solomon andrew r. jassysometimes people folklore mythology around amazon launch business certain area mean business area going successful seen think thing working healthcare space think lot healthcare company lot success mentioned launched something phone space seem much impact leader phone space thing payment space paypal seems quite well segment large room several company successful good job customer keep evolving fine think look hard u build business sustain long period time mean look company lasted mean guy exception looking company lasted 50 year let alone 100 year successful hard number one thing far give chance successful long term good feedback loop customer know care technology platform allows builder keep evolving business customer experience quickly need platform allows easily long shot aws usually talk talk thing people usually find reason yeah got incredibly diverse set customer platform fortune 500 company thousand company also government agency relationship technology company government getting increasingly complicated lot scrutiny broad question think government role regulating technology technology continues expand infiltrate business broadly yeah good question think keep remembering technology continue completely change life customer experience communicate one another really almost everything vast majority great people way use technology irresponsible impact people civil liberty law people use technology irresponsible unlawful way held accountable yet would say ban technology could used irresponsibly mean think look evil thing done computer server year look sony hack year ago imagine world would like allow people use computer server would radically different world think ban technology could used irresponsibly think hold party use technology irresponsibly accountable provider david m. solomon andrew r. jassy david m. solomon andrew r. jassyourselves included term service suspend people right use technology using unlawfully way impact people civil liberty number people wanted go want clarity want delineation regimentation want government actually regulate case technology used supportive eager work government agency want think important government really thoughtful targeted trying protect ca get value technology lot people complicated mean hard argue would benefit certain area better clear framework history regulation generally responding something say go far squelch opportunity agree got swing back way shape form information security got big focus aws big focus everywhere think information security aws building culture around well way build culture around anything pick thing important culture lot mechanism reinforce u security unquestionably number one priority drop everything feel like something need buttress think everybody organization senior leader people organization understand number weekly biweekly monthly mechanism involved working thinking figuring area customer want u u unquestionably number one priority number mechanism build back number thing customer want u expect u ask u prioritize early day aws lot certification people wanted want u iso compliant pci compliant hipaa compliant fedramp complaint lot certification pursued kind monitoring protection infrastructure identity access management people able secure want use time location way authentication web application firewall way know kind david m. solomon andrew r. jassyanomalous data movement unusual access account mean kind service continue build would say early day aws first maybe six seven year business biggest blocker u enterprise security problem security aws people data matter also number one priority nervous would often say well tell worried regard security cloud say well worried going lose control data would say well know aws decide data go move unless want move look like blob u encrypt motion rest say okay say well ca go touch iron say well often go touch iron data center go data center like know touching lot time think took time see customer use use securely understand feature capability would say last five six year security one single important seller people using cloud think people come away looking deeply security believing secure posture aws would premise company made big commitment climate change data center obviously meaningful consumer energy water balance challenge cost growth thinking sustainable future well think mean climate always obviously important think increasingly last year crisis deepens think big reason made climate pledge several week ago month ago company size diversity business easy mean said 80 renewable energy 2024 100 renewable energy 2030 net zero carbon 2040 10 year ahead paris agreement look scale amazon diversity business lot harder company think going require sure expensive think way think much expensive rest world get behind fix different world kid grandkids requires lot invention much going invention lot also partner one reason decided public climate pledge early really wanted incent hopefully inspire company invent space going need partner u going need david m. solomon andrew r. jassypartners make happen important priority data center space cloud computing space think sometimes people forget cloud computing significantly inherently energy eﬃcient data center large part utilization much higher like look 451 research study found running aws 3.6 time energy eﬃcient running average data center look carbon intensity side electricity consumed renewables purchased run task aws 88 carbon eﬃcient would cloud much environmentally friendly construct data center company utilized 10 20 still lot continue energy eﬃcient got kind invention around use water thoughtfully scarce way 70 renewable project funded inside amazon 1,900 megawatt power generating lot lot area investing innovation resource great great finish one challenge business scale operating spade attracting people retaining people help make possible thinking people management talent scale operating really good question course devil detail thing amazon almost 23 year point obviously drank kind remarkable many people company long mean long u around year mean look aws person run product development almost 22 year person run infrastructure almost 22 year person run demand generation 14 year kind almost naturally strong retention people think big piece lot focus think keep people hungry motivated excited working amazon long period time intentional culture going prioritize want u mentioned earlier disproportionately index hiring builder want company think builder technologist people unbelievable operator inventive operation change way think able get something done cost structure time frame take get thing done want builder everything try culture everything talk senior leadership team build type company type culture allow builder build thing talk process david m. solomon andrew r. jassy david m. solomondo like bureaucracy might see creeping lot want knock want make world best place builder build think really place like amazon builder spend time trying figure yeah appreciate andy really great come spend time group today appreciate thought thanks u appreciate thank absolutely thanks lot
