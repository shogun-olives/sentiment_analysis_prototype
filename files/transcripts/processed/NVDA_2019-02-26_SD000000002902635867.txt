right good morning everybody joe moore happy today colette kress chief financial oﬃcer nvidia start let read disclosure really quickly please note important disclosure including personal holding disclosure morgan stanley disclosure appear morgan stanley public website www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures registration desk question answer colette thank much definitely lot going guy always maybe could start gaming kind go right gaming 53 revenue pretty exciting product launch little bit inventory correction around talked business sort peaked 1.8 billion 1 billion last quarter kind talk happening maybe could frame term said consumption level sure finished q4 result fiscal year probably ended little bit differently hoped end overall year took opportunity kind describe dynamic saw term gaming throughout year think move new fiscal year one part sat back looked essentially past first cryptocurrency wave ended essentially end q1 last year went looked saw q2 q3 q4 well guiding term q1 averaged period time take look term think q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kress q joseph lawrence mooreoverall gaming business overall gaming demand period time probably shipped higher overall underlying demand q2 q3 last year however q4 q1 going reverse going say going ship le believe overall demand end market happening term gaming period time though average came together considered baseline overall gaming business approximately 1.4 billion expect grow going forward period time last 1.5 quarter opportunity launch new wave overall turing architecture turing architecture opportunity u bring ray tracing overall gaming business important part u making sure healthy channel channel absorb new product well important part think set drive within fiscal year okay 1.4 billion kind trailing rate consumption grow time catch right okay make sense talk little bit got much inventory know mentioned crypto certainly shortage around seemed like guy described oem business largely serving crypto much gaming number actually bore look hash rate cryptocurrencies seem like much incremental gaming shortage created incremental demand channel fill think inventory got big yes cryptocurrency wave ended quite sharply end q1 year ago little bit q2 happened overall wave extended higher price overall channel higher overall manufacturer suggested retail price period therefore inﬂuenced underlying demand people first channel kept price little bit higher really bring back fast enough u track overall demand period demand therefore le expected led u higher overall excess inventory channel period time great want talk important new product maybe inventory discussion talk 1660 launched last week pretty compelling kind product colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kressjuxtapose everything else going older 1060 product newer 2060 product yes excess inventory channel expected take approximately 1 2 quarter get expect end quarter today depleted overall excess inventory channel pascal inaudible enabled u start new term turing architecture different price point attract area well ce announced 2060 2060 price point 350 great overall price realize overall ray tracing overall gaming commented announced also 1660 ti come price point 279 also great performance improvement pascal probably 35 even widely increased term performance maxwell key important volume skus attract market north america also term china excited bring turing stack great price point okay guess look april quarter guidance understanding product guess people asked `` guidance conservative given product kind price point even development product every level maybe inventory 1060 hurt much respond obviously knew gave guidance yes looked overall guidance need keep mind still work overall inventory channel slight overlap dove new turing product know still period time allow overall occur start selling overall channel believe given q1 guidance little bit lower overall base overall run rate definitely inﬂuences overall year overall growth think start stepping back finish q term growth term latter half year well okay great maybe talk little turing new capability ray tracing kind technology really exciting prospect talk importance obviously bring something breakthrough capability market really programmed optimal usage see term enthusiasm developer well q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kressray tracing overall turing architecture super super opportunity believe gaming gaming probably expected hit 10 year future bringing based overall performance availability established overall platform opportunity essentially change essentially people absorb overall gaming cinematic type overall game picture true real term seeing correct little bit chicken egg hardware overall architecture software enables overall ray tracing brings overall content area great set game already come including battlefield v including anthem really using dl well term metro exodus also available see game future come take advantage overall ray tracing breakthrough technology similar see term programmable shading 10 year ago see future go forward great thank getting signal people ca hear could turn mics little louder would great aspect turing guess get ray tracing support mentioned dl deep learning talk seems like go long way really boosting performance ray tracing product even start implement ray tracing correct overall ray tracing create overall beautiful picture may take overall frame rate refresh little bit lower established dl essentially bringing ai overall gaming piece overall filling pixel 2 point overall use ai overall get back overall performance level would likely seen overall ray tracing great piece technology taking much learning term data center using ai excited also bring overall gaming pervasive expect dl diﬃcult seems like guy lot work creating driver also taking little get game long take guess look holiday season year pervasive expect dl piece work term working overall software thing overall software developer develop work also helping along actually bit joint work going point time bring new technology may certain stage term building game keep mind working middle project see newer game come q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kress q joseph lawrence mooremarket later able get beginning overall development cycle probably move quite faster overall market okay mean turing said little bit slower start hoped seems like remain pretty confident second half year level hope think expectation turing overall launch little bit higher actually came lot thing likely inﬂuenced term overall macroeconomic condition may north america possibly elsewhere term overall china still great overall sale expectation overall higher excess channel inventory probably also caused part expectation met ability provide full stack turing available way super super top end lower end fuel overall market opportunity turing okay great question get lot china know pretty big market gaming business number challenge sort general macro slowdown issue game getting approval see region demand coming back important part forecast indicated end q4 possibly macro condition china allow u realize full potential term china term believe underlying demand overall gaming tough point one issue term regulatory term game approval impact term excess channel inventory leaving q4 behind u launched new product new product term 2060 tremendous great review tremendous excitement still early u see finishing chinese new year look see well chinese overall demand come back okay 1660 pretty well reviewed far well absolutely colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kressthe 1660 ti okay great guess final gaming question gross margin kind unusual environment last quarter really product clearing inventory low end get little bit mix get little bit gross margin pressure april quarter sort artificially inﬂated last quarter discussed overall gross margin largest contributor term gross margin mix mix across segment also mix inside segment thing change long term seen u consistently work improving overall gross margin long term done okay great maybe could shift gear talk hpc cloud data center business 25 sale obviously several year really explosive growth quarter 14 sound like lumpiness business seen pause elsewhere vendor cloud well talk little bit visibility segment right describe seeing u yes end q4 see deal hoped would close end quarter close really drove overall sequentially term q4 overall data center time visibility high look forward near future however believe intact key priority hyperscales well enterprise need data center think priority tremendously aligned aligned slowdown overall moore law force look new accelerated compute opportunity goal improving overall ai term also really key important short term visibility probably high move term second half year believe would restore overall visibility well demand data center guess talked segment within hpc cloud got compute got enterprise business gtx family got cloud exposure really thing sort simultaneously saw acceleration anything
