exposure analytics need fast enough sophisticated enough able model portfolio exposure experience change behavior end datasets today fragmenting quickly becoming diﬃcult figure portfolio exposure brad smallwood dave morgan craig mineard andrew appel agree fragmenting data integrity issue real look like cooky guess digital measure right used measure still look like actual like look cooky operate mobile tie across device complicated process diﬃcult tie together see lot conversion disappearing ether steve point data integrity issue real need dealt well think one thing important living world highly granular data mean one thing happened started working nielsen six year ago got data compared actual viewing data data going show advertising research foundation event mean immediately like `` oh god going embarrassing going try shut u contract `` found panel held would expected actually well mirrored actual viewing obviously granularity could see direct viewing think one thing going really

combined big data one believe one suﬃciently work think guy right figured many year ago one reason started working nielsen also one reason accumulated largest repository return path data world think say done proxy combination panel data return path data public comment specific competitor say concept buying across different form medium interesting space think lot development great thank let jump q unidentified participant brad smallwood steve hasker unidentified participant dave morgani wonder guy think term whether wechat gotten closer holy grail able show ad impression actually provide payment track payment i.e. run ad say `` sale went amount actually ca comment directly wechat stuff think great example think everyone room look think worth looking problem brad talked attribution right people wechat also many platform also getting many exposure always got careful metric say `` spend dollar platform sale go following add claim gdp china gdp u whatever geographic territory double triple time 11 period time need attribution comprehensive market view one attribution mean tv always seems get slack new digital ad guy get asked `` roic roi roi tv say `` hi catching second difference privacy issue following tracking europe versus u especially given change two disparate question jump first one reason tv behind roi game virtually measurement historically done medium mix

directly every ad exposure television end level measure although may view roi think come reach exposure tv much higher standard digital ever much higher since first day right digital publisher claim anything could digital ad rating came along could claim anything long completely haywire monthly audience estimate and/or server log information fine went next campaign tv hit audience measured nielsen make good think point come around attribution tv historically held accountable move product explicitly dave said implicitly always whether form digital folk much quicker go think starting see tv folk catch simulmedia driving lot dave offer advertiser guarantee based roi number think seeing player like cbs campaign performance audit difference company leaning independent measure captive metric grading homework market need go get everybody point reach metric accountability metric whole conversation go away privacy craig mineard brad smallwood andrew appel craig mineard unidentified

europe think mean operating going able operate personalized data business europe mean ca wo predictability called cbs one tv company dave holback would kill forgotten cpa measure really strong independent measure put four public company would mentioned time one one talk tracking service able track people track conversion seems like facebook real advantage user follow across device straddle line third party coming helping grow overall business versus competitive advantage think question identity asset 1.59 billion people advantage steve mentioned people want medium company measuring question done dar tar done nielsen company well third party come leverage asset order measurement people want u measuring really strategy using like enabling measurement using data asset one last one wrap steve hasker andrew appel craig mineardmost conversation affecting causing transaction yet least business awful lot advertising done order retain customer particularly recurring revenue stream well generate brand loyalty lead transaction line deal impact advertising issue loyalty customer retention opposed transaction probably take crack think great question framework put place number year ago picked primary ad sale tool many major medium company provide metric three dimension firstly many people campaign reach rating secondly campaign resonate word basic research metric move brand recall purchase intent use neuroscience one measure brain react message last least andrew point reaction roi consumer go buy product fact matter different marketer lean differently three metric focused rate reason outlined others exhaustively focused reaction actual purchase transaction business fast purchase cycle many still middle tell lot automotive guy still middle building brand decade better worse recognize campaign successful need continue brand yes think would add set measure build towards every one actual exposure goal side build measure sale lift measure impact brand effect still work progress think penetration actual metric intent auto world kpi `` hi person go visit site based exposure becomes measure idea one get exposure portfolio measure available real time every
