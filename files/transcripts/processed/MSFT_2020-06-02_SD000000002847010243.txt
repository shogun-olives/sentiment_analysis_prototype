okay get going sorry expecting silence good morning everybody real delight microsoft present u appreciate everybody taking time day next several day dial conference make virtual conference given everything going world really proud present absolutely amazing lineup next guest interact rohan kumar corporate vice president azure business introduction quick introduction way rohan real delight able host conference call meeting shall say virtual meeting thank jonathan neilson everything jonathan line u well question answer rohan maybe could give u introduction role microsoft thing worked past several year serving microsoft would good context jump q kasthuri rangan rohan kumarsounds good first thank much kash team conference really appreciate way quick introduction corporate vice president leading engineering called azure data analytics team inside microsoft team responsible everything around data analytics public cloud starting sql server product database managed service azure operational database sql course open source everything around nosql analytics governance data basically team lead microsoft 21 year grew engineer working window team moved sql ever since share ironic thing worst majored engineering back india worst programmer campus could program job run mainframe decided software analyst instead blast ironically good programmer would programmer would chance cover industry 20,000 foot altitude related 25 year believe failed programming covering software industry coming 25 26 year funny slightly embarrassing background way let talk topic people mind coronavirus impact look like microsoft azure business actually benefiting talk customer buying behavior priority might changed better worse respect coronavirus particular line work azure data side thanks question kash obviously relevant important one first foremost would say focus frankly helping customer community employee partner dealing challenging time definitely first responder health care worker priority azure fact microsoft definitely point seen growth azure consumption particularly look workload enable remote work mean think publicly spoken growth usage microsoft team course internally relies lot azure core azure service definitely area seen growth workload course virtual desktop window virtual desktop usage active directory specifically interesting called look data analytics business fascinating satya sort mentioned seen two year worth transformation couple week definitely see several industry looking digitally transform last say least 3 3.5 year conversation several enterprise customer medium really large one around digital transformation could related everyone looking becoming company decision made based system actually give insight needed could around better engaging customer building better product even class like saving operational cost deep understanding value chain heart transformation cause modern data platform especially heavily focused design allows economically scale predictive analytics journey lot customer apart newer renovation say lot cost saving element well right able sort really pay service using lot resource like anything hearing several customer journey looking happened covid way significantly expedite transformation sense feel given disruption seeing happen around digital transformation definitely see trend going positive impact data analytics business specifically look sort speak product like synapsis unified analytics story launched ignite last year significant interest customer leveraging synapse simplicity creates everything data integration data warehousing big data analytics single unified product right cost element customer looking saying look move service significantly reduces time cost kasthuri rangan rohan kumarand operational side course seeing significant growth migration imagine existing sql server customer looking move workload public cloud save cost build intelligent application extending workload thing see cosmos db lot nosql workload around mongo cassandra draft database essentially lot customer looking moving expediting move operational database sql cosmos db open source offering got specifically covid rohan catalyzing think two thing definitely value piece would say kash every industry point looking investment going make specifically whole cost element right save discussion happening business requirement go away anything look driving business based clear insight becomes even important investment make modernize data platform analytics platform anything urgency built discussion covid saying okay innovation piece actually get lot value term lower cost right really look one key piece innovation customer expecting modernize data platform ton friction today like look give specific example look modernizing core enterprise data warehouse may customer system like multi like massively powerful processing architecture design effectively many way reached limit term far scale go system something public cloud amount service need stitched together create solution high problem realized three 3.5 year ago working service called synapse greatly reduces friction term time insight cost take amount engineering effort need stitch together drastically reduced right directly translates saving time saving cost maintenance software need write system taking care kasthuri rangan rohan kumarso covid say definitely pushed discussion customer really pushing understand aspect okay great digital transformation continue journey obviously covid pushed forward thing reducing cost aspiration go away discussion turned lot value creation piece make sense absolutely certainly quick reminder client dialing dialed wish ask question please chat question portal pick pose mention name sound really smart question going come take credit smart question identify name another question rohan microsoft certainly software company talked increasing usage azure platform within set customer certain vertical whereas vertical seen usage come net effect azure business versus good question say expected right mean every customer sort speak every industry almost across board everyone sort going challenging time right term situation find fascinating though like take look certain aspect clearly changing fast pace one talk whole notion remote everything like foundationally changed people work foreseeable future sort going remain satya mentioned discussion maybe cio ceo ctos term investment plan make like everyone effectively acknowledged pace transforming sort become significant clearly call reduce tco maintaining innovation agenda looking business continuity plan mean pretty big thing look getting people like hey happens specific region accessible ensure business continues overall believe well positioned capitalize trend given offering change term work live seeing also like mentioned previously whole push towards getting culture insight truly driving business mean invest data platform infrastructure kasthuri rangan rohan kumarnow term overall trend say especially azure business security productivity apps basically business application investment making developer seeing ton traction around specifically look take look structural change whole play digital twin iot sort see lot traction happening around whole notion like replicate lot iot infrastructure quickly make progress everything around smart building automated factory remote selling curbside pickup given restriction leading area past maybe seen lot growth change seeing overall would say hard sort clearly certain vertical definitely seeing lot believe temporary contraction deal challenge going absolutely remain bullish encouraging view future hold given offering wonderful used microsoft sql server highly regarded like 15 20 year back people would always consider oracle database sabre database truly database microsoft sql server departmental installation buyer survey perennially period time microsoft always come second third term consideration last two year microsoft shot 1 position respect customer looking oracle slipped 2 position happen mean future database market insignificant market even bigger cloud computing market stand course cloud computing market compute storage going naturally overtake database database highest value item sector always baï¬ „ ed spend 40,000 per processor spend 3,000 5,000 per instance operating system highest value part stack job coming left field rising term customer priority talk u significance going forward rohan thank think great question first point raised around sql server 20 25 year ago departmental database mean fact right mean take look sort started clearly oracle others market long time especially came sort remember back 2000 earlier 2000 2005 time sort joined sql server team well part clear lot departmental apps like tier 2 tier 3 kind workload sql server gaining prominence point question around hey really running tier 0 tier 1 enterprise workload say kash last definitely last almost 20 year two thing clearly focused course driven term technology trend seen relationship building enterprise customer learn best serve two thing one clearly make substantial investment done several release culminating right recently sql server 2019 look journey started sql server 2005 pivotal release term making like fairly substantial change architecturally enable high scale high throughput low latency ever since expanded total type data dealing look focus around high availability disaster recovery focus processing looking hardware trend leverage ssds lot better gpus recently look process memory still becoming big thing laser intentional focus meeting need highest class demanding enterprise customer one part thing really around focus around developer experience ease use frankly reï¬‚ect back thing really got u successful enterprise whole combination dev tool experience microsoft building inside .net visual basic ease ease managing core aspect making thing easy database complex critical fact one piece feedback heard adoption sql server grew learn like 50,000 different knob go set database lot intelligence embed make thing easy wanted build highly performant application rocket scientist right course certain amount understanding system relational model relational algebra see thing kasthuri ranganbut constant area focus u make simple part like reï¬‚ect back kash genesis azure go back mission talk empowering every human every organization achieve really basis come u tool company sort provide make thing easy fascinating mean seen several analyst course like mentioned lot report coming across preferred vendor run application last four five year actually hypothesis foundationally changed u put u right top data platform deep understanding enterprise customer market heritage sql server grew look pivot since 2010 made cloud computing offering manage sql server open source database getting big analytics fairly wide portfolio service offer speak lot cio frankly ctos say look prefer sql prefer microsoft path towards want sort bet company well positioned future investment make let say today even though may move cloud next maybe one three year ensure investment made around app model business model et cetera carry forward humility say believe data platform tech innovation done business model innovation ensure customer betting sql server get significant value move cloud super beneficial focus like performance scale ease use developer bet given portfolio cloud innovation agenda really resonated well customer sorry answer wanted â€ “ passionate completely appreciate look paas market think mike schutz p h said number year pivot within azure cloud business paas paas certainly higher value higher retention higher margin le albeit versus compute storage talk u future paas business look like microsoft biggest thing microsoft investing successful paas side sense exposure paas lot higher percentage overall business relative say amazon google microsoft legacy really came right rohan kumar kasthuri rangan rohan kumar absolutely talk u little bit aspiration paas mean say think point view really believe kash investment going happen future multiple trend going right clearly element call lift shift modernization lot customer strategic asset term application workload want move cloud course want move cloud little investment side term change need make right whole look trend like offering paas significantly improved term compatibility see sort reduce change need make easier move let say application deployed virtual machine basically want rent virtual machine cloud host definitely term friction easiest way belief course huge business around infrastructure support customer window server sql server key play u migration motion look future application written especially sort start thinking around intelligent cloud intelligent edge application tend distributed paas layer enables focus lot business logic scale requirement worry much underlying resource getting provisioned right look like new micro service design becoming extremely popular among developer community inherently foundation require paas service let say data layer right offering need purpose build let say need relational database need nosql database want sort use open source like postgres mysql mongodb developer preference compatibility important notion creating vm provisioning desk provisioning network tying together complexity making sure behind securely locked behind virtual network thing effectively paas layer make greatly simplified think time build application get ready get app running going question strong point view investment made path like service kasthuri rangan rohan kumarhave data analytics side way sort thinking function app model basically write code compute get provisioned sort get going simplicity developer creates going pretty amazing look app usage right would say migration definitely strong play believe play next maybe three seven year time believe lot lot new application going written paas model heard one resellers last fiscal believe wo mention number expose anybody certain number database installed incumbent market leader actually replaced microsoft azure sql server talk u hearing customer partner respect appetite completely made replace database albeit superiority microsoft database lot discussion around two say maybe broadly two thing driving discussion kash first course general approach towards like company imagining hey sort digitally transform compute data footprint look like right natural thing around okay want sort manage data center want manage physical machine want manage power everything come strategic bet around okay let go move workload public cloud part obviously every customer looking spend may using different version database looking okay move cloud term modern architecture design help move transition even may first step may move model strategic workload strategic application get design point essentially help scale save cost help build intelligent workload able leverage machine learning ai way take forward basically discussion around independent database sort coming healthy trend term migration see even competitive database sql server even thing like postgres thing like cosmos db depending nature workload running move eventual paas service essentially give assurance right like believe specific application going strategic five year kasthuri rangan rohan kumarnow making investment essentially modernizes performance scale security ease use predictive intelligence integrating lot capability added paas service definitely see lot discussion around fact say migration sql server lot database corresponding workload cloud 1 motion amazing always like simplify complicated thing technology industry easy understand term way explain going database market would say client look ferrari great car use case uber different people margin want uber need ferrari would characterize shift database market question incremental demand coming uber couple minute curious get perspective azure competitive advantage differentiation aws gcp want stick database okay broader perspective think edge aws gcp got yes think fair question fact get asked time thing always sort start course important aware trend investment going thing fundamentally drive innovation agenda hearing customer point view get built term best serve interesting like take look day lot worried hey issue customer running getting signal really richest thing term investment make thing normally share heard customer right like successful azure basically share multiple thing thing many way sort stand focus around enterprise security governance thing learned worked customer 25 year lot talk performance scale predictive intelligence ai going change world true great reality biggest thing customer worry look major transition like hey environment going secure putting data somewhere else guarantee providing around encryption isolation given everything else heard around leakage et cetera right basically trust around microsoft offering interesting look like led lot product core capability built around security privacy governance data sort leading customer tell u hey unique strong point view resonates well especially one regulated industry like financial service health care government manufacturing really resonates thing like said sort brieï¬‚y discussed whole focus around current lift shift really need maybe next one three year believe world evolves like specific pattern talk customer deep engagement manner around depending business need depending time frame looking could go path iaa first pick strategic workload longer lead time sort short circuit thing heard customer microsoft clear point view based requirement force go go always discussion based talk learned right many case migrating different database may best option looking completing move let say within three month six month versus coming saving cost really looking transition could take little longer part clear point view future believe believe also always talk microsoft u offer service kash one thing always talk customer presentation let tell microsoft evolved decision made make kasthuri ranganand ambition really satya effectively made one requirement u azure computer entire world microsoft course talk journey best making resonates well something different selling whole bunch service product customer lot learning microsoft scale help u create clear point view finally look publicly spoken investment iot intelligent edge believe going become critical cloud application future almost everything connected going intelligent could consumer device could manufacturing plant connected car whatever invested last three year application model give consistency across worry deploying arm device low power deploying public cloud like thousand core programming model consistent security aspect consistent people get understand realize consistency like today example sql server give example run everything arm device maybe le 1 gb node running synapse query right across petabyte data developer write security model ai exactly score super powerful right application become distributed actually think part come genesis understanding developer community broader reach open source right thing call stuff customer tell u differentiated help u sort build agenda hopefully useful absolutely end allocated time depth insightful thank much rohan thank jonathan always support everything conference quick announcement make believe next presentation one colleague wamsi mohan first rohan
