okay everybody start happy hot cloud company seattle join u slot instructed read safe harbor statement start begin microsoft may make looking statement presentation refer sec filing risk factor relating business true whether person listening web check mike schutz kind enough ﬂown join u db event mike maybe could talk little bit role term title general manager cloud platform marketing know part microsoft broader cloud enterprise unit maybe worth starting little description everything context absolutely thank karl hi everybody name mike schutz general manager cloud platform product marketing responsibility include cloud platform capability would include private cloud capability like window server system center public cloud microsoft azure expect talk lot today enterprise mobility capability would also fall within umbrella microsoft cloud platform product within new cloud enterprise division really pleased today got important point start people think microsoft cloud generally think azure maybe broadly defined include oﬃce 365 definition provided cloud platform extends well beyond mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz right start top level think microsoft cloud microsoft commercial cloud think oﬃce 365 dynamic crm azure capability within double click within cloud platform capability really want focus service within microsoft azure roughly fall category like hybrid cloud perspective well raw storage compute cloud platform capability organization think modernizing application isvs think building cloud native application saas apps lot platform capability offer azure data platform capability think extending value application really taking advantage big data analytics hadoop structured unstructured data machine learning extending advanced analytics iot lastly enterprise mobility increasingly mobile world help organization get handle security manageability mobile productive workforce providing companion service oﬃce 365 help organization secure device secure application ultimately data kind breadth cloud asset also think offering consistent private cloud capability organization build private cloud hybrid cloud using technology cut cloth public cloud put data center mike think across cloud asset think recent demand trend thing picked feel like inﬂection point change last pick six month whether kind workload microsoft customer moving whether vertical really inﬂected term migration cloud demand trend worth calling group sure absolutely first thing biggest change happened last 12 18 month conversation shifted cloud move cloud embrace different vertical different challenge respect regulatory compliance data sovereignty geographic distribution etc large seeing tremendous appetite decision maker nit decision maker line business look cloud whether saas apps whether thinking modernizing infrastructure proven lowest friction way start cloud think starting dev test ph bringing application try bringing application back prem starting point karl keirstead mike schutzthing line business application benefit always kind take existing app without modification run cloud even though designed cloud lot customer taken step least part application estate le moving app think extending data center extending asset cloud term demand signal seeing one huge explosive growth organization get comfortable cloud understand benefit cost saving ultimately agility able provide organization able thing faster instead waiting week month get server deployed infrastructure new app deployed demand moving service like getting analytics capability seeing lot increased usage service one example got maybe dive different component microsoft cloud platform mentioned beginning likely talk azure part right hot topic obviously microsoft disclose azure revenue talked call gave u usage metric suggests growing pretty good clip obviously aws giant multiple larger azure whatever azure number got competitor like google got ibm softlayer hyperscale also hypercompetitive think everyone would love hear two three main way trying differentiate infrastructure space particular aws big differentiating aws sure absolutely great question often dialogue customer many customer tried used aws absolutely dialogue frequently talked hyperscale fundamentally one way differentiate couple three hyperscale cloud world u one operate today 19 region mean 19 data center region globally continue expand customer need u put perspective twice many aws five six time google cloud platform even combined aws google cloud region two combined hyperscale important important customer want service customer one fundamental tenet aws big karl keirstead mike schutzthe element really differentiation come around hybrid fundamental strategy help customer deploy technology put public cloud hyperscale data center run data center top top system center asset well bringing azure capability run data center ﬂexibility help decide application move also set capability provide connective tissue private cloud public cloud whether customer running private cloud technology example storage product called storsimple think like box storage environment iscsi storage device plug existing environment premise look like storage area network seamlessly tier storage cloud customer think data center seamlessly extending fundamental differentiation approach respect hyperscale cloud vendor public cloud bust want meet customer hybrid element core strategy frankly quite important customer existing asset invest premise extend yet still fully embrace public cloud element around enterprise route support 650,000 partner worldwide broad footprint existing customer base trusted partner also focus hard security privacy compliance first public cloud provider globally support iso 27018 standard highest standard privacy today important international customer well customer north america enterprise credibility element dna helping customer enterprise core strategy highest level kind microsoft yes capability perspective also differentiated level service relative competitor said lot player microsoft aws leader gartner magic quadrant perspective aws leader public cloud paas platform microsoft well amazon also play think breadth microsoft offering help align customer looking move time think application modernization running vms cloud well broad footprint trust enterprise community karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz yes actually question know microsoft disclosed zack probably going shake head ask question talk little bit differentiation running vms cloud pure compute service storage infrastructure versus premium service top metric share maybe anecdote around mix azure changing well let tell seeing outside specific metric certainly onramp cloud azure app service paas platform azure service u data platform service see entry point customer start oftentimes combine service plus app platform part go move see addition premium service continue see growth okay could ask question one think get opportunity leverage microsoft incredible software portfolio really little bit sword get perceived potential client azure little bit bad thing got aws pitching sort swiss neutrality get beyond issue really inaudible azure yet far know full red hat enterprise limited support azure think everyone would love microsoft open technology part azure journey absolutely huge focus hope everybody seeing progress made fact today 20 20 virtual machine azure running linux think openness broadly platform used window platform azure platform focus application could window could linux whether operating system layer window linux whether data layer think got oracle supported azure sap ibm db2 also hadoop cloudera datastax lot popular data layer capability outside sql server course believe great whatever customer want data layer want support mobile device standpoint great solution help customer build mobile apps connect mobile apps android io device well course window device language perspective believe .net karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutzgreat time want make sure developer familiar would like use java node.js php ruby whatever like choose want available microsoft azure made lot progress support app o microsoft azure continue make announcement go think mike opportunity enhance relationship partnership red hat provide rhel support azure continue make progress work excited future might bring okay good mentioned minute ago ﬂipping little bit enterprise mobility side area hearing microsoft seems one popular quote premium service cloud platform yes talk little bit sound like putting amazing growth lot people room aware airwatch owned vmware extremely well mobileiron obviously competitive space blackberry bought good differentiate front well enterprise mobility perspective absolutely correct pleased growth customer adoption customer success enterprise mobility suite familiar em provides combination set category point discreet point player one hearing mobile device management increasingly turning mobile application management discreet set folk like airwatch mobileiron played got solution called microsoft intune part mobile enterprise mobility suite identity management perspective actor directory identity protecting user identity always critical customer provide online service called azure active directory premium help provide single sign karl keirstead mike schutzon authentication control saas application oﬃce 365 crm online 2,500 saas apps like workday like salesforce like others help control access maintain security enterprise using saas apps key part last component enterprise mobility suite called right management service help encrypt data encrypt file encryption follows file wherever may even get saved usb drive ca accessed unauthorized user done bring layered approach security device application data user identity wrap easy deploy easy purchase solution last report reported 17,000 customer using em today continue see great growth pleased perfect companion oﬃce 365 deep integration oﬃce 365 mobile apps io well microsoft platform really solution deep integration oﬃce 365 provides u breadth differentiation also richness experience provide end user world mobility end user really king queen really important end user great experience well appropriate level control got going take plenty question sure cloud stuff open want ask area responsibility around traditional enterprise side think mentioned window server system center stuff like sit server product realm get statistic impressed question specifically microsoft done job server product side several year posting growth close high single digit low double digit far exceeded oracle ibm lot big peer putting know number reason might share gain might guy great job maintenance attach rate might pricing licensing change always eager get color able pull point couple reason server product number last two year good sure talk window server first think sql server important element well window server perspective continues popular operating system plant look analyst report somewhere 70 80 share term operating system share karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead yes paid paid operating system yes see continued revenue growth driven business model largely around mix shift premium skus window server case really revolves around movement virtualization organization virtualize application server premium mix window server continues grow even world x86 server shipment number might soft premium mix organization virtualization infrastructure squeeze value able benefit increased revenue also much data explosion happening need server ration across data data explosion help sql server business absolutely talk also help drive server deployment cloud certainly premise secular force virtualization data really helping server business particularly premium mix sql server front certainly explosion data consolidation customer respect database workload really beneficial sql business driving premium shift core premium mix sql server also share gain respect sql server becoming workload organization taking tier 1 workload look gartner magic quadrant relational database system first year microsoft passed oracle cloud asset well sql server strength premise really helped fuel growth traditional server business okay window server business mistaken largest component whole server product revenue bucket sql server obviously pretty good well look total server product number disclose think june quarter microsoft decelerated little bit think pulled little bit commercial licensing growth number much explanation earnings call outside think amy ﬂagged mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead q unidentified participantwindows server managing grow despite relatively weak x86 server market could elaborate broader server product business microsoft june quarter window server particular well server number think constant currency 9 outpace peer market okay lot fueled innovation delivered last wave window server 2012 well announcement made 2016 wave pretty excited customer pretty excited 2016 wave preview right combine virtualization platform lot new technology born azure public cloud going able deliver premise well new container technology container pretty exciting day new container technology making window server 2016 okay lot fueling growth question answer okay got know audience probably couple mike anybody question mike around azure around part microsoft server product set go right front oh mic back go ahead yes fair amount buzz given sort latency sloth microsoft microsoft mastercard visa securing commerce guy interest discussion bank directly player creating browser solution would secure way copacetic internet general mike schutz q unidentified participant mike would likely operationally sound perspective announcement make today general whether financial vertical focused security element helping organization secure using cloud also providing product help secure announcement yes yes thanks taking question question around hinted something satya talked well technology developed solution developed azure applying premise potentially enabling share gain walk dynamic faster go market driving improve technology done azure way think virtuous cycle building public cloud battle testing cloud bringing customer run data center great example virtualization platform long time leader vmware virtualization better part last decade azure run got hundred thousand node battle testing every day feedback go directly product team able make product better rock solid deliver every customer whether enterprise enterprise customer service provider living public cloud lifestyle helping organization put data center really differentiator u area even simple thing like azure portal place average pro developer go spin vm app demand azure bought portal organization run data center call azure pack service provider hoster roll portal use one microsoft built focus service enterprise space enterprise really trying service provider business unit agile help delivering cloud computing technology battle tested public cloud environment still make decision want go public cloud application go way mobility got consistent platform premise provides lot le friction think going public cloud vision karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutzsatya talk sometimes term server edge cloud customer perspective azure seamless extension data center virtuous cycle product development perspective started window server 2012 r2 one market kind fueling growth see even 2016 wave virtuous cycle developing cloud bringing customer premise really hitting stride thanks anybody else okay keep going mike window server side think legacy version window server going end life big deal microsoft mean suppose date maintenance get free maybe large constituency revenue lift would characterize opportunity microsoft version speak window server 2003 right actually went support july 15th passed data point little bit different dynamic xp lot customer maintenance product right yet deployed newer version focus help customer get newer version necessarily focused revenue uplift might bring okay window server side room attend red hat event basically dockercon event day anything touching server o layer seems container docker ecosystem mentioned earlier microsoft providing window server 2016 support docker elaborate little bit seems big deal server o space karl keirsteadabsolutely general cloud native modern app development paradigm standpoint concept micro service container pretty hot day public cloud provider saas provider pretty ﬂuent starting make way broader community docker really helped popularize thing done make easy consume container simplify going back little bit 18 month ago announced docker support linux azure support made couple announcement since docker integrating docker hub microsoft azure continuing deepen organization would like use container linux docker prepackaged solution azure example got ubuntu image docker tooling preinstalled developer spin get going quickly traditional linux container azure docker also mentioned announced bringing container window server 2016 announced window server container similar paradigm linux container run time virtualizes operating system instead whole server get high density developer productive developing rolling new application preview got developer trying today part 2016 wave also bringing first kind type container called container brings best container known today industry additional isolation benefit virtualization context bring one thing often hear particularly enterprise around security container making sure feel comfortable using customer untrusted code like one layer security container world got container developer really make difference underlying window server container wrapped another layer security term virtualization context continue work docker deep collaboration also bringing new container technology actually exist today rest market next window server release letting developer choose want run linux container window container microsoft azure last question mike mike end one question lot discussion around thing like server o layer cloud end conversation cloud native application open source etc feel like larger firm moving little bit aggressively today try stay relevant world architecture infrastructure look mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutzdifferent open source containerized etc high level kind thing microsoft stay relevant new saas next generation developer building well part making sure working openly community whether open source community working partner innovating space leverage platform able build application using technology actually using innovation used container micro service cloud year right commercializing bringing market innovation working openly industry ecosystem like open container initiative linux foundation help bring unified container model market working much open source community well development community known year got well microsoft obviously ton success cloud platform fun day microsoft good luck continuing scale exciting part microsoft story thanks coming db tech event thank much yes thanks u
