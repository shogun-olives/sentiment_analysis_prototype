slide jeff prepared get fireside q warm welcome jeff thanks vivek thanks repeat know talking gaming guy may thought going data center original gangster nvidia thank talk excited talk gaming know gamers expect kid hopefully geforce gamers maybe carry back back kid first think familiar statement refer filing online understand read risk uncertainty business psa let talk gaming pc gaming strong getting stronger first time guy heard say still true still believe look 2019 2022 spite tailwind pandemic work home residing gained 100 million gamers 2019 2022 according newzoo new base expect see continued growth people come gaming gaming arguably important entertainment medium world today provides competitive competitive environment provides social environment provides immersive storytelling ultimately evolve complete interactive entertainment experience reason continued see continued growth folk coming gaming also evident steam concurrent gamers saw surge concurrent gamers pandemic work home continue see growth setting new record 33 million concurrent gamers steam compare geforce gaming growth consumer pc market consumer pc market largely ﬂat ending 2022 2019 geforce gaming unit increased whopping 1.4x period time look geforce gaming revenue period time 2019 fy 2022 seen 20 cagr annual growth rate period time reﬂects also clearing channel inventory post pandemic phase growth driven new gamers creator coming pc unit lift well asp lift see gamers valuing gpu purchase upgrade pc gamers creator see upgraded pc average everyone upgrading higher class gpu asp mix becoming richer gamers choose buy higher class gpu asp unit driven growth expect see similar trend going forward look installed base huge opportunity continue upgrade installed base 44 geforce installed base yet upgrade rtx balance yet upgrade look latest announcement 60 class gpus starting 299 class core gamers core gamers much longer replacement cycle prior generation architecture ampere mostly turing earlier lower performance gpus class gamer huge opportunity u upgrade 18 installed base enjoys 3060 class performance higher balance need upgrade super excited 4060 launch class gamer segment provides u term opportunity last wanted share bit ada ramp guy know launch product new generation top starting top reason also aware ada taken u little longer move stack typical generation reason got fair amount history 699 class ada 4070 tie ada term revenue generated ramping much faster three time turing 40 faster ampere super pleased ada ramp date time ago became evident moore law slowing going allow raw transistor continue drive gaming market important u find alternate alternate path 2018 announced rtx rtx featured ray tracing core developer could create cinematic game tensor core ai first technology delivered ai technology delivered gaming dl dl provided massive performance boost dl 3 latest innovation generative ai approach rendering game dl 3 us generative ai create 7 pixel every pixel rendered guy think folk know gen ai work become powerful performance boost quality image quality boost game gamers 400 game apps supporting dl ecosystem start rtx launch continued innovate ray tracing performance dl ai feature inside chip result 16 time improvement beginning rtx current generation ada operation per pixel effectively function image quality performance delivered 16x image quality performance transistor count gone 4x result rtx transformed gaming built ecosystem around new level performance image quality accelerated ai game changer apps especially gaming microsoft gave huge boost ai pc working make pc client ai build developer conference week back build microsoft announced framework ai model window apps released set tool developer isvs developer build provide model window apps nvidia microsoft announced collaboration accelerate ai model coming window nvidia gpus look consider ai pc ai apps next killer app pc believe could easily happen need range hardware accelerate like gaming like graphic accelerate ai model look stack entry laptop way desktop gpu 4090 provide huge range compare call dlas vpus whatever call ai accelerator built future cpu socs accelerating number call small model ai accelerator perfect type mainstream ai apps like noise reduction background blur keeping eye gaze screen become broad base work developer ai developer model heavier weight model thing developer really want change user experience like generative ai way full character animation like gaming going need entire range performance family gpus deliver range performance like gaming computex said last week forget got back taiwan think last week announced first ai platform gaming ace game really great example look future interactive entertainment gaming ace game one nvidia ai foundry game developer bring game lore ph game even game asset nvidia train character become knowledgeable specifically domain game talk character inside game could ask anything history lore game ask something 2024 presidential election vivek want answer wanted clue going vivek arya jeff fisher q vivek aryaon take context ai foundry effectively bring asset train model specific character inside game ace gaming effectively three component riva speech processing process input speech talking character nemo large language model gen ai chat chat model take input speech ultimately riva convert text nemo create response riva take response convert speech back character another technology called audio2face take audio stream convert animated character component omniverse riva nemo omniverse three main component make ace game developer either take total take piece provide put workﬂow want show demo ace game want also want point recorded chat conversation specific game prescripted let take look ace game video presentation peak future close gaming strong growing rtx transformed gaming broken loose moore law ai game changer apps specifically gaming really looking forward opportunity brings thank listening opening excellent vivek question answer think could watch game day long go q maybe start showed impressive chart big upgrade opportunity large deployed base nvidia gamers deployed base grown time jeff fisher q vivek arya jeff fisher q vivek arya jeff fisher yeah got installed base nvidia game 200 let say 200 200 million nvidia gamers pc grown time mean unit grown 10 annualized think probably fair estimate got one interesting statistic saw 18 upgraded 3060 class use 3060 metric like special 3060 use metric right used compare multiple speaker yeah mean taken u get ada series 60 class lot talk much opportunity think 60 series perspective perfect upgrade huge installed base gamers remember bringing 60 series way 299 price 3060 share team mean optimism market go pursue device got seen far term ada adoption trend think initially launched skus last year think mentioned launched 60 sku well adoption ada typical somebody two generation three generation old typical gamer upgrading ada yeah good question kind depends stack talking mean shared 4070 tie relative prior gen fact early result lower ada also strong mean really pleased ada ramp talk upgrading highest end gamers 4090 gamer want play everything turned want play aaa game want play everything turned perspective ray tracing dl see 2x improvement gen gen mean upgrading ampere going see really great improvement upgrading prior gen kind lot go stack especially 60 series gamers much longer replacement cycle go back two generation longer comparison relative turing device something even turing easily class even basic raster gaming going see 2x performance well q vivek arya jeff fisher q vivek arya jeff fisher q vivek arya jeff fisher q vivek arya got typical upgrade frequency look conventional pc know people might upgrade like four five six year right likely five year six year timeframe typical upgrade frequency enthusiast gamer yeah tell expectation highest end gamers upgrade every generation mean like best likely wherewithal afford ph high end gen. every 2 2.5 year right get bottom stack think stretching probably 3.5 year 4.5 year replacement cycle probably see upgrade new pc sold shorter overall pc cycle frequency yeah averaging somewhere around 3 3.5 3 3.5 year something 3 3.5 year yeah got collect data upgrade typically assume would upgrade sku right yeah yeah good question mean gamers using client think talked geforce help keep pc upgraded latest driver automatically help automatically set best setting every game day super important hardware also share u history among user see upgraded graphic card inside pc seen gamers buying time lift buying continues increase great testimony value place gpu relative component pc willing invest great entertainment experience answer question yes see increasing investment gamers upgrading within base gpu ph user easy way jeff look much mentioned seen kind unit growth right installed base content expansion nvidia also 5 10 right way think content growth time asked question think two instance hesitate use jeff fisher q vivek arya jeff fisher q vivek arya jeff fisher q vivek arya jeff fisher q vivek aryaword crypto caused lot confusion created normal lift pricing side kind normalize think average content right mix installed base say mix mean content yeah okay well good question first look look mix upsell remember even day call product shortage throughout pandemic work home crypto mentioned really change gpu pricing mean way measured upsell core price ultimately got inﬂated end market seen today ada class 699 300 400 upgrade mix high end gamers buying ada buying much lower class product super exciting u ampere speculate 200 300 upgrade range turing probably bit seen increasing mix upgrade time get right saying people upgraded ampere average bought card 200 expensive upgrading ada buying something 300 400 expensive right relative relative yeah relative pc right similar mix math long period time also kind avergae across base simple like simplicity give u unit mix help u jeff fisher q vivek arya jeff fisher q vivek arya jeff fisher well think sure answering question exactly historically seen 10 lift unit 10 lift asp time see reason necessarily trend would change see one interesting thing also alluded kind synergy nvidia gaming data center perspective right benefit data center company vice versa right benefit yeah great question thought going ask going throw money data center like way phrased better effectively nvidia long time easy see company grown mean unified architecture across device unlike guess many company certainly scale single engineering hardware engineering team single architecture team core product took atomic level guess cuda core cuda core used build gaming franchise also powering ai hardware investment cuda core continue drive road map data center ai side well gaming side time also think jensen often describes company giant kitchen like involved cooking imagine inside kitchen really incredible technology shared across business investing driving ai platform data center quite time starting bring gaming mean could see ace gaming taking riva nemo omniverse thing seen business bringing formatting bringing game development community powerful company way organized unified architecture powerful business see try stray far outside hard leverage investment got one question look back half year lot concern consumer spending right china forth think growth gaming think expecting kind typical seasonal lift think right thing going tougher second half given consumer macro concern q vivek arya jeff fisher q vivek arya jeff fisheryeah q1 came expected seasonal expect year see expect year play seasonably larger second half think also assuming stability relative stand today world mean anything change china got pocket strength also macro weakness europe would say similar scenario u generally base business foundation business relative people want game want play latest game inaudible caught diablo iv huge game open beta soon going released expect starfield call duty next really driver folk coming upgrading hardware game spite macro optimistic see regular seasonality year got jeff look next 5 year 10 year think remains hardware business become software subscription business time would pro con happen yeah well think going hardware business foreseeable future mean think game got long way go deliver always refer real life real time going take continued hardware investment economical way deliver really client gamer buy pc best experience local may continue move stack guy know volume mainstream largely disappeared entry class gpu gaming segment remains quite strong know question cloud ultimately gaming expand massive universe hesitate use word metaverse may dirty word room think large interactive shared experience going become super important important way people going want play game time local pc going used rendering ai modeling cloud play important role time cloud part likely software always component driving gaming think either buying subscribing hardware local cloud right maybe one last one nvidia enjoyed strong 70 80 market share right among enthusiast gamers competitor also bringing number new product also buy transistor foundry yeah q vivek arya jeff fisher q vivek arya jeff fisher q vivek arya give confidence maintain kind high right premium market share yeah well buy transistor great mean core level level playing field innovate top mean want point read headline asp pricing offer full stack mean offer 4090 actually priced 3090 tie know anybody realizes 4060 priced 3060 range price competitor come certain pricing fine gamer pick geforce built really promise compatibility
