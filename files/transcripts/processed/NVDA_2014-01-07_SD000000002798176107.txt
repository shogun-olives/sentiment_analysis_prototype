keep car adaptive cruise control done automatically using computer tremendous amount processing power involved demonstrated second thing showed rendered instrument cluster amount horsepower invite come nvidia booth really see kind grasp looking instrument panel using tool developed nvidia incredible amount software create brushed aluminum bump rubber chrome thing could tegra 4 amount computation required create something look real lit using global illumination create level realism possible unless tremendous q harlan sur rob csongor q harlan suramount computing power tegra brings instrument cluster okay let see think today say word android people think phone tablet mobile one thing announced yesterday announcement together google nvidia together audi honda hyundai gm announced open automobile alliance group objective mission bring android platform device always mobile car talked past android moving beyond phone tablet lot device like television console yesterday announcement concrete delivery going see android lot different device nvidia focus tegra segment android market visual computing matter automobile clearly one one announcement see today nvidia audi announcing three new thing announcing new infotainment system twice power previous generation announcing fully integrated rear seat tablet integrates together car infotainment system announcing first fully rendered instrument cluster powered nvidia tegra one thing cool done last night audi keynote rupert stadler chairman board ceo audi announced new system called zfas zfas astounding know guy saw announcement last night keynote audi two car drive onto stage zfas system piloted driving nvidia ceo came onstage audi announce zfas powered tegra exciting u result lot work nvidia pleased question answer great well thanks overview team showcasing tegra obviously guy working 28 nanometer silicon think tablet using based tegra correct yes one think showed version press event sunday guess question team going position start shipping qualified production unit going rob csongor q harlan sur rob csongor q harlan sur rob csongor q harlan sur rob csongor q harlan suractually start see tegra showing customer smartphones tablet 2014 2015 give u sense time line yes sure year sure okay announced tegra announcing demo demo last year sneak preview logan last year announcing moving production going see device built q1 would expect would see device device start coming q2 time frame likely announcement likely announcement done close launch product right exception last night announcement audi assuming first device going rolled going based architecture versus denver architecture fair assumption yes right harlan first device coming a15 demoed last night first time part literally come back like week ago running said hey let show think mean functioning part right look come really second half year okay one trend smartphone tablet space application processor perspective seen integrated platform coming market word integrated apps rob csongor q harlan sur rob csongorprocessor lte baseband modem question similar tegra 4 strategy tegra 4i integrated lte cellular connectivity strategy going pursue well announced anything announced tegra right announced kind roadmap really beyond clear modem important u one thing audi talked last night concept connected car car going connected via lte almost continuously recent report came 2017 almost every car road connected continuous basis investment made acquiring icera recognition key component visual computing baseband business visual computing business baseband help u case integrated solution might make sense case discrete solution would make sense think see get market think unveil roadmap see make decision go okay relates tegra vcm automotive think great example addressing need processing horsepower processing capability car support thing like ada right thing like collision avoidance ada requires heavy computational power running sophisticated algorithm move intelligence car increase nvidia dollar content per car looking next 1 three year example take current audis shipping today think tegra 3 maybe compare partnership announcing today car much tegra content could see next 2 three year could end would say many eight processor per car first car nvidia really focused infotainment say infotainment really mean car nav
