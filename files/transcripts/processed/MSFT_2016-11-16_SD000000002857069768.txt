customer trialing seen early interest three key pillar e5 advanced security compliance advanced analytics voice lot capability voice set skus commercially could given workload customer tend get entire suite may start workload get entire suite add value premium tier role ai popular topic valley conference yes start think different application powering kind knowing role ai initiative going forward huge mean look first thing people tell deliver ai first thing got wonder unique data unique signal oﬃce billion billion data point user interact product signaling u share document brent signal email somebody sends email dwell seven eight minute email versus typical minute two signal signal data oﬃce 365 treat customer data customer signal got lot lot billion endpoint data signal bring machine learning ai technique natural language processing give back end user customer unique insight let give couple example let say editing document word preparing report think maybe want reuse chart report

document 150 different integration possible including hootsuite zendesk asana many others overall mean framing microsoft team alone making oﬃce 365 best collaboration toolkit customer q brent thill rajesh jha q brent thill rajesh jhahave oﬃce 365 want make sure got different way team may collaborating full toolkit onenote great product maybe level light lot evernote groupie get evernote groupie get onenote yes let start pushing little bit look oﬃce got 1 billion user hard compare something like onenote something like delve something like word outlook 1 billion 0.5 billion user onenote actually mean seeing great adoption onenote segment mean let take ed example mean see level inking support onenote math problem auto recognizes formula allow teacher notebook every classroom bringing onenote organization actually introducing rest organization full oﬃce 365 think surface hub new new anymore collaboration big screen interface onenote whiteboard application term migration evernote

common theme around linkedin know closed ca probably say much pretty powerful think thing guy could together impact oﬃce family look impact outlook application example someone leaf job perhaps get populate data someone changed phone number email saying saying mean love kind interview asking question answering guess one example maybe perspective think biggest impact franchise yes look excited linkedin really ca say lot mean happy come back closed let process play respectful process excited could okay keep talking benefit see please maybe little bit e5 adoption driving important voice yes sure good job explaining tiering oﬃce say customer move cloud let say start mail calendar generates lot data content cloud good job serving need build confidence may end moving something like sharepoint skype cloud u generates data custodian cloud next thing customer want want thing like put legal hold want protect data want analytics data lead e3 basic level data leakage protection conditional lapse ph course operational security built oﬃce 365 want advanced analytics want advanced security well get e3 stuff like advanced threat protection voice power bi get e5 guess saying usage user data data right earn give premium value part e3 e5 basic thesis adding e5 value like said e5 three thrust security compliance really excited set stuff able bring customer power bi something call myanalytics analytics side example know guy seen capability oﬃce e5 user able see one insight losing touch sent piece email many sent piece email let say 30 40 people many would want know many time got read read rate thing super respectful privacy le five people wo give insight let say send 20 30 people able see read rate many reply forward mail kind analytics insight second pillar third one let talk little bit voice oﬃce 365 e5 lot voice capability excited first thing conferencing e3 oﬃce conferencing customer could voice conferencing completely based cloud customer would bring pstn conferencing built e5 shop conferencing need another one pbx system complicated manage complicated update run completely cloud proposition voice e5 third one microsoft actually give q brent thill rajesh jha q brent thill rajesh jha q brent thill rajesh jhaphone number calling plan many country think value voice three component value say give phone number get phone number microsoft e5 pstn calling feature pretty compelling good question role file system say launch new window 10 machine launched log sudden onedrive pop authentication saved talk little bit importance onedrive headed yes mean one thing done lot talked oﬃce 365 consumer business quite happy consumer business 24 million subscriber today oﬃce 365 consumer space value user get get terabyte storage onedrive onedrive great integration mentioned back core device get always client ai feature talked start show subscriber ai feature kind thing ca easily customer differentiation u actually put value cloud think onedrive core part value proposition oﬃce user consumer get terabyte storage client part 365 consumer subscription enterprise get onedrive business compliance capability reliability reliability geo distribution multinational choose set user onedrive europe set user onedrive north america capability offer onedrive commercial space several question around security specifically around email security given many breach happen via email q brent thillyes email universal communication dial tone always risk abuse email one feature really resonating u e5 today something called advanced threat protection idea advanced threat protection actually quite simple look oﬃce 365 protect malware course part e1 lot threat zero day malware signature updated people send bad link link bad got link turn bad later fact malware worked go hack website click link get phished advanced threat protection basically detonates know use word detonate kind symbolic way every attachment every link virtual machine try see nothing malicious thing uniquely att available market another offering couple vendor something uniquely today problem advanced threat protection send phishing mail brent mail probably going delayed five minute sometimes seven minute detonation take time oﬃce 365 give mail right away reading bunch mail could read mail right away click attachment attachment click attachment able detonate test say scanned mail attachment third thing looking chance finished detonating gone updated inbox message inbox attachment call instant delivery deliver right away detonate background update write inbox soon got kind integration security security business oﬃce 365 data experience let give another example threat protection easy tell u hi oﬃce surface area outlook sending mail forwarding attachment somebody organization outlook detect business rule right tell hi want still want send anyway audited kind thing lot lot example security value added oﬃce tier e1 e3 e5 guess number question like potential partnership better opportunity work closely security vendor like proofpoint mimecast relationship working rajesh jha q brent thill rajesh jha q brent thill rajesh jha well mail customer security vendor want filter mail could point mx record vendor mail routed vendor finished get routed oﬃce 365 kind integration already possible easily doable course thing like talked like instant delivery operationally closed detonation happening mail delivered physically closed given data center kind thing think uniquely basic level integration vendor totally possible today routing mx record question around statistic around dynamic crm attaching broader oﬃce 365 sale yes top head good u okay question around subscription versus product think going forward 365 oh mean cloud versus yes really good question let give anecdotal data first four year ago would say yes maybe four year ago talking bunch cio thinking moving cloud biggest feedback well ca move cloud feature x z cloud get today discussion entirely different today look thing like microsoft team took look delve took look ai threat intelligence graph one accrues cloud today cloud clearly better term complete solution like said committed customer serve allow hybrid bunch ai ml stuff incredibly hard ai ml require lot compute lot access data lot lot signal super hard lift cloud infrastructure move q brent thill rajesh jha q brent thill rajesh jha q brent thillso think whole discussion changed talk customer issue hi could bring cloud value point hybrid configuration excellent thank time thank brent really appreciate insight yes thanks guy
