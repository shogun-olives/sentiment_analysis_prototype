accelerated computing accelerating accelerator wanted find difference okay soon hey guy fish hey guy trying give talk close door analyst meeting guy come nvidia formal event always seems like home cooking okay accelerated computing accelerated computing particularly important today cpu scaling longer happening exponential rate used time application workload demand computing growing incredibly fast question extend moore law extend moore law well came idea called accelerated computing decade half ago 26 year ago first started company realized accelerator could help u achieve performance otherwise impossible normal computer accelerator built identified one particular accelerator call time saw one presentation 26 year ago say bless ph sustainable opportunity sustainable opportunity meaning particular application called virtual reality trying achieve virtual reality 3d graphic going take nearly forever reason order create environment simulate physic life physic particle physic material physic simulate physic fast practical purpose going take forever reason time simulator supercomputer simulating ï¬‚uid dynamic simulation particle simulation taking week supercomputer odds going able 120 frame per second able simulate interaction agent performing artificial intelligence capability interacting together odds happening within lifetime approximately zero wrong identified one problem statement said sustainable opportunity 10 year 10 year discovered fact order continue expand expand aperture thing accelerated longer suï¬ƒcient accelerate graphic first simulate physic accelerate graphic simulate water simulate leaf blowing wind simulate thing particle physic building crumbled possible animated decided simulate expanded aperture accelerator invented idea called cuda could expand accelerating graphic domain virtual reality domain virtual reality time transitioned graphic accelerator domain accelerator became accelerated computing company accelerator accelerates function accelerated computing platform accelerates domain application make sense accelerator video accelerator h.264 accelerator audio codec accelerator stuff run audio codec exception analog run software thing function video decoder encoder run software fact first prototype decoder software first prototype encoder software function computer function run software possible design accelerator one function would use video decoder decode video would use video decoder compute molecular dynamic would use video encoder encode video h.264 h.265 back good old day mpeg1 mpeg2 would use video encoder example recurrent neural net deep learning design recurrent neural net deep learning accelerator would able use example random forest machine learning algorithm design functionality accelerate one functionality would certainly good necessary aperture accelerate large domain challenge course created product aperture infinite domain done created cpu reason accelerated computing wise reason although many parallel computing approach come u reason lasted test time allowed cpu cpu good accelerated domain application good disciplined trying figure expand aperture reducing aperture time strategic choice ultimately strategy see gtc several thing could test whether something accelerator accelerated computing platform course first thing programmable architecture one hand one day molecular dynamic day quantum chemistry day simulate large climate science program called worth another day reconstructing image electron microscopy called nobel prize physic two year ago hard able

actually going well bit pause large hyperscalers towards end last year digested big purchase earlier year temporary amount traction announcement heard yesterday matt garman t4 nvidia rapid platform incorporated machine learning platform forth mean amount stuff customer actually quite boggling sure business going follow okay let talk little bit size market overall server market today 100 billion feel 37 billion right performance computing jensen described decade ago little decade ago introduced cuda scientific computing first segment course point commanding position market right supercomputing center every major university research center deploying really accelerated computing model five year ago deep learning came front hyperscalers like google microsoft facebook quickly realized artificial intelligence deep learning going transform business need fast computing platform cpu going cut migrated towards gpus quickly saw opportunity leaned big time took cuda architecture widened aperture little jensen put library cudnn soon working framework developer best platform deep learning really well hyperscalers couple year ago think even traditional industrial company automotive healthcare retail financial service leader began realize hey ai going transform business wanted start using deep learning introduced dgx supercomputing appliance allows ai really quickly get good start starting make real progress enterprise okay start jensen mentioned data science new workload going major impact segment going mean computing part server market going double next five year believe nvidia addressable opportunity arkam going 50 billion give take really excited okay let talk little bit platform jensen great job explaining real difference ai computing platform accelerator know think computer science world understood moore law end domain specific acceleration way forward obviously big opportunity pointed many company want part type accelerator announced perhaps accelerator like fpgas would like platform frankly pretty far use broader definition jensen pointed look platform right decade 12 15 year saw opportunity lot earlier company investing long time point platform software compatible jet nano largest supercomputer world really disciplined making sure maintain backward compatibility time continue innovate furious pace every year number application growing really rapid pace span multiple domain jensen explained earlier right nobody maturity platform think investment made 10 billion dollar worth investment platform tip spear really ecosystem 1.2 million developer platform partner count total investment nivida platform time got know hundred billion dollar easy someone come point try duplicate right lot important application domain addressing whether scientific computing ai going forward data science performance incredible new domain like ai important industry specific benchmark everybody look compare different option google led effort come set industry benchmark called mlperf recently comprehensive set benchmark good job tough fact lot company part mlperf consortium three four company could even submit result met requirement benchmark pleased nvidia leader six important benchmark beat competition fairly healthy margin show widely adopted platform performance platform artificial intelligence okay value proposition actually understand accelerated computing think understand value proposition compelling able take able accelerate application many fold accelerate application many fold obviously need many server need many server acquisition cost going le need many server energy cost going le hope know datacenters energy cost actually period acquisition cost result know value proposition extremely compelling course machine learning data science latest workload huge opportunity see advantage tco 80 right let talk little bit business model sell sell 2 type product make system line product go 40,000 400,000 stacked rack pod forth work storage partner networking partner develop complete solution customer also take technology market oem partner tesla product line example tesla car go 1,000 10,000 also architecture available every single cloud service provider let talk minute product line business model system couple reason one reason course full stack jensen mentioned going innovate

let go back quickly three segment talked scientific computing hyperscale enterprise tell think opportunity market actually growing quickly scientific computing course beachhead got started proud science ph possible platform moment pride u summit supercomputer fastest supercomputer world fastest supercomputer u already fantastic science done reading article cancer research medical medical research around addiction nuclear energy fusion type thing renewable energy weather prediction fantastic work already done supercomputer also number one supercomputer europe piz daint last summer japan wanted really great ai supercomputer wanted ai supercomputer available industry able use chose nvidia power supercomputer also number application accelerating going accelerate top 15 application important computing scientific computing stage actually accelerate 600 application 450 last year 600 application point almost application account vast majority cycle supercomputing center accelerated nvidia reason market actually going become even larger simulation anymore people want ai time imagine getting answer fast getting scientific result fast use ai predict simulation going get result faster forth every field important domain ai whether precision medicine renewable energy climate weather science important simulation artificial intelligence accelerator domain specific accelerating architecture using product type workload simultaneously problem draw overall tam right next hyperscale leader deep learning training everybody know sometimes get question saturating actually nothing could truth look number amount teraflop per day training done going straight right complexity network developed people want sophisticated ai increasing today people benchmarking training usually mxnet 50 looking well 25 million parameter okay interesting ai going happen around ai assistant need network like automatic speech recognition jasper 200 million parameter bert natural language processing 350 million ph parameter sure getting started question need training going continue increase fact look cudnn downloads continue go mentioned mlperf proof needed better training platform nvidia available every single hyperscale still believe big opportunity u addition training inference starting get traction think going accelerate let tell past people inference lot image could done batch mode idle cpu cycle night example google car roaming street mapping area later want label map name business route well night urgency plenty idle cpu cycle use want type interaction ai assistant like think jensen demonstrated yesterday example microsoft well totally different story ask question first thing go speech text neural network text natural language understanding meaning text context need kind natural language processing network inference done whatever needed get result back search whatever done may display image may need go ahead take put back speech okay get back speech speech sound like robot want sound like robot need another network make sound natural sounding complexity plus okay stuff stuff millisecond useful going wait idle cpu cycle right need gpu acceleration inference going forward big way ai becomes sophisticated inference going big opportunity u example many company already using nvidia inference bytedance know know tiktok started china everywhere short video exploring maybe one fastest growing company use u video moderation make sure content safe nothing would want paypal using u fraud detection billion billion transaction right using technology reduce fraud 10 way talking pretty interesting type fraud people think pretty amazing kind collusion buyer seller fixed store setup people pretty creative find pretty much using technology save 10 going save 10 said use 8x fewer server tco pretty pretty incredible know wechat tencent mean platform absolutely incredible everything lot inference including way end using wechat somebody china natural language understanding provide subtitle native language result really really great lot inference going already people sophisticated inference going think going big opportunity u finally hyperscale enterprise jensen said data science big opportunity unicorn think nvidia platform going able address proper way already cloud provider whether aws sage maker azure ml google ml adopted rapid acceleration platform fair hyperscale feel confident business space going okay finally third segment enterprise new first started working people said leading company starting work deep learning realized hey guy actually already lot data analytics mean everybody talking digitization enterprise know competitive space collect data customer supplier process get business insight extremely competitive world operate far lot open source software right data preparation etl part panda kid learner want accelerate model display graph forth turn open source software already people using frankly able effective enough reason ton data time actually prepare jensen gave example yesterday think verizon network whereby take eight day actually massage data time already current enough even run model forth really need acceleration need nvidia accelerated computing platform working open source whole open source community algorithm making sure sped using rapid actually work interactive way interactive least get result couple hour rather day month really improve start making real difference enterprise data science going huge big opportunity u enterprise space example work deep learning mean great deep learning work done today continental automotive industry example big tier 1 supplier almost major car manufacturer course embarked trying build car great partner using lot dgxs everything data factory deep learning training simulation forth great relationship whereby buy product help setting ï¬‚ow building network driving car one example know many company automotive industry engaged similarly siemens healthineers leader medical diagnostics lot ai expert 40 ai application ready deploy run hundred ai experiment today dgx supercomputer pretty sure every instrument company going follow example wonderful stuff going deep learning space machine learning data analytics data science big opportunity already call light house account early account working understand need improve platform forth uber using gpus match supply rider compared demand sorry supply driver compared demand rider using phrase even though kind talk think customer driver anyway trying match make sure going get picked right time quickly also use ai sorry data analytics machine learning thing like pricing right forth fraud detection thing uber great account working walmart another account excited platform using thing like forecasting imagine walmart largest largest retailer hundred billion dollar business improve forecasting little bit le spoilage something want go one store actually stock impact hundred million dollar need much real time possible today definitely use machine learning day behind information would make much difference excited okay right see evident opportunity segment going larger larger go forward excited next thing want work want make sure easy people adopt technology right easier make buy deploy purchase faster business going grow one key element think ngc ngc really great nvidia gpu cloud started depository container call software hub course 50 plus container hpc application accelerated dl framework many rapid algorithm et cetera many different algorithm wanted simple thing able pull application together make easy people use take use best library optimize full stack containerize put ngc cloud right number going continue grow make easy people go get ai computing

automotive give update strategy guy know strategy automotive platform open platform building autonomous car presentation give update business growing give update market driver driving business thing important give update strategy size opportunity talk progress thing look see whether making progress towards objective okay first term growth lot different growth factor look business couple touch revenue side guess another record year automotive looking much much bigger opportunity thing think would touch highlight something significant past year remember last year investor day launching xavier announced xavier going going said xavier processor power autonomous vehicle power algorithm power cockpit launching know part open platform work literally hundred company sensor tier one car maker truck maker also different vehicle past year basically went zero order 80 company building top xavier platform think one significant thing xavier platform course software compatible previous platform yes people looking drive autonomous vehicle get soon made move previous generation drive xavier platform really important another thing important look past year people started developing xavier different kind vehicle developed using xavier base platform course toyota past year saw announcement yesterday separately individually toyota selected xavier platform announced highlight example interesting volvo selected xavier platform selected level 2 plus level 2 plus translates mass market vehicle nvidia used would seen u mostly robotaxis level 4 type vehicle viewing level 2 plus important first platform engage get soon level 2 plus high function fully featured autopilot solution call drive ap2x number reason level 2 plus became important year talk end spectrum level 2 plus announced robotaxis built using xavier base platform xavier pegasus called development platform xavier announced past year daimler working daimler develop robotaxis solution car ranging level 2 plus robotaxis also different kind autonomous vehicle past year see forklift autonomous forklift developed xavier construction equipment earth mover developed xavier last mile delivery vehicle delivery bot uavs ugv whole world autonomous vehicle developed really brings illustrates fact world autonomous vehicle much bigger u today last year car truck believe every vehicle autonomous reason compelling different every type vehicle every case developed new feature like add usually critical problem something happening autonomous vehicle uniquely solve problem example car course aware 3,000 people die every day world literally 9/11 every day world due human caused accident trucking little bit different problem live amazon era today shortage 60,000 trucker united state expected triple 2026 furthermore electronic logging device required trucker limit amount time drive per day reduces amount productivity brought road driving level 2 plus solution trucker allow trucker extend amount mile drive road amount mile driving resting logged driving time significant changer game changer people industry trucking industry course feeding demand delivery 120 million household united state half 60 million 130 million sorry 65 million household amazon prime subscriber placing demand delivery mobility service robotaxis bus cost ownership entire generation people young adult today want car cost ownership using service lower also footprint planet amount parking lot reduced whole world autonomous vehicle turn thousand accident thousand fatality sorry occur every day related workplace accident 20 accident specifically related construction year saw komatsu announced using xavier develop earth mover look around camera placed earth mover make sure detect worker around make sure harm come forklift delivery bot tractor agriculture country like japan farming become crisis average age farmer japan 67 amount farmer japan going drop dropped half last decade autonomous vehicle help agriculture food production good idea strategic imperative develop result thing seeing projected autonomous vehicle shipment 2025 30,000 heavy truck 750,000 agricultural vehicle 2.5 million commercial robot 1 million 1.1 million uavs okay world autonomous vehicle much bigger address opportunity really address market really three growth opportunity three area nvidia developed platform solution call solution solution really consists number one build computer go vehicle autonomously drive number two train develop deep neural network create algorithm car cockpit well car drive third test validate algorithm make sure vehicle put road safe three individual separate random piece equipment reason nvidia decided build car end end could deeply understand problem process course learned thing essential building autonomous vehicle build deploy test autonomous vehicle without thing need people need turn true end result drive computer side given market dynamic described 25 billion tam opportunity driven short term level 2 plus level 5 3 billion opportunity dgx side term many car maker many car need develop algorithm million million image collect per dnm ph 10 plus dnms ph developed per car math getting started imagine vehicle model car vehicle coming course grow u finally testing validation testing validation really need inaudible accelerate testing validation otherwise going spending hundred billion driving mile hundred year test adequately make sure car working based kind engagement type mile driven believe 2 billion opportunity u high level opportunity specifically couple thing really driving market u past year think aware tesla model 3 became best selling premium car united state car model 3 model s model different model autopilot function tax rate close 80

market next couple year impact think impact thought process thank answer second one first pay respect competition mean stay alert compete competed 120 graphic company company history one point time competed 35 time large company small company quite debt competition looking company incredibly focused incredibly intense leadership way much technical debt much passion business think going remain quite competitive nonetheless always stay alert term growth rate way think couple number inform u one hand recognized pc gaming platform host gaming platform geforce essentially game console game console reasonable price point people head somewhere end life end 300 beginning around 400 500 kind asp head gamer make sense gamer going buy game platform play game case pc good host game console upgrade host several time new game console every couple year buy new geforce imagine paying 300 500 somewhere range something delivers performance much better game console would logical sensible thing informs couple way inform unlike game console largely playing game pc could used esports two type people many way play sport play sport enjoy play sport want win think another way think asp people athlete aspirational athlete really love win need better gear one reason see esports gpus q toshiya hari q aaron rakers jensen huangare like 20 adti want 20 adti want run never missing heartbeat frame per second many gamers click 300 click minute click want make sure get shot next person kind frame rate going miss click buying best gear another reason rest production calue increasing time increase asp increase asp using higher end gpus running much lower voltage much higher end gpus running much lower voltage deliver great performance great innovation really running using silicon way running lower energy eï¬ƒcient point increase asp well production increased production value increase asp increase asp competitive gear increase asp kind factor play game console game console sensibility provides think term ï¬‚oor know number help kind space u dynamic causing asp grow time yes thanks aaron rakers well fargo great presentation think one interesting thing heard idea revenue sharing geforce alliance curious kind first question think proliferation partnership ecosystem thinking term service provider help u understand attribute revenue sharing model think financial perspective one real quick question updated color kind visibility datacenter side would helpful thank sure every country different telco many country eastern europe western europe asia southeast asia latin america india first time able create game platform scale region one billion gamers gamers able reach western china many emerging country would love access pc gaming pc gaming particularly great free play social easy access open want pc anyways need pc anyways lot characteristic pc gaming make vibrant unique using geforce alliance reach buy server u operate network top buy server u operate network top take term relative go subscription model go right beta go subscription model q aaron rakers jensen huangof dollar call 10 month subscription fee maybe keep half keep le half reason bought server operating running network make sense capital investment top bringing network bringing service developing software operating enhancing qos onboarding game marketing nvidia gaming platform get benefit well one thing really great order capture gosh terrible way describing order win new customer economic benefit many know quite significant like time pretty fantastic way differentiate service somebody else service many way see probably enter least one relationship per country larger one maybe two three quite scalable approach one reason built whole stack could nobody else planet built whole system architectured whole server develop software everything one everything one shop course operating service couple year getting quite good second question data center visibility data center visibility data center business grid mind high performance computing high performance computing csp training csp inference csp cloud enterprise computing enterprise computing example data science cloud computing thing quoted today deep learning know well inference jay talked last year kicked fantastic supercomputing know well one way think market industry overlay across monitor intersection everyone grid use market different jay told way going market basically several way one course direct sale cloud service provider second basically high performance convergence computing solution call reference architecture dgx pod reference architecture also go market enterprise partner different way going market track pipeline one get better visibility get lesser visibility example last year little bit le visibility hyperscale data center retrospect realize bought much capital earlier year really really slow know time time found well quarter area le visibility try much pipeline monitor pipeline weekly basis feel pretty good year q john pitzer jensen huang yes john pitzer credit suisse thank presentation couple question one kind one front spent lot time yesterday today really focusing investment software platform ecosystem one competitor place bunch emphasis process technology mine ph node would love hear kind talk sits kind quiver ip maybe talk path question guess term last week clearly demonstrated think interconnect going important going forward data center architecture wondering could make sort comment around memory clearly one competitor looking memory persistent memory perhaps way really lower tco view competitive threat could memory side thing help yes hear u talk process technology packaging technology memory technology reason even though using oftentimes earliest example 3d packaging world first sxm largest chip world make hpm used anybody else reason talk much good buying stuff anybody else find particularly differentiating nanometer available anybody want buy want sell point differentiation point differentiation architecture eï¬ƒciency example fact 2080 ti 2080 turing much energy eï¬ƒcient compared somebody gpu shocking everybody whole point able use something cost effective could cost effective cost eï¬ƒcient get architectural innovation hire engineer tsmc hire engineer building job get eï¬ƒciency silicon purchase goal able deliver best energy eï¬ƒciency best performance best functionality given point time turing crushingly good got measure good one reason great start term data center see u really differentiate course buy best one world largest consumer fact world largest consumer world largest consumer 3d packaging tsmc cowos shipped 3d package anybody talk customer care care functionality get eï¬ƒciency get performance get tco ultimately get care focus order overcome slowing moore law order overcome dramatic way mean improve 10 want overcome overcome cpu 10 might well wait next cpu accelerated computing requires software optimization would x factor mean 10x q mark lipacis jensen huang q mark lipacis jensen huangfactor fair amount work 600 plus application framework deep learning neural network model accelerate engineer worked really really hard ecosystem everybody working super hard pervasiveness cuda nobody would lift finger different mapreduce hadoop essentially announced called rapid accelerated hadoop think way okay hadoop come memory called apache ph memory top called rapid rapid way think rapid essentially mapreduce except accelerated gpus well build unless great deal computer science expertise nvidia differentiation addressing percentage share market someone else created company always talking new market creating new market tends ten hundred billion dollar large industry ca unless go reshape come new algorithm ca build faster ship alone hi mark lipacis jefferies thanks lot presentation hi mark found accelerated computing platform framework vision particularly compelling seems like customer biggest customer also use lexicon platform also lot resource wondering could help u maybe share u framework thinking frame platform customer developing nvidia platform customer platform sitting top nvidia platform sitting next nvidia platform let say 5 10 year line thank yes excellent reason mark look look across x two square horizontal platform case customer partner partner ecosystem partner would tend jigsaw puzzle interweave part platform stick part platform stick accelerate part platform okay let give example case cloud machine learning platform like google machine learning cloud aws sagemaker microsoft azure ml okay case xgboost library stick way top rapid essentially modern version accelerated version mapreduce go way top cudf basically like panda one user spark data center cudf basically like spark accelerated pipeline ph ecosystem cuml basically psychic learn okay platform go way top case many case like tensorflow tensor core architecture tensor core amp basically cudnn cuda cudnn tensor amp stick deeply integrated tensorflow see tensor flow depends way come try create platform ecosystem prefers another platform supplier approach would integrate one exist one never exist example write rapid mapreduce gpu accelerated data center would never exists nobody nobody know nobody nobody engineer nobody go much work mapreduce sitting top yarn sitting top hadoop complicated stuff gpu accelerate beyond comprehension nobody going go go took four year go first part platform like data science integrate depending like okay google stuff sticking notice rapid virtual machine google cloud platform machine learning sits next tensorflow case sagemaker rapid integrate sagemaker inaudible case azure vast majority take okay one answer second answer vertical market like example large scale medical imaging computational software defined medical instrument future medical imaging multi modality image reconstruction ai visualization segmentation 2d 3d multiple disease multiple sensor modality created platform one exist planet call clara would integrate platform partner example ge medical imaging platform good siemens excellent one sony part canon toshiba philip lot integrate clara piece integrate nuance text annotation standard practically radiologist okay clara example also gave drive example developed whole stack top bottom everything open somebody would like use simulation platform physic platform rather car physic simulator example ipg delighted plug somebody would like visualization physic simulation would like somebody else traï¬ƒc ai simulator cognata delighted plug create apis platform ecosystem could adapt positive way thinking way think course would like enable ecosystem shape platform way like use okay benefit u course central part ecosystem look transportation ecosystem every day go people stuff company whether buying chip car buying chip car development system sometimes built development system chip car sometimes software car well kind way working people q timothy arcuri jensen huang q timothy arcuri jensen huangso mark answer nothing powerful platform platform reach nvidia ecosystem sticky platform sticky people platform integrated platform platform also together helping ecosystem helping industry move forward okay simplistically hi tim arcuri ubs thanks two question first gaming jensen read lot website sort talk fact gamers playing aaa game pretty old monitor three old monitor think maybe whether display technology becomes ramp gate fast turning might ramp number one number two term manufacturability already radical ph limited lot design think combat move chiplet design intel already sort moving direction talk thank sure vast majority world gamers currently 1080p first thing want world market given resolution case 1080p first thing wanted get 1080p want increase frame rate within 1080p want increase frame rate want increase beauty image 1080p okay increasing frame rate seeing smoothly reducing latency 100 frame per second much much lower latency 30 right 30 frame per second 33 millisecond quite large number millisecond world competitive sport within 1080p achieve 100 frame per second visual fidelity option turned next thing would like go next resolution 1440p go 1440p everything get cut half got double got increase graphic processor could start getting frame rate back meanwhile added ray tracing going keep making gaming experience better every two three year resolution monitor kind click another 2x next one 4k right people 1440p find monitor obstacle know mentioned four factor monitor resolution latency frame rate visual fidelity new feature got really great new feature coming sorry second question turned 56 like point inaudible oh yes right chiclets think chiclets good yummy like orange version question actually reticle limit reticle limit colette kress q timothy arcuri colette kress q timothy arcuri colette kress q timothy arcuri jensen huangpascal p100 near reticle limit volta reticle limit volta reticle limit reason invented nvlink could take 16 gpus reticle limit connect altogether okay number one limit 3d technical diï¬ƒculty fitted one node matter big node find way connect smart interconnect reason decide technical diï¬ƒculty technical diï¬ƒculty unit growth total probably announce work rest year sorry inventory ï¬‚ush q1 q2 yes indicated one two quarter starting back november would work overall inventory mean end quarter second quarter one two quarter get q1 q2 starting back started november got end q1 done correct thank stacy ph might might may assumption quite right clear gpu every price point one confusion created price point 1070 2070 impression two number always price somehow bmw 5 series would exactly price history time unfortunately possible 1070 higher price 970 970 higher price 570 people paying much attention day nobody paid attention past number number u past become number society little bit like three series five series seven bit gotten kind notoriety think partly surprised gpu every price point gpu 299 399 499 599 like four every single price point way better people buying 45 simple answer could q ambrish srivastava colette kressall asp lot unit asp go far simple answer yes mean simple answer yes hi ambrish bmo colette question think gross margin year wanted go back especially context qualitatively talked positive impact crypto business gave u delta inventory 300 bps improvement think year right way think gross margin trajectory little bit talk op margin focus get margin opex kind growing line said consistently would investing business going margin front mix right way think thank think gross margin move forward moving conversation gaming look range overall gross margin business see people upgrade upgrade higher higher overall gpu help u term overall op margin additionally think overall datacenter business know significant amount software incorporated platform sell opportunity improve overall gross margin datacenter business becomes larger percentage business whole let forget overall automotive business continuing transition overall infotainment business move ai within cockpit move overall development service working think overall production piece well thing continue change mix selling overall improve overall gross margin okay focus focus term opex focusing opex nature question meaning term total ph piece current year take look yearly basis say appropriate amount spend great opportunity front u need make sure properly invested uniqueness unified architecture probably get spend term opex going forward model say look opex percentage revenue little bit massive company number focus actually look workload going take u get work done focus term redeploying even internal headcount towards project better utilize workforce greater thing right would look always keep opex front center key area investment keep mind term focusing operating profit term produce best overall profit leverage q matthew ramsay jensen huangwell two thing keep mind rather absolute overall opex opex percentage revenue hey matt ramsay cowen couple question guess first jensen guy made bid mellanox last week big secret couple folk also involved bid think guy came bit late wonder could give u little bit update industry partner reaction intending acquire business step making keep infiniband standard open colette maybe could talk u little bit infrastructure group may putting place monitor inventory level across business across channel may getting little bit le granular information geforce software stack gpus actually activated gaming whatever infrastructure put place monitor inventory update would helpful thank super excited mellanox decided accept offer wow competitive reason unique company 20 year making 100 focus computing network software stack integrated computing software stack world know building computing system great company work lot expertise also highlight look press release system built seem company aside u mentioned actually kind interesting reason engineer work datacenters software engineering necessary get performance lowest latency processing best performance uploading necessary data structure moved around distributed computing day really really complicated stuff really super special company customer industry delighted delighted really feel important company going well cared hand understand computer architecture computer architecture question system architecture question chip question component question architecture

currently described future 10 15 year working time okay thing really love company ability one hand execute incredibly well today work realize dream tomorrow start explore day find right balance love working management team simona jankowski jensen huang q mitchell steves jensen huang think time one last question sure oh boy pressure high sir yeah thanks mitch steves rbc want turn back gaming really two question first good hear turing launch gone well beginning get comfortable guess around content increase going forward without visibility kind game made secondly recall couple year ago really emphasized vr unit opportunity asp notice kind like topical guessing wondering kind unit opportunity going forward since asp somewhere around 2020 opportunity yeah great let see absolutely certain certain ray tracing last question total control said simona said number one reason question ray tracing right answer always right answer using mimicking physical behavior light physical modeling light computer graphic issue ray tracing never right answer elegant answer simpler answer true computationally intensive found way use hybrid rendering approach half rasterization ray tracing rtx mean mix mode rasterization ray tracing invented technology invented approach evangelized ecosystem world saw thing happened microsoft directx r vulkanrt engine built top epic engine 4.22 dxr ready rtx ready unity next build coming april 4 also rtx dxr ready engine game industry operating system game industry engine work fast use work use invent use toolkit question mind going happen absolutely certain okay game keep coming game keep coming come almost monthly cadence several hundred game year know include mention china whole bunch game korea bunch game made lot game made question year time ray tracing literally everywhere conversation worthwhile capture year time come back gosh right simona jankowskiit last question humor sir second question oh vr talk vr much vr really really still important particularly work microsoft hololens industrial design professional market two u really great work vr used industrial design place styling architectural engineering important part
