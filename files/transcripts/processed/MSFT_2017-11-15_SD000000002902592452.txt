okay go ahead get everyone seated keep going know starting get late afternoon okay feel like house like talking kid okay going go ahead get started everyone want get seated welcome takeshi numoto stage happy takeshi u microsoft charge one well corporate vice president cloud enterprise obviously really transformed entire story microsoft picked coverage microsoft think 2002 hambrecht quist/jpmorgan right beginning covering software group completely different story still talking nt prepping oﬃce 2003 cycle different thing still extent informs bit piece story takeshi team done cloud enterprise side transform entire technology industry lucky today go story going read safe harbor comment begin microsoft may make statement presentation refer sec filing risk factor relating business true whether person listening web web thank well joining u welcome takeshi thanks much coming question answer q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt guess like start got detailed question maybe talk spending time specifically got wide purview got one exciting business microsoft cut across lot different product area focused right top priority inform thinking strategy business general well first great thanks focus priority standpoint committed growing server cloud revenue double digit saw 17 growth q1 led lot cloud growth azure something want continue go drive mentioned nt back day company 20 year amazing privilege part amazing journey started engineer window nt current role corporate vice president cloud enterprise marketing basically responsible sort azure window server sql server product go server cloud bucket well dynamic business application get reported part productivity space external reporting segment standpoint role six year prior worked oﬃce oﬃce 365 least last 10 year feel like working cloud cloud cloud driving cloud growth long journey amazing want start azure move server dynamic thinking day day right spending time excuse sorry sneezing little bit spending time customer point trying still proselytize azure story term spending time recently think feel like sort lot running back forth mean running front line customer partner engagement last week spent week road probably met 30 40 partner customer series week still continuing really get sense really happening front line customer partner engagement time come back corporate spending lot time development team thinking road map business strategy role really sort cause go back forth lot right thinking sort partner ecosystem evolved get specifically azure question different partner model mean remember back day think 600,000 takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numotoreseller channel one microsoft core strength azure story cloud story partner different story red hat talking embedding cloud service openshift whole different set possibility respect partner ecosystem story use case evolving really getting traction mind share ecosystem well think every customer journey cloud unique lot effort spanning broad range area sort meet sometimes customer want basically sort think appending cloud capability already might around adding monitoring management backup disaster recovery using azure secondary site might sort basic first step may customer customer really thinking much rearchitecting application deploying azure azure stack want deployment ﬂexibility seeing extreme large portion middle customer really thinking migrating workload azure try meet essentially making kind migration workload maybe technology azure migrate service help customer migrate virtual machine also working partner solution well database migration service enables customer migrate database azure technology investment making also making sort think business model investment help customer transition example azure hybrid benefit benefit offer customer software assurance software license estate software assurance annuity customer window server example give substantial discount actually saving 40 basically run window server virtual machine azure combined migration benefit term technology deliver also business benefit whether sort appending azure sort prem estate rearchitecting application sort migration existing workload want solution work really hard meet customer think mix use case reason ask think people still perceive happening azure lot new workload development maybe lift shift maybe much point true starting see migration work yes like 3 pattern mentioned 3 growing think overall customer journey cloud like overall journey market think still early inning 3 type use case growing right want continue address also seeing even sort would refer sort migration kind workload bigger q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holtworkloads come azure might ask let say two year ago may many customer engagement around let say dev test erp estate example today seeing largest customer move production safety workload azure getting migrated becoming bigger substantial also driving growth well say seeing production workload sap move azure yes really really ... sap like example big workload lot consumption associated said ca really think maybe trading application many example application would complex sap erp application interesting think customer reference scalability location proximity really driving well think sort hard attribute one factor conﬂuence many thing think increasing openness confidence customer use cloud cloud journey becoming familiarized comfortable vector maturity side customer side vendor side also like think increasing recognition cloud place really realize high agility sort dynamic change need people think technology cloud becomes much mainstream conversation dialogue view mean sap large sap workload azure really limitation migrate azure environment takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt certainly would conversation customer `` hi really take big workload thing like erp sap good example know used sap example seeing technical limitation thing oracle thing big industry application whether isv application work isvs like temenos banking application run azure like said increasing repertoire example highly big workload coming azure okay environment maybe walk typical example going using typically infrastructure service going typically migrating database going typically using adjunct platform service building connectivity application data service would walk u maybe example would look like practice usage perspective like said cloud journey unique every customer move major workload definitely lot adjacency get pulled move core workload well core workload lot data sits cloud natural next step customer think essentially applying lot data technology analytics data resides cloud data adjacency often see also kind core application bring lot adjacent system whether expense report system surround core application actually often new application get built whether mobile application hand stuff like core workload adjacency effect something seeing take step back look azure growth trajectory general sort tough question many different input pace outgrow aws similar scale biggest difference appear one positioning around hybrid two positioning around premium service discussing ability move sap oracle workload ongoing workload cloud principal factor view driving higher growth takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto well certainly think leadership enterprise space certainly key factor helping u developed product really enterprise mind way way deploy region azure 42 region announced azure cloud vendor part want address enterprise customer need able deploy application data close place consumption need also deal regulatory environment data residency requirement often certainly enterprise focus leadership position enterprise key factor mentioned hybrid obviously another big factor vendor starting talk consistently start initially think hybrid end state go hybrid end cloud think transitionary state actually think hybrid state state long haul may heard satya talk intelligent cloud intelligent edge believe computing becomes ever ubiquitous computing becomes powerful cloud also edge asset cloud provider player also deliver software essentially work harmoniously service provide cloud enable new scenario key differentiator also think product like azure stack getting lot customer interest feeling really sort bullish approach taking u hybrid connectivity colo really providing consistent platform customer whether around identity platform management plane data technology really consistent platform think key requirement customer move forward okay may unfair question look cloud customer percentage would say leveraging microsoft premise technology well certainly enterprise space think find enterprise customer microsoft technology maybe let scope differently using microsoft data center technology talking somebody might using oﬃce window desktop side talking somebody using microsoft server microsoft sql microsoft biztalk something traditional data center stack leveraging azure service customer q adam hathaway holt takeshi numotowell think enterprise think find enterprise customer window server may use mix estate might high low lot customer high mix think often pretty feel give u good engagement point talk customer even use small portion estate okay thinking way azure business change position application business mean one question get time see press new application built built c built .net know true see press lot seems like azure ability kind reintermediate microsoft newer application developed easier run maybe nonnative application azure footprint run application built specifically window server true well certainly looking meet developer like many front azure perspective point 40 virtual machine running azure data center today basically linux virtual machine would certainly personally expect number go move forward operating system work really hard made lot progress supporting variety open source operating system language framework whether node python r database service like managed database service postgraph mysql today announcing joined maria db foundation offer maria db managed service well operating system also language framework data technology supporting essentially onboard many developer possible meet bring skill use favorite tech available use azure also extending capability like .net across platform hope know .net already available across platform open sourced tremendous amount community energy poured onto also extended reach developer tool think developer tool visual studio code something people giving u great feedback development environment top linux mac developer actually helping u reach developer fact number active developer using visual studio expanded significantly across front basically much embracing broader set developer goal onboarding azure service level language level like open sourcing .net also extending tool far ground one cloud concerned driving consumption really top inaudible lead people room maybe call standpoint might sort characterize patent expansion sense saying `` hi linux customer os database mongodb customer cassandra customer would anything sell support mongodb cassandra apis cosmos db q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holtsorts language framework harness azure could characterize tam expansion yes mean kind point seems like positioning business completely changed addition functional change term product deliver delivery model change also put different place technology development process one deal worked qatalyst sold xamarin quite sort idea reaching broader base mobile application developer going back something said 40 virtual machine running running azure linux number go think development sorry adoption open source something something specific driving number actually higher number thought actually sound like think go even higher would expect inch time yes think think big use case virtual machine well lot os workload often also fundamentally term architecture tends spawn virtual machine consumption grows opposed use bigger profitable virtual machine customer running trying think revenue opportunity like would much rather make 10 dollar able monetize like said cassandra mongodb may first choice first choice would cosmos well cosmos support apis ... think terrific strategy economics change somebody running linux virtual environment mean term revenue opportunity set versus somebody might running window environment running window stack instead linux stack change takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt well term think additive economic opportunity people offer service service consumption get monetized cloud right guess trying quantify spend taking customer spending 10 microsoft stack could get 2 somebody running linux stack azure oh know like necessarily think conversion right left saying additive trying quantify additive could think quote number know interested chris okay got try well got agree additive really ... yes said would much rather see get 10 getting dollar think much better play totally different positioning story within azure cloud workload moving microsoft point point b moving microsoft point point b also putting microsoft front point c able move point d. mean getting linux different thing could touch otherwise platform longer issue point really matter language build totally different whole argument hey new application built c garbage seeing basically growing community .net takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numotoyes okay got terrific well important think getting big referenceable application customer onto azure specifically work done adobe well publicized google salesforce deal google far understand really first referenceable big application cloud application vendor run gcp important get kind company onto azure think getting application particularly business large business application onto azure incredibly important ﬂywheel effect business estate deposited cloud essentially creates gravity data application certainly important example like sap one mentioned adobe great example continuing work enlisting isv partnership bring application azure migrate either isv run azure use adobe example know many others somebody move sap know lot work workload azure would fall category premium service well depends resource basically definition premium service thing beyond basically raw compute storage could management service security service could database service managed nature managed database service sql postgraph managed nosql service like cosmos db iot fall premium bucket right really classification around premium defined either scale app required ... type resource type would say got look portfolio premium use case think satya get asked question look every conference call tends talk ai tends talk cosmos guess 2 question think scale premium service relative whole 5 business 10 business secondarily ... q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holtyou asking number ca give think chris ask speak sorry phone going reminding ask question ca answer okay well trying get sense mean another way ask question probably wo able give either term magnitude growth way talk would really help u size possible sort characterize well 20 growth coming premium service something along line think thing really remember u externally talking premium service basically 13 consecutive quarter growth well azure near growth growing rapid rate certainly premium service outgrowing sort overall azure bit respect service popular ai iot cosmos one said satya talk second generation think going become next two year popular think one listed continue big driver premium growth one might mention would management security service growing think thing like enterprise mobility suite enterprise mobility security based adfs capability offer active directory delivering premium capability device management capability application management capability think also see lot synergy company customer picking vendor view strategic partner cloud journey azure discussion really microsoft cloud discussion think journey think see increasingly customer thinking think holistically boding well u think fortune 500 company talk 90 customer using microsoft cloud perhaps one really get excited even 90 number fact 60 company using 3 service notion really picking vendor support journey cloud across saas across paas across iaa think customer want think put u really nice place management security side mentioned enterprise mobility think everything need identity front takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt mean never worked product additional request customer always need product okay okay going shift got minute left turn audience going shift talk little bit premise business maybe finish couple question dynamic time business continues strong love idea symbiotic relationship cloud extent offering cloud credit cloud discount helping perpetuate strength sole factor think driving kind steady growth think still gaining share done math would suggest actually increasing average selling price still maybe walk u element growth story people tend think cloud tie think may see variety dynamic going certainly like value proposition around hybrid definitely helping u whether technical side term product work together business synergy bringing bear customer like azure hybrid benefit mentioned also think place feel like taking share key workload whether feel like sql great value proposition customer think value prop bring give oltp bi advanced analytics machine learning built single product feel like tremendous market momentum also available linux think amount customer basically starting try product based number like docker hub pool measure seeing tremendous amount interest bodes well aspiration go grow business even another aspect essentially sort strength think think pinion mix customer really think journey cloud want basically environment premise compatible cloud lead virtualization higher density use workload even translates sale strength thing like window server data center addition sql server enterprise addition would call premium aspect premium mix lever helping sustain health premise business help certainly premium story chart initiation looked sort value get server steadily increased enabling mean thing people seem willing pay debate takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holtbundled versus actually increase value see sort 1 2 piece functionality actually causing people upgrade premium service like said basically use technology sort make environment compatible cloud like higher density virtualization bigger hardware core necessitates basically cover core lead premium sale factor okay got azure stack mentioned earlier said good early demand market month right yes early day sure something going show mean thinking business bolster mean going show server side side show cloud side see think great question sort also illuminates focused really driving server cloud double digit like technically speaking azure stack think feature azure buy azure stack deploy way charge consumptive mean customer spool virtual machine resource paas service available could use app service could use container service azure stack build customer azure build even though hardware sits pay go essentially customer really want basically get reported cloud revenue customer really want able use technology disconnected state business model address sell kind disconnected state way show server revenue externally product product term deliver sort depending customer consume mean new product want get overly enthusiastic seem get lot airtime particularly ray team absolutely love thinking ramp kind product fiscal story really going take couple quarter get channel getting selling motion something different release could faster respect impact takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt q unidentified participant takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt kind feel like little early tell customer buzz reaction customer also partner ask hardware partner think really pleased sort action seeing bullish think little early day awesome let trying think stop take question ﬂoor hit dynamic question question think going couple got one pink question azure win versus aws see gcp mix right think google trying differentiate ai tensorflow competitive competitive response microsoft okay term win guess one seeing sort biggest differentiation resonates resonating customer basically enterprise focus leadership whether sort engagement customer sort trust microsoft cloud vendor help deal regulatory compliance security requirement enterprise customer think sort one big one hybrid talked another one looking way sort synergistically use essentially use cloud synergistic way opposed sort second one would also say notion productivity big one customer increasingly looking use cloud like really need leading edge set developer broader set developer organization productive using cloud whether devops capability service offer thing like visual studio team service thing visual studio extend reach every developer whatever skill set whatever preference technology apply technology productive way azure think really resonating one call asked see google lot lying say see say compare year ago see lot see run time time sure changed whole lot term ai sort technology lot investment bringing bear year investment made microsoft azure showing place like cognitive service offer azure also support thing like tensorflow azure run really well area continue compete furiously also seeing really interesting use case azure make u pretty bullish q unidentified participant takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holta question left conference morning ubs talked excited azure stack talking term future perhaps suggesting still waiting couple feature part development order accelerate spending kind thing roadblock current roadblock thing developed accelerate azure stack term exploration azure stack mean first aspect hardware partner product available yet already available market mean think already azure stack basically purchasable 47 country really enables great coverage hybrid got get partner product available working aspect azure service run azure stack portfolio get richer time already paas service like container service app service available write application common way public cloud azure azure stack want continue add portfolio time question got couple question dynamic okay one thing think sort set driver dynamic business one fact application business globally seems better mean better oracle better sap good salesforce seems bit tailwind plus got 365 story tell talk one believe agree first premise application market feel little bit better two 365 accelerant actually showing market sure like mean like application market seems mean like azure growing great instead want say one think customer think journey cloud one increased appetite seeing customer willingness sort say `` hi app deploy rather custom one like app basically solution bodes well sort paas business application certainly seeing dynamic 365 growing grew 68 69 forgot exact number basically around 70 q1 certainly aided customer appetite essentially business application served cloud dynamic business point upgrading older version real new business done takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto q adam hathaway holt takeshi numoto new new true seeing lot appetite cloud think new dynamic customer q1 believe 3 4 customer chose cloud mean lot lot lot linkedin touchpoints dynamic year think actually practice linkedin integration think either impacted win rate revenue trajectory business yes dynamic standpoint seen really good synergy essentially call relationship microsoft relationship sale solution offer combine dynamic 365 sale linkedin seen customer like infosys realize really great benefit essentially really adopting relationship selling selling process course integrate something like sale navigator linkedin dynamic 365 thing like make sure find people within organization give warm intro lead opposed trying cold test customer seeing substantial reduction essentially sale cycle improvement win rate offering quite new customer interest quite high feeling pretty bullish also increasing linkedin integration essentially hr front dynamic 365 talent essentially integrates linkedin recruiter another area feel like deliver additional value customer okay time thank much coming useful thank much thanks
