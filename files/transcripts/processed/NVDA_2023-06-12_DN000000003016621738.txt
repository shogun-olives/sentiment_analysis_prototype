hi everybody good afternoon good evening thanks attending discussion comparing ph future mobility pleasure welcome ali nvidia vice president general manager automotive business automotive product line overseeing product engineering marketing also drive platform nvidia developing introduced automotive industry year ali going give u like quick presentation like intro perspective q always want pas straight q feel free email question best introduce integrate ﬂow question ask ali ali thanks lot joining ﬂoor hi everyone pleasure today talk guy nvidia automotive product strategy going jump sort say guy know everything talking today subject disclosure statement financial statement talk risk uncertainty provides detail within going jump talk nvidia strategy slide really cornerstone make nvidia unique automotive instead providing product service support partner automotive ecosystem sort say mean people need design car nvidia solution help customer design car train ai model simulate av stack use drive omniverse help customer build automotive factory design automotive factory also build retail configurator engineering side use omniverse help people synthetic data generation sort augment data real ﬂeet synthetic data av product better sort set u apart sort actually selling chip car go build selling platform development partner always thinking make easier partner develop requirement create tool software service accelerate ﬂow said many time company best development ﬂow fastest company successful automotive hard build sort level 4 level 5 software build sort concierge experience inside car ai know everything know everything car sort talk sort build end time framework make lifecycle better better customer differentiated nvidia versus player system kind show think ecosystem like oems say oh oem want work entire ecosystem software company building av software showing slide point nvidia designed best platform anyone build software platform take learning development guy know also build av software cockpit software many partner building av software cockpit software platform take learning entire ecosystem put platform industry share benefit thing simulation simulation option drive sim drive sim actually apis entire validation ecosystem hook platform accelerate intent development cycle thing notice quite successful across stack customer building nevs happened play majority platform partnership many major tier 1 eight largest robotaxi also truck company partnership mapping company simulation company point across ecosystem buying product large looking ecosystem partner take advantage ev development show guy product roadmap inside car think key point want stress need av constantly increasing compute requirement even close solved sensor resolution growing complexity network people developing car growing sophistication people building bev transformer car customer trying build like single model almost like say large language model like av network car situation like need programmable architecture know algorithm want use want ﬂexible able change rapidly product performance growing significantly ensure apis cuda cuda apis tensorrt apis architecturally compatible like sku sku ph across generation storage software compatible oriented software compatible xavier customer take car could essentially imagine someone take orin car take orin computer swap thor computer software run performance headroom able create new software service life car platform building automotive think one trend want talk lived world every new service feature car solved new computer car past getting point people 100 computer car happens super hard program super hard sort improve experience maintain ensure security car supercritical see industry moving towards centralization multiple computer integrated unified one central computer thor designed taking lot innovation data center talk sort thing like gpu essentially mean thor actually like multiple compute cluster inside run one application one keep separate another data center technology innovation nvidia put car reason fundamentally generation car truly data center wheel call get benefit innovation infrastructure able pull vehicle roadmap value customer solution sort program eﬃciently life car range electric vehicle better sort integrate vehicle one core architecture value customer beyond programmability also lower power one thing wanted talk huge investment platform strategy guy kind see talk ecosystem platform huge investment software care increasing installed base platform excited partnership announced mtk mediatek essentially gpus cuda tensorrt get integrated socs automotive customer want use tab access cuda tensorrt drive software operating system middleware q pierre ferragu ali kanithe application software built support platform software platform ecosystem advantage beginning chiplet essentially sort gave access mediatek available partner ecosystem automotive point platform valuable huge part investment software huge part investment cuda tensorrt sort increase scale installed base platform better industry holding expanding footprint jump away slide slide give guy picture pipeline announced pipeline 14 billion next six year show pipeline ramp sort take look slide mean xpan neo ph ramped production time start see new hyundai kia model ramp start see polestar line start see sort nevs spike lucid byd start ramp see mercedes jaguar land rover know automotive win announced start ramp many year future pipeline give sense sort value win system take time ramp kind show pipeline ramp ramp time slide open q question answer thanks ali thanks slide thanks bringing like broader perspective like pilot drive platform much chip car useful maybe like focus first two question better understanding helping investor understanding like drive product strategy translates term business model sell mostly chip think like revenue split automotive division actually going make like money make selling chip like minority overall revenue opportunity yeah let try summarize type product someone buy chip chip asp software asp always even drive operating system go production need safe revenue operating system safe license go stack customer might say want build entire stack want l2 plus l3 software q pierre ferragu ali kani q pierre ferraguthose case value software grow larger value hardware depends customer want one thing talked architecture designed modular take want look slide partner ramp note vast majority take chip operating system middleware full stack full stack partner like jaguar land mercedes point u open whatever best partner layer software service based need aggregate end somewhere middle someone wanted u software work value software value hardware thing product right like someone want drive sim synthetic data generation case software right giving access simulate software using stimulate av experience thing someone wanted hybrid product like ovx constellation people buy hardware like replica orin thor would car could x86 cpu discrete gpus customer architect robotaxis like want drive sim software would software revenue top really depends one thing many product start hardware actually case customer could buy hardware u pay software drive sim could actually license software use hardware kind run gamut think one thing consistent across stack actually software okay helpful multiple speaker u yeah helpful mentioned know important like ecosystem aspect aiming platform like nvidia product open broad ecosystem third party question wondering open also ecosystem term hardware kind answered question already partly like push bit client choose like board hardware nvidia use nvidia elsewhere thinking question likey let talk tesla well known large client nvidia run amongst larger gpu cluster worldwide ali kani q pierre ferragu ali kaniownership inaudible pretty sure ca comment specifically nvidia yes tell u open altentative hardware nvidia help oem choose like mobileye moto qualcomm another solution board still want nvidia road ph yeah open great question way think explains strategy partner actually think sort partner many case customer use computer car really important customer u cloud gave example tesla help tesla training simulating av model using hardware cloud use u car perfectly fine great thing great customer architect stack totally fine course someone used car someone used cloud like advantage like train cuda tensorrt cloud apis algorithm developed actually run inference car always train gpus cloud change exact architecture mobileye qualcomm car perfectly fine many case open supportive way would say want help partner regardless use u many layer software perfectly fine right someone may say want help simulation yes using someone else would say great let u talk help simulation give synthetic data generation help retail configurator help training software software mobileye cloud great opportunity u open architect like thing kind mentioned hinted course case someone say well love access capability car want buy chip way could sort license thing car put soc answer course yes announced mediatek right yeah fine want access capability put car could competitor could oem would happy sort give access gpu let build solution car course help cloud based q pierre ferragu ali kani q pierre ferragu ali kani q pierre ferragu ali kani q pierre ferragu yeah okay useful going ask like really tough question one mentioned like 14 billion 16 billion pipeline imagine want inaudible wondering know split sideline split like hardware software platform full stack operating system middleware comment way yeah think let answer slightly differently feel like pipeline kind saw way showed saw full stack customer end forecast period right majority see customer sort skew soc lower software revenue like said scale full stack number larger soc kind answering like kind say average across six year think customer base end wanting mix pipeline true partner software revenue larger hardware revenue okay move lot big one last question like like oem customer partner like training like simulation cluster would data center client end day typically customer recognizing division customer like sitting data center division yeah okay way would answer first recorded data centre cloud infrastructure reported data center actually internal business unit like run business actually manage within automotive team constantly working together right talking customer car talk cloud time internally manage one business keep simple investor community choose take cloud put data center revenue okay logic applies pipeline pipeline talk always pipeline revenue reported domestic division yeah ph okay great thanks clarification let ask one question look broader like passenger car opportunity really nvidia tesla mobileye ali kani q pierre ferragu ali kanitoday tesla integrated everything house mobileye offering package open bit time offering apis customization opportunity clearly need market like like open player question think potentially creating dependency adoption technology offer open environment mean oems one reason choose want develop technology make system integration unfortunately know sometimes company struggle good job might end delaying technology set going give name heard news ﬂow like large car manufacturer throwing initiative actually failing deliver see risk open strategy versus offering turnkey solution oem client first let sort say remember strategy yes customer want sort someone build full stack case course deliver solution might someone want slight want really building software also taking software u case customer say going build full stack want develop hardware think risk risk oem want take aligned strategy would say started mobileye like point case customer say strategy want force u take perception software want build course u okay time partner work like way case mobileye customer taking good chunk stack would never risk really oem want support value approach customer challenge later come say help u let say wanted everything aligned hyperion architecture actually come later say oh yeah like could like problem parking give parking stack developed platform opportunity u help risk come fruition course even something q pierre ferragu ali kani q pierre ferragu ali kani q pierre ferraguenvision beginning case partner come u later say hey harder thought help u case like yeah happy help sort add software offering provide okay see trend market would say like oems like moving towards like integrated approach want nvidia would say oem strategy oem strategy able competency house like mean like next sop mean 15 year future think oems feel like software run car something responsible happens lot investment oems making right electrification ﬂeet car cockpit software av software make investment time actually hire team function try partner place help think everyone want able well let say think seen far harder anyone imago believe going see oem short term think going partnering future production team ramped could imagine horizon oem might ability able something proven training thing take okay interesting even see maybe trend coming back ask stack ambition still able develop internal competency great yeah ambition absolutely right think every oem want able think saying lot harder people think happens hard predict sort telling think like 20 year good going try sneak like two last question training ph might bit challenging first one work nvidia show cost base nvda especially like bill material basis competitive hardware car vision chip competitive ali kani q pierre ferragu ali kanimobileye morning really talked cost competitiveness ben stronger like underlying driver strong market share today deployed also underline confidence strong market position going forward like would say total system cost 3,000 4,000 slice actual electronics semiconductor part cost 1,000 2,000 tell u like cost positioning nvidia course diﬃcult question open ecosystem like really card ph think competitiveness cost kind future basis yeah would sort say two thing one focus l2+ l2+ higher believe every entry car l2+ time like going see shift software service opportunity ﬂeet building l2+ car position cost perspective competitive kind see right really building l2+ car industry tesla outside tesla like bunch chinese oems volvo mercedes jaguar land rover guy really building l2+ vehicle see share successful market price performance positioning nvidia quite good segment far sensor stack go strategy unique like shown hyperion architecture architecture scalable l3 configuration people say want build single orin computer camera radar cost sensor cost cost computer low people building system l2+ market really attractive price think positioning good scalable make sense scalable good l2+ good l3 good l4 scale certainly need lidar need camera couple radar architecture sport thing customer platform choose sensor set deliver software customer say hey want even sensor set able architecture quite successful never force sensor set actually come sensor set use wish okay clear last question would talked mostly like passenger car opportunity robotaxi like driverless experience one question based project team entire different level view past side option see first like significant rollouts vehicle timeline well q pierre ferragu ali kani q pierre ferraguokay first say think find couple city well sort green light trial need see successful already seeing city could night robotaxi allowed operate turn proving safer driver real world think see rollout commercial good delivery one car transporting good one place think see adoption start think whole industry need super cautious need super responsible rush anything know even one accident kind become big deal industry believe take time get early success need take time make sure right expect like passenger car decade much harder problem unrestricted undefined could anywhere think take longer technology better human need even much better human know human make accident sympathetic ai make accident think little bit le sympathetic think trial starting next year two certain city think sort l4 true consumer car next decade could even take longer depends could get really ca make mistake super super charging way need validation simulation ca multiple speaker help partner think come even better way stimulate scenario could possibly happen make sure safe ali would like spend like two hour stretching year fantastic opportunity industry unfortunately already time thank much making time participating comparison bringing perspective perspective nvidia hope stay touch thank thanks
