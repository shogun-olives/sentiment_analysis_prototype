deploying correctly order deploy correctly need solid data analysis behind behind going ca come shell app start disseminating single messaging way would mass medium think put strategy together behind behind program like going beyond say apps technology think think total program yes minimum requirement know think app really going back time maybe 1998 internet started really take hold really every business started build webpage sort right really way getting getting game making presence known online right similar thing apps right need need able app really engine behind going decide whether sustainable whether going replaced another app road minimum requirement really think successful say app mean first know user experience easy need ordering component payment component need enable loyalty necessarily structured loyalty loyalty huge buzzword right loyalty term thought airline structured program forth traditionally mean making sure get get information customer act loyalty need careful using sword also robust customer table right put together know engine behind minimum good solid information customer start thinking really complete solution really get depth data able collect sign information customer customer actually able collect meaningful user data right people coming dine multiple mean future contact right know loyalty app instance single purpose way got communicate people loyalty app know really know really limiting potential target people different stage decision decision journey data need used provide insight seems obvious think anybody make database decision industry necessarily used kind approach lot apps see look hood really necessarily using data meaningful way help provide insight better better messaging many still single single message across multiple segment another important part think consumer data need owned portable building program important question ask solution give expensive say loyalty program try get contract going lose information customer really important part understanding program lot solution think back migration evolution say really internet online retail forth player solution exist right necessarily going one five year order make dynamic evolving program really important restaurant restaurant company able data beacon wifi integration really important little bit little bit beacon technology really taken hold yet meaningful way going become important part surrounding store experience restaurant solution able integrate beacon wifi set future going going bring time proximity trigger beyond important think really biggest predictor term able catalyze purchase customer making sure getting right time right place restaurant customer proximity actually get restaurant viable viable target time also extremely important right need understand concept target making planned decision couple day ahead date night spontaneous purchase going purchase lunch available purchase history tracking customer also extremely important lot chain restaurant still uniform system uniform plus order able really track people purchased still long way able harness data extremely important part making sure part part plan behavioral segmenting lot different say psychographic segmenting industry talk segmenting talk use different psychographic bucket forth really mass medium tool behavioral segmenting much specific understanding people purchased making decision like actually actually use use brand similar term collected used important distinction context relevance hugely important talking amazon example sending people message relevant time place going shutdown going another opportunity interact people message automation also really important part message necessarily need automated able set message launching right group customer right time going edge think program also ready seen little far technology deployed inside restaurant going become important part think go forward term making experience meaningful tailored customer program launched need make sure part vision part capability able plug solution think simple app really simpler better know crucial component right little bit need go company able deliver order payment reward multiple channel communication fee behavioral analytics important part context marketing component need able feed data deploy context relevant marketing think couple example industry really ca talk technology particularly loyalty apps without talking without talking starbucks really know first successful restaurant loyalty app includes really payment structured reward surprise delight sort component well well stored value important know starbucks also concept really use gold standard sort follow need extremely cautious starbucks little bit different extremely high frequency business loyalty loyalty component make lot lot sense also think misconception people signing loyalty program structured reward think starbucks app actually played making experience palatable customer really big advantage see starbucks think think also know past month starbucks said okay well sort walk back structured reward component right speaks volume know originally started say loyalty program put structured reward think future adopter really really tell u future take another another look whether structured reward loyalty type program first necessary also potential economic consequence say making reward rich may giving stuff away free people going come anyway along line know chili know say know app guess loyalty program actually got lot happy progress recall back august 15 attributed almost point sale drop loyalty rollout gave number different reason took attention away upselling inside restaurant roll pulling back type reward discounting simultaneously speaks making sure company announcing going new app rolling new technology done math understand potential consequence seen lot loyalty rollouts assumption loyalty loyalty mean stop channel truth certain fraction customer going opt loyalty program people want communicated text messaging would hate want contacted email really important understand start looking new paradigm new
