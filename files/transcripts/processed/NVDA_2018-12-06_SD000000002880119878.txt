billion run rate think last analyst day talked handling 50 billion 30 billion huge number look 3 billion obviously lot go put financial analyst hat see law large number growth whether 200 40 50 people trying figure curve maybe perspective mean 2 part people may familiar training learning inference side first wave kind learning figuring want nvidia second part deploying inference inaudible really interesting question think start right term data center business think actual performance seen last year even seen last couple year still term number server actually deployed world le maybe low single digit term overall installed base equally term look overall hyperscale overall csps term overall use capex still extremely small overall percentage reached run rate exceeds probably 3 billion year term work overall data center believe continued expand overall workload address expand type compute recently example introduced overall t4 heard right area overall machine learning overall use term overall inferencing continues overall expand workload traditionally looked 3 different type market focused term data center one focused term work term supercomputing computing work term wisp csps hyperscales 2 expanded addition q blayne peter curtis colette m. kress q blayne peter curtis colette m. kressof overall t4 address overall enterprise market enter expanding new market machine learning data analytics well ability outside supercomputing csps hit overall enterprise expand workload past deep learning machine learning supercomputing mostly term new workload t4 essential term bringing consider scale overall infrastructure second generation using overall tensor core ability overall mass volume hyperscales enterprise using overall t4 even t4 inference pas could plugged inaudible server date seen deployment inference done cpu going deficient still early day begged everybody waiting inﬂection point going happen inaudible make decision put extra processor server look next year something think start absolutely t4 important actually quite well already know google one first adopt put term google cloud platform overall csps working quite fast actually move also incorporate t4 establishing additional space within data center mass use overall t4 clearly term next direction go form factor absolutely solid overall software stack order deploy overall t4 throughout overall data center throughout overall workload believe hyperscales long term likely get almost every single one overall server data center accelerated even part inference data center edge application play leader auto always supportive auto bus tour thank tuesday saw head business felt like message little different everyone focused level 4 5 taking longer kind deploy wave whatever want call autopilot actually may coming quicker kind perspective shift mean nvidia yes think important understand whether looking robotaxi focused level 4 level 5 looking level 2 clear amount compute necessary complete either one size level term autonomous vehicle learned year supportive different oems tier 1 q blayne peter curtis colette m. kress q blayne peter curtis colette m. kresswhat important architecture delivery full solution autonomous platform use term testing development today referred xavier well term overall drive software incorporated essential term work need complete testing complete overall development work whether level 4 level 5 happens first whether level 2 2 stream absolutely happening level 4 level 5 much complex type problem need overall redundancy able function matter car would driver would overall steering wheel work term level 2 level 2 first bring level level 2 market platform first win volvo term mainstream passenger car also front u know competing term time frame testing actual silicon today actually work absolutely instrumental sure market next couple year maybe interesting see inaudible also full particularly auto entire full stack ﬂeet autonomous car team labeling give perspective exactly range offering versus maybe wanted oem working tier 1 wanted go alone bring table versus others yes correct full stack ability provide many different configuration even overall compute standpoint create compute platform soc gpu could 2 socs 2 gpus depends term want overall configure inside type car even additionally complete full stack take work holistically term overall software many case likely partnered working jointly term want define autonomous vehicle level 2 robotaxis working think interesting meeting rob saunders headed auto actually lot edge inference market spend lot time talking whether trucking actually delivery maybe give u think maybe 3 silo auto kind robotics even health care talk kind outline opportunity seeing new thing pop q blayne peter curtis colette m. kress q blayne peter curtisyes believe world autonomous machine move forward going material amount overall compute necessary essential term machine function term future developed 2 different platform address market talked xavier overall autonomous vehicle also jetson platform centering around robotics centered around drone centered term machine whether medical device scanned work need case look overall ai required autonomous part open source platform versus xavier platform still functioning term algorithm overall cuda market know tremendous amount device continue see broaden arena overall market yes addressing putting developer hat term may actually impact model use case whether within warehouse automated forklift get make sense use case mean saying like china could get thing last mile seems really futuristic inaudible another one make total sense better solution think opportunity layering next year story think little bit longer term think work happening realtime even though may sound futuristic think last mile think truck driving across u.s. middle night tremendous amount work happening many key overall trucking industry think delivery absence trucking actually employed deliver much good cyberspace large problem need address overall safety concern also front center term want going see lot work term development manage overall computing need happen mean need practice significant amount data mean addressing work data center term helping infrastructure able manage data able mine overall data come solution therefore road next couple year see today maybe end consumer see today development side busily working honestly competitive landscape may going back data center semi long time seen much investment one particular area best story last month think nearly 50 company seen significant funding attacking 50 billion opportunity think also interesting seen colette m. kress q blayne peter curtis colette m. kressvertical customer google first amazon last week announcement solution maybe think google great example also one largest customer worked maybe maybe multiple solution exist time yes ability underlying architecture get overall mass scale ability spread throughout overall data center consistency across ability overall data center product address almost every single type workload would available term data center consistent
