good well hello everyone welcome keynote session afternoon excited today joined thomas kurian ceo google cloud thomas took ceo google cloud almost exactly 2 year ago november 2018 going explore thomas strategy going explore transformation seeing world technology particularly around cloud certainly incredible track record success already 2 year really looking forward talking thomas described strategist technologist operator competitor peer market quite achievement three certainly sure one big driver successful many role oracle 22 year heading product development moved lead google cloud graduate princeton engineering science degree mba stanford certainly enormous credential take lead technology thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurianthat transforming business transforming world welcome excited today thank dave pleasure joining discussion lot ground cover going start maybe broad going explore different area cloud strategy maybe would help audience talked initially talked initially strategy came job 2 year ago vision perspective certainly cloud going taking google maybe start kind bigger description google cloud strategy yes started simple understanding driving shift cloud went back early 2000 looked lot software service value proposition really around convenience get something done much conveniently next phase really data center service put stuff data center lot around cost eﬃciency looked talk customer saw biggest shift driving adoption cloud around digitization use data serve customer new way digitally strategy simple wanted enable digitization business process using data different way different industry wanted offering high scale infrastructure platform data analytics solution specific industry industry different need wanted online small medium business reach use capability online well build sale customer service organization support large customer focused executing strategy seen kind disclosed investor revenue grow significantly 2019 impressive started dig strategy building capability customer use know partner big part strategy try bring value think read talked whoever creates value capability along value chain large enterprise small enterprise going win end day talk brought partner whole concept creating value bringing service cloud general view cloud provider going succeed end one differentiated based solution offer also david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckayecosystem partner solution top taken effort got identify specific place think partner complement u work closely partner enable give couple example every large company typically move partner help implement solution product solution company service company great relationship many largest service company world accenture deloitte tc wipro infosys others taken lot work train team enable deliver solution identified many industry best application provider industry example neck wood dave shopify retail felt retailer really going look center piece felt shopify great platform many retailer focused work provide capability underlying platform successful jointly thoughtful approach enable broad breadth solution went along partner think ip create together lot started partnership certain place know end different place year 2 year 3 year think ip look partner many thing many client solution three different model ip work place build solution partner early adopter solution retain ip customer get example partner get benefit part first experience solution work large telecommunication company modernize contact center example using voice technology artificial intelligence model done second way work partner retains ip exclusively meaning build platform learning learning industry solution domain particular customer owns ip third thing done case built joint platform take market together medical field example working mayo clinic bunch joint initiative take broader medical community together around digital health three model ﬂexible depending industry partner want working together make complete sense guess partner strategy would also maybe touch would change trying use partner attract enterprise client versus small business client thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurian yeah focused strategy geography industry size client example specific partner great experience public sector institution serving government set partner different one latin america versus north america versus europe instance partner example strong presence particular country definitely difference small medium enterprise versus large enterprise need quite different delivery model solution quite different focused approach something drive many core economy canadian economy u.s. economy small business drive economy one thing found pandemic pivot next question bring small business u resource access ai capability data set need service need tailored respond element market unmet need sure significant business small medium enterprise want make super easy small medium enterprise go website log username credential get access service done lot work continue optimize ease adopt example see lot people building online presence small retailer small restaurant chain small delivery company pandemic large one jostling presence online even small medium business need online focus quickly easily give get online communicate customer collaborate one another incredibly pleased result seeing adoption tool biggest barrier taking advantage tool certainly see movement scale movement brand scale yet much employment rest small business one thing together think helping small business along know part solution cloud allowing access data insight capability ca afford anything else stopping really competing successful digital world david i. mckay thomas kuriansome physical resource compete look small retailer example one big thing struggle supply chain delivery capability et cetera large company scale part trying side enabling digital business model cost scaling digital business model much lower cost scaling physical business model part effort help smaller medium enterprise giving access technology technology large enterprise get access made easier pick use also give ability scale digital business model big competitive advantage successfully right great point started touching obviously pandemic operating change challenge different segment economy different size organization first talk leader challenge operating world technology side lead google cloud different thing coming obviously increase demand service responding leader challenge seen broad brush think perfect response moving quickly would say learned thing observing understanding could better first one adaptive lot discussion leadership team alphabet manage global workforce employee reality pandemic hit different country different time delegated lot decision local country leader oﬃce leader situation new zealand example may look different united state even asia different part asia one second think keeping employee engaged throughout variety different thing done importantly think giving sense purpose purpose focused around customer keep people unified go forward customer side many new thing introduced focused evolving technology quickly web conferencing technology example huge huge growth user minute scale technology support people financial service retail gaming huge spike traﬃc big part work working enable able deal support proud employee done focused making sure understand committed success well lot different parameter generally adaptive looking ahead planning ahead recognizing purpose keep employee even david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurianduring diﬃcult time focused serving customer lesson taken away sure many thing need better think better leader human hybrid world purely physical purely digital world insight think today versus thought april different sure think differently year continue learn learned innovative work best human think combination thing seen listen team example engineer example one thing seen certain thing find actually much productive work home le disruption time lot people say design session sort idea wanted discus colleague used grab around water cooler talked example team notion call everybody oﬃce order brainstorm went people home done bring people together socially distanced oﬃce environment bit cohesive think everybody learn continues good thing working oﬃce setting really good thing working home environment blending two art future mind yes well said absolutely evolving listening employee going critical try build engaged productive workforce future brave new world sure maybe pivot certainly learning lot online business online commerce accelerated trend many area talk think cloud role future even bigger opportunity capability perspective changed coming past year know interesting look seeing different industry almost every place work digitized look way people went hospital meet doctor people used go bank branch certain thing want online people used go store buy thing buying thing online first phase change saw notion digital front door every industry way government distribute unemployment insurance small business loan benefit also gone online david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckayso first phase second phase help use data understand serve customer better product service put front manage inventory better retailer optimize supply chain third take lot physical process make eﬃcient manufacturing quality assurance better people stand next one another end manufacturing line inspect product service seen sort every phase accelerated significantly pandemic seeing shift use technology solve problem every time think potential technology moving using data knowledge value always stumble quality data first getting data place create knowledge value big barrier trying help largest enterprise firm improve quality data lead use tool built really harness far approach qualitative data right probably biggest impediment able use new technology focus make easier software understand data fundamental level thing done understanding instance looking document still lot people ﬂoating world really able understand text paper really fundamental level historically people used talk natural language processing really thought understanding sentence word reality human being expect understand conversation conversation leave lot thing assume implicitly remembered pushing boundary constantly able understand data fundamental level structured unstructured able describe provide tool able analyze process much easy way people could massive amount data organization manages capital market side consumer side truly differentiating capability large enterprise small enterprise seamlessly extract value data derive different data point apply tool built capability cloud huge differentiating capability play google cloud enterprise solution product capability different google advertising google mail type capability bring meet two world together leverage incredible horsepower original google capability thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurian lot trying apply technology solve fundamental problem give two example one retail problem retailer face lot today people went store buy thing demand easy forecast store store basis people buy online want pick store buy store want thing shipped home becomes extremely diﬃcult forecast manage inventory inventory big part capital tied retailer worked set tool help people really forecast inventory much accurately using expertise artificial intelligence allows retailer plan example inventory differentiated way similar example financial service everybody worried fraud thing like laundering one thing seen look laundering many different tool used today tenancy generate lot false positive look largely using older technology based rule rather newer tool technology applying expertise artificial intelligence data processing help solve business problem central retail financial service manufacturing thing assist people problem could solve elegantly maybe pivot taken route next key element think strategy remember certainly around industry vertical talked talked bit bit broadly mentioned retail financial service specifically like jump financial service relevant u certainly talk vertical strategy chose arrange building compete yeah technology applies industry see different industry focused different need trying deliver solution industry primary industry public sector financial service retail healthcare manufacturing communication medium look financial service break financial service consumer institutional banking wealth management capital market insurance different requirement give illustration goal use data processing streamline business process within organization transform customer interface allow people build new product source revenue david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurianso look example insurance working number leading insurance company around world around important process one example change underwriting streamline claim processed third put digital agent front consumer may feel comfortable going insurance agent oﬃce still example taking base technology applying different domain different industry seeing enterprise customer always want problem solved applied make easier adopt focused kind approach big challenge say working enterprise client say yes thanks helping process saved time money allowed sell next competitor something part agreement enterprise client inaudible premise cloud going available industry participant ip separated kind repackaged ... vast majority client recognize maintain ip able enhance move faster vast majority case people say long work give advantage starting part early adopter program thing recognize value come shared innovation people find benefit generally pleased able solve major customer problem well technical diﬃculty time maintaining overall curve innovation help player industry jump financial service obviously heavily regulated industry thinking dealing regulator move bank insurance company onto google cloud service regulator look operation technical diﬃculty system regulator convince one evolving platform address requirement regulator lot work done notion able use google technology cloud platform data center customer provided significant benefit financial service around notion concentration risk regulator concerned second put place operational practice policy example many european financial institution want data maintained europe many financial institution certain access requirement access david i. mckay thomas kuriandata put place lot operational practice govern use data particularly financial service data lastly go regular audit regulator financial regulator country case europe also european central bank people policy organization work super closely understand want regulation go evolving technology able support regulatory requirement general cloud becomes important part landscape industry different country expect get requirement kind committed meeting obviously thought really good see question coming regulator start move service started pivot another key component understand google strategy around kind anthos believe latin derivation ﬂower kind management capability talk little bit strategy differentiates maybe unicloud competitor would maybe self describe use example imagine back 1997 internet happening said certain web page available microsoft browser web page available netscape browser web page available firefox browser know internet would succeeded would fragmented approach want enable organization primary barrier adoption cloud organization big part think organization say want three different cloud team one google one amazon one microsoft one team learn give choice want deploy approach complexity providing customer ability use cloud provider choice without locked provider way build open programming model people build deploy manage secure workload lot work done went taking data analytics technology many many people find differentiated machine learning tool made available platform reason people said use chosen someone else put data bring data processing data opposed way around feel right customer give choice eventually get success regulatory landscape evolved notion sovereignty come know hey want regional presence even example government public sector depending change david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckayclassification certain kind information people use different cloud use give choice ﬂexibility seen really strong interest customer approach taken talk little bit partner chosen execute containerization partner kind tenderization strategy obviously think thing choose cloud partner broad set partner fall four bucket tool developer tool developer used deploy also package application second tool allow run workload third tool migrate data common requirement people want move data around lastly tool around security secure environment partner number example look security space common requirement lockdown container provide container security good partnership palo alto network area quite thing always clear want enable tool provide partner ecosystem want bring solve problem going beyond technical ability unicloud competitor kind block strategy ability run environment independently run environment independently abstract underlying cloud provider ability block right right sure thought great think talk regulatory corporate strategy small business strategy need manage short risk right risk porting beholden one development capability something certainly think managing operational risk time think fantastic strategy touched another theme wanted discus cybersecurity something certainly omnipresent heightened pandemic see movement towards public cloud service processing capability data residing see world endpoint world 5g touch talk security strategy protecting data protecting partner customer omnipresent cyber world thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurian philosophy around security boil basic tenet number one make sure security easy operationalize second provide tool detect threat risk third make easy automatically remediate problem historically also challenging lastly allow people choose configure system minimize way endpoint cloud give couple example one common thing felt people would really like encrypt data encrypted much diﬃcult malicious people get access historically two diﬃcult thing one making encryption possible hard manage key lot complexity second data encrypted rest transit process left wide open somebody could always open front door get access came solution encrypt data time rest motion processed also made people let complicate manage second example something felt strongly making easy detect compliance security practice taken security converted configuration operator look system say secure historically use lot tool super diﬃcult seesaw ph get sense secure made much simpler threat detection capability identify running secure environment inaudible healthcare system unloading healthcare data maintaining hipaa compliance today diﬃcult lastly working advanced solution around cyber protection even external attack imagine lot technology google applying domain think significant area work need done part industry yes really impressive built capability expect protect data rest say motion also processed within machine think really really important obviously thought talk kind 5g going change processing data making decision impact kind think security think capability world 5g know 5g given investment telecommunication company making 5g network 5g network provide lower latency also bandwidth given lower latency integrating call mobile edge computing solution many different carrier david i. mckay thomas kurianaround world network carrier network actually computation run network allows application new kind application low latency available right network see lot different solution providing technology platform mobile edge also providing catalog solution specific industry partner ecosystem make easy customer adopt give practical example working large manufacturing company run manufacturing shop ﬂoor robot run shop ﬂoor clean room environment control system computer talk robot therefore need close robot factory ﬂoor lot time technician go repair disk replace disk thing wanted u put network working telecommunication partner built network close factory get low latency disruption people walking repairing thing factory ﬂoor allows get combination better value carrier carrier becoming network becoming locus application delivery better solution customer right great example exciting usage model talk little bit artificial intelligence know running time got couple topic may sort squeeze last minute ai much promise much capability talk exciting application seen ai google invested heavily outside cloud ai capability reinforcement learning obviously think capability going brought cloud barrier see really leveraging incredible technology talked data earlier third question probably remind third question little bit ethical ai think society using tool inaudible step see ai applied support augment human variety different industry field example done work using image recognition let radiologist better tool diagnose tumor image processing accurate identify tumor cell helped many manufacturing company image processing top shop ﬂoor quality inspection without human standing next one another reduces risk human shop ﬂoor also speed manufacturing line many many example place artificial intelligence whether image processing understanding data helping people understand conversation going change way organization function use value data different way david i. mckay thomas kuriannow time also careful technology powerful one context also potentially negative consequence example work object detection object detection instance got human distress water example detect help coastguard rescue easily example project one part world time technology used identify whether person specific individual technology human identification number potentially negative consequence instance would lead diversity inclusion bias careful putting forward ethical ai framework feel powerful technology principle govern use technology google adopted something called ethical ai put forward set principle meant govern use ai product expect people using ai use also meant foundation discussion technology company policy maker right way ai used world also great example fascinating double side equation trying help also trying protect confidentiality ethical side amazing like ask one question know couple minute left one important issue dealt within society leader building fairer inclusive society going forward touched talk little bit mean thought building fair inclusive society leading within google general view technology still something distinguish person race nationality unique advantage create next technology view need representative provide opportunity people background able create new technology innovative google u boil four thing recruiting diverse inclusive population helping develop people diverse background promoting rewarding retaining specific work going every one area working people operation team employee matter great importance u want place represent build representative technology well representative organization thing change example people often think educate manager hire cultural fit hire evolve culture organization hire people make feel comfortable hire something make organization stronger representative broader community live work lot work constantly paying attention see way improve organization david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurianlearning also discussing many university different organization matter great importance u well said think definition diversity right different perspective hiring likeness challenging think differently important point thomas go another hour right know taken lot time appreciate time spent u today think covered lot topic hope everyone feel power technology building going different vertical partner built differentiate capability future going transform small large enterprise bringing power ai bringing power processing data process within vertical put capability transformational technology excited able talk conference today thing building feel future fingertip building behalf everyone sincere thank great conversation today thank much dave pleasure joining well sure see soon behalf entire audience sincere thank thank much
