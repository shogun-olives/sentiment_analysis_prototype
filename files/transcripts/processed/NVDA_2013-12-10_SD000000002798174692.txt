right thank welcome everybody next session nvidia welcome chris evenden part ir team nvidia format little bit different fireside chat going start chris giving u quick overview nice slide deck move slide start cozy fireside chat open q cozy cozy thanks ambrish want spend like maybe five minute framing nvidia company see mission become world leader believe world leader visual computing sell technology market matter gaming one second one workstation actually rendering car another photograph car hard form computing cloud data center smart device well technology use technology differentiates u market gpu sell number way sell either pure ip chip gpu soc system chip actually primarily gpu differentiation graphic card actually whole system another business moving way think business today gaming pc workstation business stable solid strong generator cash cloud data center business got two business got business call grid cloud application tesla high performance computing tesla business proven growth business profitable growing strongly cloud early day lot trial lot interest business revenue probably next year sometime smart device slower start good year last year slow start year product delay growing strongly back half year finally ip ip really business started majorized actually verb gpu actually package technology company building device let take closer look obviously new business growing strongly smaller base think surprise people core pc business well really result chart say first nine month year compared first nine month last year see business gpu business people think pc business therefore must affected malaise affected rest pc industry must poorly actually case see chart significantly outgrown market focused segment market whole pc market mainstream pc market without question slow slow last year slow year evidence perhaps bottoming coming taiwan reading certainly weak pc gaming market completely different story showing strong growth believe market whole growing 10 year similarly workstation market professional visualization professional graphic strong performer u particularly last 12 month actually period talking well tesla high performance computing application graphic us gpu gpu actually powerful parallel processor using processing path task might weather modeling might derivative pricing example choosing example closer home relatively small base run rate 200 million showing strong growth reached critical point business actually business one personally get excited stable 100 million year sort level couple year recently broken think reason support enough application big enough channel term obvious computer vendor sell service based technology year ago group would sold directly customer getting business generating like sense might guy research johnson johnson looking drug interaction know accelerate protein modeling inaudible delivered tuesday happening way business really beginning scale half world supercomputing installation testing software obviously making big business one implemented expect continue grow strong market share grid brand new business revenue number sort report today report customer trial basic take step back basic philosophy make virtual desktop infrastructure vmware citrix work better particularly improve specifically improve user experience implementation citrix industry show user show conference july year inaudible said user experience biggest obstacle implementation department wholly convinced nature virtualization love security love manageability love total cost ownership start pilot project user look think well 1995 would want reject remove obstacle improve user experience support video support new user interface mean basic implementation even support transition within powerpoint right support limited customer uptake 150 customer trial last quarter 212 clear growth clear excitement enterprise 18 24 month purchase process would expect see material revenue back half next year probably tegra mobile device system chip whole multimedia computer single chip good year last year slower start year starting motor xiaomi phone shipping china great review automotive business particularly strong see doubling year next year year actually 1 billion 2 billion worth business already booked automotive see 23 brand 116 model could many 30 million car ship tegra inside next year still huge market opportunity u phone phone certainly large opportunity u broader see opportunity tegra anywhere visual computing intersects android android ubiquitous wherever android wherever visual computing matter android think make curve tegra phone one market tablet set top box gaming device automotive well probably others named suppose putting ahead recently lte modem certified vodafone well final route market like ip spent 20 year core key want avoid use word fundamental fundamental specific meaning context patent fundamental patent graphic hear analyst see 500 key graphic patent one even come close 6,400 patent asset patent patent filed yet granted 6,500 engineer working patent q ambrish srivastava chris evenden q ambrish srivastava chris evendenand filing actually accelerated filing rate filing around 500 1,000 year generating quite lot ip would like monetize value primary path monetizing actually license graphic core another technology also parallel looking company might infringing ip conversation well think appropriate finally cash return mentioned strong cash generation business fundamental philosophy return cash shareholder dividend obviously free cash ﬂow actually actually lot cash passed discontinuity crash 2008 feel confident continued cash generation ability started dividend large cash reserve returning share repurchase started end fy13 almost year almost exactly year think calendar think calendar 2012 calendar 2013 calendar 2014 recently announced intention return 1 billion next year one challenge cash generated abroad recently announced convertible offering essentially way borrowing cash offshore enabling u return shareholder think summary way think company strong cash generation core business proven growth opportunity tesla growth option grid finally good prospect ip licensing business well okay time looking clock question answer chris end come bmo conference want next ti want next ti want next ti going ask easiest question first hard get traction mobile side commitment company mobile handset also extending tablet intel committing guiding greater 2.5 billion operating loss next year mobile effort kind pale loss far term multiple speaker q ambrish srivastava chris evendenit competitive market think one key factor going lead success market product actually differentiates user experience right able show device manufacturer improve experience user go saying got greater level integration got better chip one thing differentiate user experience necessary degree price entry think visual computing angle come believe really enable u differentiate user experience gaming obvious application gaming significantly better device got nvidia gpu silicon driver software ecosystem build around well put lot investment whole product like rather chip gaming also web browsing experience zooming pdf right render much faster otherwise would mean visual experience putting advanced new soc includes kepler pc level gpu programmable use general purpose computing task well gpu good taking data turning image good taking image turning data well process data world around u brings reality car example tell thanks backup camera easy u use gpu tell moving white line highway allow driver collision avoidance autonomous parking thing tesla similar sort technology applied tesla yes built technology built development infrastructure platform cuda platform aware bringing mobile gesture recognition another example application mobile device might want think differentiate consumer experience think give u strong competitive position respect amount money intel undertaking invest market think illustrate hard x86 vendor move arm ecosystem right much arm ecosystem intel know intel ever found interloper somebody else ecosystem new game clearly serious would never got lot clever engineer well managed company got try extra hard moving somebody else ecosystem q ambrish srivastava chris evenden q ambrish srivastava chris evenden q ambrish srivastava chris evenden okay turn easier question something guy good job taking away anything tegra shareholder return guy turned around committed recent offering illustrates right way think capital allocation tied capital structure commitment going making beyond done x free cash ﬂow evaluating metric evaluating metric undertaken actually commit one right think inaudible think currently paying something like 25 free cash ﬂow dividend obviously got plenty room increase future expected dividend payout obviously also expect free cash ﬂow increase well still 3 billion bank plenty return far got public commitment disclosed 1 billion next year probably 160 million 170 million dividend carry rate lead another 840 million 830 million share repurchase commitment made far model say much cash actually need operate obviously significantly le 3 billion yes okay let switch business pretty unique ip taken newer area gone opened new front speak heterogeneous computing tesla saying think used le 100 million broken close 170 million 200 million kind run rate time slide intel put know sliced diced market share measured understood sure sliced way give biggest market share like would 95 market share number jump intersect360 data research organization said 85 share back july supposed technically date intel 4 11 fpgas amd thing intel obviously pretty active market actually mean remember back launched larrabee launched graphic card said time way graphic card one day tesla competitor clear beginning exactly ended right admitted going graphic card although pat gelsinger went public stage said thing said never graphic card certainly active space actually good u sense biggest obstacle tesla adoption persuading people needed move away ordinary cpu obstacle requires software development part lot make easy possible effort required go say look going run power war going run performance war need performance per watt need use technology work obstacle thinking well wait faster xeon come everything fine want continue work get automatically faster fine intel going xeon phi essentially old larrabee like graphic card like architecture saying thing u saying yes intel saying well ca rely new xeon going intel tell ca rely new xeon quite convincing nvidia self serving tell ca rely new xeon faced choice u intel intel throw money problem get good marquee win ultimately come application support developer support far incumbent regard support many code intel try make case port run x86 code natively true statement narrow specific sense true statement sense yes run code natively xeon phi actually run slower regular xeon measured running 0.6 0.7 time soft actually meaningless statement actually want get benefit parallel get inaudible xeon phi essentially exactly work u analogist except done lot work already lot main mass library like vmd namd amber thing already ported matlab thing already ported hardware done lot work quite way ahead regard announced new chinese super computer certainly take rating regard think made much money purchase mean certainly ask intel much made mean think 32,000 ivy bridge cpu 48,000 xeon phi public information charge 1,000 one 1,500 get 104 q ambrish srivastava chris evenden q ambrish srivastava chris evenden q ambrish srivastava chris evendenmillion piece business charging standard price would ask intel much made deal put slide tam big application driving adoption able break 100 million barrier well obvious broad supercomputing category broad supercomputer like titan oak ridge national lab used number thing ca talk specific maybe one example give extra dynamic talked stage two protein literally model attraction electrostatic attraction individual atom two protein molecule protein molecule kind thousand atom actual shape molecule really affect effectiveness drug whatever complex intense mathematical problem run extremely well gpus promising area u broken think come back software support guy work think mentioned earlier inaudible know tesla help know ibm stock tesla phone regular ibm salesman get server delivered whereas year ago evangelize 25 million quarter level retrospect believe level support directly team bandwidth support directly reason break support sale directly happening broader sale channel actually finally start scale business staying newer business grid seems customer trial traction really building awsa adopted yes become please define u meaningful percentage revenue say know guy beginning set needle interesting question best guess second half next year started trial earlier year 18 24 month software maturing time supported natively xendesktop 7 large degree q ambrish srivastava chris evenden q ambrish srivastava chris evenden q ambrish srivastava chris evenden q unidentified participant chris evendensupport quite yet complete support vmware looking extend support yes second half next year inaudible define meaningful know would hate drawn stage give number would think material point second half next year okay mean put multiple speaker wanted get sense one question going open audience see question long list ca keep going aws inaudible publicly announced event application kind us deployed towards completely general purpose right depends amazon client actually want use graphic cloud hpc actually accelerating graphic also agreement amazon hpc side well ac2 data processing cloud well done analytics see okay kind announced begun early talk okay great okay well let see question audience end day one got anything left inaudible nvidia heard investor basically little bit question asked earlier guy going shut tegra return even cash investor sort give mobile effort think spoken little bit sort react situation yes pretty proud spend tegra also think mobile computing strategically hugely important great device certainly diﬃcult first half year characterize six month mean think issue pretty clearly pretty q unidentified participant chris evendenwell known tegra 4 later liked result position compete major tablet win probably really position compete much would actually ship first half year gave u slow start year made choice realized tegra 4 going late could accelerated would likely delayed tegra 5 need effect never time anything ever decided let tegra 4 stand fall make sure got tegra 4i time get tegra 5 ready time thing aggressive schedule aggressive sense time mean expecting everything go perfectly time tegra 4i would start sampling february said would sample first half year following semiconductor know first half year generally mean like early july right start sampling february four month ahead three four month ahead schedule tegra logan project logan codename actually started something july along pc level pc class graphic mobile tablet real discontinuity term visual experience consumer importantly time frame win design first half next year unlike taking another illustration tegra 3 tegra 4 24 month tegra 4 logan nine month completely different scenario also answer half question cost aspect law synergy business like tesla example gpu logan gpu develop geforce quadro tesla anyway already extra tweak done actually allocated formal cost tegra cost allocation fairly simplistic guess shutdown tegra save much money would think right effective way allocate cost perhaps retrospect hearing question first person asked perhaps something thought thought allocated cost nvidia plan shield game device intention q unidentified participant chris evenden q ambrish srivastava q unidentified participant chris evenden q ambrish srivastavayes seem though promoted heavily christmas season yes two intention two way shield succeed u one sell whole bunch two help build gaming android ecosystem right gaming obviously particular strength u impact visual computing 20 year experience gaming want android target platform developer hardcore game move way play strength shield part effort sense target say gaming android device look like play like give console quality game shield also link wider gaming ecosystem powered nvidia something game pc home play game couch shield using little book screen fact announced trial california online gaming streaming gaming game actually exists server somewhere subscribe game monthly fee model play shield quietly started debate several thousand people playing today part integral part broader gaming strategy term nvidia general android particular really want build could see pc side business profitable defensible niche kind overheard profitable defensible niche gaming pc market tell today pc market attractive market yes growing high profitable business inside pc market people tell thought one told mobile computing market attractive market either make gaming matter sense well got profitable defensible growing segment well right shield integral effort one last one inaudible microphone inaccessible yes posted available website chris evenden q ambrish srivastava chris evendenchris last question core gpu business right u believe saying better dynamic pc market everything hear supply chain sale low end volume appear right way think core gpu business discrete gpu volume going stay certain level think overall revenue perspective going fairly stable think unit level probably going go low end think continue decline high end continue grow revenue perspective offset profit perspective offset high end profitable unit perspective wo look attractive low end got large number moderately profitable business think continue go away think lot pressure mainstream notebook lot price pressure gpu one expensive element bond get little pressure got new technology like sfps touch competing part bond well diﬃcult place overall gpu business fine look particular mainstream business mainstream pc business think continue suffer think tough place okay thank much thank thanks everyone
