senior director automotive nvidia danny shapiro u think going first going go slide quick overview auto business go question open q take away sound great well good morning everyone thanks joining u clicker somewhere yes yes mitch probably got got everything guy got study read quick fine move want spend couple minute kind setting stage respect focused automotive artificial intelligence think lot know seen growth company moving graphic expanding artificial intelligence really 2 aspect ai lead directly auto industry kind first phase based data center need able ingest lot data able train iterate build deep neural network acquired autonomous driving well basically everything else going term revolution health care energy exploration finance industry ai transforming basically every type industry trained model sort take model put vehicle sensor data come analyzed use camera radar lidar perceive going running deep neural network make decision actually control vehicle model apply across industry term go vehicle specific solution address problem end end data center dgx product training also used inferencing web application type configuration vehicle run ai drive platform hardware software single architecture extends data center edge vehicle case focused hardware software ai engaged basically everybody hundred developer building nvidia drive working car truck shuttle bus construction equipment mining equipment agricultural lot market different company unique solution working different kind sensor underlying problem need solve foundational hardware software many many layer huge software team building platform open others develop seen great adoption fixed solution black box totally customizable everyone moving kind different way address problem different type vehicle different type use case want ip able create custom application based nvidia drive platform example stuff developing core ai system see drive right sensor eye image data go brain recognize sign lane car truck replace human eye brain system sensor data come actually bunch pixel frame video pixel number let say red green blue value inherent information ai able trained identify different type object scene understand sign lane marking another car truck pedestrian requires massive amount computing take place running code written software written data trained recognize pattern much better u room actually lot deep neural network running simultaneously car detecting object detecting lane detecting free space absence object processing lidar data point cloud processing radar information calculating distance detecting pedestrian right different neural net reason want redundancy diversity required ensure safety road want single app running everything reliant fact detecting object using one set data algorithm detecting lack object call openroadnet free space together provide sort double check safe drive want drive going hit something computing path 3 different algorithm come together used decide going steer vehicle mean though mass amount computing happen car ca take traditional automotive component piece together smart camera controller deliver kind robust solution safe put road saw zoox example right complexity going number thing tracking simultaneously one partner need ai supercomputing vehicle able deliver kind solution thing see obviously big part safety ensure safe early year announced availability call drive constellation system data center solution see going skin torn away 2 server one simulator using gpus generate sensor data basically emulating camera car would see radar lidar would see virtual environment sensing everything going simulation output top server pool gpus fed bottom server nvidia drive platform inside running full software stack essentially taking simulated input trying process real time make driving decision accelerate brake turn left turn right feed back simulator called testing basically rack one server represents virtual test vehicle test kind condition different type scenario different weather different time day control way really accelerate testing validation thing normally would want real world dangerous test give u ability rapidly advance testing development course validation autonomous vehicle shot u running simulator 10 basically replacing 10 virtual car people often ask u `` well many mile driven first important know mile driven rather scenario right use case specific corner case rare dangerous event happen driving test car usually nothing happens want pretty boring driving along stay lane stop car come stop front need ensure autonomous system able handle child running parked car somebody running red light driving wrong way whatever may create exhaustive list scenario want test also bad weather bad lighting sun setting right constellation let u virtual reality announced toyota gpu conference couple month ago toyota using u vehicle training system data center using constellation test validate exact hardware tested validated go car thing unique u open platform full solution dgx based software cuda apps constellation running drive sim software drive agx go vehicle running full software stack others build application give u really unique position marketplace approaching ai supercomputing bringing car complete software stack extends cloud car result virtually everybody industry building autonomous vehicle car truck shuttle well mapping company sensor company ecosystem building nvidia drive think point want get number know much want talk see growth potential really large right investor day talked tam market s30 billion little five year u bulk go inside vehicle volume ramp different level autonomy level 2+ advanced system basically taking technology putting fully autonomous vehicle bringing market sooner right necessarily waiting regulation place yet fully autonomous taking surround sensor taking ai supercomputing full software stack putting consumer vehicle today make safer driver still loop full level autonomous capability ensure car passenger inside stay safe also huge opportunity u datacenter automotive customer specifically adopting gpus train neural network running constellation drive sim software well great growth q mitchell toshiro steves danny shapiro q mitchell toshiro stevesopportunities early stage know talking car long time industry making lot promise projection time line keep slipping think industry recognized complex problem originally believed key safety right focused delivering safest possible solution want bring something prematurely result need compute right need layer software redundant algorithm requires compute standing still continuing innovate bring technology market different type vehicle different type use case think jump question okay question answer yes guess maybe start slide right since guy 30 billion tam kind 2025 think guess ramp term see revenue uptick driving versus training versus validation mean based kind look like training probably first part see kind think exactly auto business growing last decade predominantly driven infotainment first foray bringing graphic technology car five year ago saw transition first led mature company became ai company started bring ai vehicle well revenue vehicle still dominated infotainment seeing kind new wave infotainment term ai cockpit think going see growth mercedes mbux talk car say `` hi mercedes voice processing car type sensor processing car part ui point yes data center seeing autonomous vehicle customer make investment train neural network development side ongoing think always working make car safer better add new feature constellation available seeing huge demand great way testing validation think going play big role working regulator government agency need prove technology work simulation result test thing show public regulator danny shapiro q mitchell toshiro stevesyes interestingly something said earlier discussion said important look number mile driven look type environment case would able compare guy let say somebody else creating chip like tesla something like would able prove guy tested environment something like yes think california dmv engagement disengagement report published different company end year basically say number mile driven many disengagement per mile right driver intervene hard compare number apple orange kind thing company developing vehicle developing robotaxi service limited number test vehicle drive around bay area east coast europe asia really test validate algorithm work company whether volvo toyota mercedes one deploying scale validation think mentioned mile le critical opposed happens mile simulation part come make every second simulator count whereas driving along 101 diminishing return kind mile nothing happening u want test well algorithm work fog put couple engineer car drive way golden gate bridge spending many hour getting get maybe fog lifted instead simulator actually recreate condition test kind crazy stuff happening plus fog different time day blinding sun benefit simulation enormous course going replace real testing going use dramatically augment improve iterate quickly update software simulator key thing though like one test cloud something totally different real road though exact hardware software server tested put vehicle true digital twin okay think different type car guy involved see everything robotaxi delivery van et cetera right first mean asp differ trying put nvidia box car vehicle secondly one actually come first robotaxi side expect guess delivery van mean think term actual use case going forward danny shapiro q mitchell toshiro steves well think way characterize capability system difference opposed whether car whether truck problem essentially saw heard morning zoox right sensor configuration believe optimal sensor configuration regardless going put going need sensor going put different place truck versus car versus robotaxi shuttle essentially fundamental technology identical right surround sensor feeding massive amount data need processed different asp come play really much sensor processing need go level autonomy level 2+ base system kind entry level going way level 4 level 5 system hundred dollar entry system thousand dollar fully autonomous interim couple year seeing level 2+ system coming market announced tier 1 supplier still take technology build integrate work u deliver oems continental zf veoneer building level 2 u toyota already announced production plan volvo already announced production plan next several year number trucking initiative level 2+ driver assistance much higher level driver assistance road today often includes driver monitoring ai play big part ensuring driver still alert falling asleep distracted also robotaxi deployment working number robotaxi company presenting others whether bay area elsewhere world realizing problem solved supercomputing ca put bunch smart camera need ai computing platform nvidia leading technology front couple year early later year right mercedes daimler bosch nvidia going deploying robotaxis san jose pilot program last week 2 simple one partner trucking side completed trial u.s postal service figure autonomous run mail dallas phoenix trucking think one category though come much sooner others got since financial event mean one question sure wo like gross margin trajectory right go let say level 2 car let say level 5 realize asp may 10x right sort gross margin structure also occur ... danny shapiro q mitchell toshiro steves danny shapiro think different maybe old nvidia software hardware right great gross margin software enormous software stack saw different neural network part software drive o software neural net bunch library tool customer buying nvidia buying whole bunch different thing u could hardware software data center drive sim software software car think going see lot additional growth u one turn audience think another one topical tesla comment created chip essentially going able ride maybe talk u guess threat guy secondly guy going differentiated versus tesla able tesla long customer partner still right data center full nvidia think strategy belief much aligned think 2 company u one framing solution term hundred trillion operation per second inside car topped hundred top required ecus dozen vehicle centralized computing architecture really way forward tesla decided vertically integrate developing chip elon made lot claim exactly accurate little misleading term performance level sort quoting old number multiple chip reality think 144 top computer 320 topped energy eﬃciency similar kind mixed matched number make seem like big advantage adhere law physic chip design way come blue create something dramatically energy eﬃciency volume relatively small mean growing make great product drive one every day drive every day continue get better think strategy really aligned market 2 option tesla supercomputer nvidia one know anyone industry actually buy tesla one q mitchell toshiro steves q unidentified participant danny shapiro q mitchell toshiro steves right question audience inaudible know everyone heard question assumes liability seeing really carmaker right selling car autonomous mode like volvo said volvo autonomous mode volvo assumes liability way certainly pas occupant vehicle like get taxi right control liable course nvidia would responsible defect something nvidia end day automaker sort contract customer kind follow see car company least wave foreseeable future people leading industry want control user experience building application necessarily coming u saying give give car make want able control whole user interface experience deciding drive autonomously kind mode somebody engage app experience might tied together basically provided hardware software customize build application like whole perception stack may say well bunch engineer work benefit combine perception ai going maybe algorithm also running hardware whole system get better multiple algorithm working together create application right top ultimately decide car brake harsher turn sharper going oem going ultimately make driving decision experience autonomous mercedes may different autonomous honda right even though could using lot core technology application final decision making would sort automaker think key thing though car going much safer going taking risk u usually take behind wheel let go next question colette stated time favorite game monopoly aside look auto business mean company guy feel like compete mean intel got danny shapiro q mitchell toshiro steves danny shapiromobileye well right profitable okay point need talk guy see kind value proposition difference guy mobileye well definitely think approaching challenge differently mentioned see problem complicated everyone thought initially requires compute mean already tesla announced developing chip regardless built feel need compute already made announcement technology continues raise bar deliver computational horsepower lower energy consumption road map clear think hard one competitor many different architecture smart camera architecture cpu developing gpu supposedly neural net processor fpga totally disparate component trying cobble together develop solution different u single architecture cloud vehicle make development much streamlined open mean biggest thing others developing look ecosystem enormous made easy develop sort learned gaming segment right created tool library game developer deliver unique solution nvidia kind fueled original growth strategy really taking auto industry open end end really unique u second one little bit interesting side guy bought mellanox obviously bolstered data center side mean see saw presentation talking sensor lot guess anything guy think would interested term bolstering automotive capability yes mean think right obviously focused still closing mellanox deal end year made different investment automotive side usually could simple one usually lot number different software company sensor side pretty essentially want work different sensor company realize diversity redundancy sensor key make sure support optimize stack different sensor company make easy automaker q mitchell toshiro steves danny shapiro q mitchell toshiro steves danny shapirotruckmaker customer integrate sensor feel want use really focused trying feel need acquire specific sensor technology think make better u obviously sensor lidar company part nvidia going potentially hurt ability work easily lot lidar company perfect inaudible one technical diﬃculty service could something host datacenters use mean kind usual product path nvidia creating thing never market start developing using first get released world fact constellation announced gtc year ago spent year using fixing improving optimizing release customer could host many case wanting deploy developing datacenters full designed able test vehicle configuration specific putting vehicle whole goal exact hardware software go vehicle data center make easy iterate also know pass test good put road think pretty unique benefit enormous really accelerate development much way mean toyota going see announcement along front soon term others really adopting whole pipeline okay perfect thank coming okay thanks lot everyone see guy
