okay think ready get started pleasure mike schutz microsoft today going talk cloud azure also zack moxcey ir u today asked mention begin microsoft may make looking statement presentation refer sec filing risk factor related business true whether person listening web mike hoping could get 101 tutorial azure know lot azure think around 900 million run rate business service course cloud business broadly counted oﬃce 365 think little 5 billion run rate business would put world largest cloud vendor oﬃce 365 saas business amazon much bigger much competition lot value add think get microsoft incumbency advantage got million people write .net got infrastructure fact hybrid cloud strategy user say well maybe put cloud cloud work together could maybe get talk little bit azure microsoft cloud give u bit competitive assessment differentiation would good place start absolutely first want thank u exciting first event want really thank letting u participate lot detail built said think would good u parse go conversation way introduction run product marketing call cloud platform solution microsoft includes private cloud solution around window server system center virtualization management public cloud platform microsoft azure enterprise mobility solution love touch base interrelated eye customer talk thing answer question term rough 101 respect azure azure public cloud platform provides well number service around customer look u run application workload also connect existing infrastructure premise cloud able talk little bit high level focusing helping customer embrace public cloud integrating existing investment premise asked differentiation perspective look really zoom back little bit focus provide complete cloud platform mean want broadest set solution customer use premise providing consistent set technology customer build run application cloud premise combination whether service try connect cloud provide set service provides connective tissue data center public cloud data center within lie fundamental differentiation three dimension first around refer hyperscale broadest set region worldwide public cloud provider 19 region way comparison twice many aws google cloud platform 3 time google put azure close customer customer care want cloud provider geography region multiple reason data sovereignty standpoint geopolitical reason also practicality experience standpoint ca really change speed light want proximity cloud service close customer ultimately customer rick sherlund mike schutzin order invested significantly building global infrastructure power cloud service seen u last several year increasing footprint region like australia china announced going india year continuing grow global footprint customer provide global reach local touch one element think hyperscale couple vendor could invest scale global reach really shrink consideration set customer lot traditional vendor wo invested public cloud scale hyperscale lens couple vendor differentiation relates public cloud vendor like aws really around focus around enterprise grade hybrid root deep selling working enterprise global sale support organization partner ecosystem hundred thousand partner sell support deploy solution customer particularly commercial space want local touch local reach enterprise grade key differentiator u selling commercial segment enterprise segment nothing new u excited help transformation hybrid standpoint consistent solution across premise integrates really well help customer think data center one extension microsoft azure vice versa think asset inclusive run running microsoft azure technology help extend right mike got three hour worth question probably exciting opportunity chat compete aws example kind workload delivering perhaps distinct aws think market today large number customer start view destination believe great place start easy customer get started understand virtualization concept taking virtual machine putting cloud running way rick sherlund mike schutzone thing customer finding great certain workload still inherits complexity running virtualization premise still manage operating system inside virtual machine forth thinking service well moving hybrid cloud service example someone extend storage infrastructure premise cloud without necessarily move application hybrid cloud service well thinking area distinctly differentiate amazon going start disclosing margin aws quarter someone gartner said thought maybe much 60 gross margin stopped said excuse said 16 said 60 kind astounded keep seeing referred commodity business enormous scale guess possible scale could get kind margin longer term would seem least everybody else fatter margin going value add higher managing infrastructure platform aws go vendor like microsoft managing operating system database whole middleware stack right take lot complexity test dev use amazon want run application really need infrastructure aws enormous scale reach incumbency advantage everyone already run microsoft oracle infrastructure inherent advantage get incumbency advantage might azure know really started design point believed market would go long term subsequently built infrastructure service offering meet customer today certainly believe listening customer getting benefit moving mentioned moving complexity managing underlying part see tremendous benefit particularly agility get development organization able respond business rapidly microsoft taking managing underlying stack app instead operating system rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlundfrom offering standpoint believe mature offering addition mentioned term footprint developer today million .net developer building application premise cloud every day million developer using visual studio tool set able build application much working customer focused heavily devops developer productivity brings yes heard say initially offered market really wanted test dev kind work wanted service see evolving market might ready think using cloud handle lot workload kind outside test dev might better leverage strength definitely see organization think developing application cloud mind looking example accuweather accuweather know one heavily used weather application service given amount weather locally year sure get quite bit use thing interesting accuweather today azure looked alternative market including amazon opted azure today process roughly 6 billion request per month weather temperature forecasting originally started infrastructure found usage app course follows weather pattern got bad weather coming spike extremely high could trouble keeping scale building capacity able handle predict going happen also wanted able go globally provided global infrastructure scale demand let write le code manage le infrastructure scale demand customer extremely powerful used take month proof concept day agility respond need feedback getting customer tremendous largely powered eﬃciency get cloud mike schutz rick sherlundis market ready think build new thing azure going move existing thing going build new would pick .net platform would say well google got interesting stuff pivotal open source platform best opportunity guess would think term competing web native modern programming standard great think one thing way think azure finding incremental opportunity business opposed replacing application server premise 40 azure revenue talked past 40 azure revenue come startup isvs largely segment sold significantly past focusing segment well enabling existing customer sector enterprise able embrace cloud present tremendous opportunity u area organization .net shop use open source done strike number partnership market take open approach embracing open source linux azure one thing often surprise people 20 instance apps run azure running linux recently announced last year partnership docker container supporting corel linux distribution standpoint well number linux distribution azure organization preference java node.js want build linux docker container love time also helping .net million .net developer build modern application using latest technology mike one interesting thing new management brought microsoft ability acknowledge open standard need embrace feel necessarily good report earnings see well cannibalizing business sort market going hear really good thing silicon valley microsoft cloud seems like azure product people respect think ability support open standard take people surprise history microsoft mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlundbut guess degree supporting open standard appeal incumbency advantage .net developer ability know people going move workload cloud ability compatible stuff work together appeal scale advantage able appeal new developer platform open standard based would seem like building architecting address camp yes think building platform approach say want complete cloud platform run next generation application mobile first cloud first world core strategy shareholder standpoint able monetize expand addressable market bringing linux azure able think would monetize linux deployment past looking partnership oracle sap salesforce able run application integrate azure even run azure database running azure end day meeting customer right certainly believe first party application service quite competitive end day customer decides would like run another platform would love meet exactly interesting see press release conference call working oracle working salesforce cloud really necessary right got integrate got play well others platform trying push platform exclusion thing customer need run going suitable platform interesting environment data center asked oracle need data center argue use colocation lot saas industry us competitor infrastructure paas well mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlunddo need data center business really gotten meaningful scale yet okay using colocation ultimately important scale advantage derives data center indicated earlier important thing customer therefore taking global scale approach important ca colocation well look way get market different factor weigh may may example joint venture china able bring azure china main part make sure able bring technology customer huge economy scale think global scale need deploy work way think look see ultimate competitor business think microsoft azure early market paas feel like good spot definitely see google aws investing place vendor investing early day paas going interesting see play amazon invent conference vega november announced sql relational database typically think much platform give sql server oracle database run right see coming platform trying broader vendor mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz ca really speak obviously aws going invest believe investment term building layer inclusive data hybrid cloud approach continue differentiating market hybrid point really area different player market view customer existing investment want integrate look extend asset cloud rather model look scale advantage thought probably little 1 billion run rate business azure right oﬃce 365 run data center right infrastructure one thing talk term complete cloud oﬃce 365 microsoft azure offering customer really important area oﬃce 365 offered yet offer azure definitely focus complete solution customer multiple speaker trying think scale advantage also got xbox live got bing got actually pretty big scale business think data center cloud business look say well around 1 billion business probably underestimate scale opportunity leverage margin might infrastructure perspective property operate public cloud service consumer commercial global infrastructure operated team provide u learning build diverse platform run high transactional one side maybe high i/o provides u great diversity application able learn build best platform customer want put application cloud also provide u economy scale come deploying really broad global infrastructure rick sherlund mike schutz go market everyone already running technology business almost everybody degree give hybrid cloud capability choose want run thing anyone actually moving infrastructure look work leave would seem ability integrate new stuff cloud infrastructure already run would nice complement getting one vendor absolutely think whole approach offer hybrid cloud solution customer think maybe want run data center time vast majority customer azure incremental instead provision infrastructure max capacity black friday provision average tuesday use azure peak capacity need compatibility provide make really easy another really interesting area azure able increase addressable market monetizing selling solution workload like storage example hybrid cloud storage solution called storsimple called azure storsimple basically plug customer existing infrastructure could vmware infrastructure could infrastructure san tier data microsoft azure backup archival replication company example paul smith uk pretty retailer us storsimple bottomless storage repository storage need premise behind virtualized environment model almost like simplistically take picture phone automatically copy cloud model enterprise connect cloud customer seamlessly end user know worry itf inclusive operate running cloud storage one never really able monetize storage past yet area able think another example azure incremental existing window server system center business premise rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlund yes think business growing 100 year amazon obviously much bigger scale probably around 5 billion revenue right invent event said growing 40 year kind surprised last year think 70 expectation maybe could 100 year started really gain traction google came market little year ago year ago guess price cut pretty hard price cut 50 surprising amazon immediately matched pricing customer going let google set price market going pricing always going fixed percentage cost passing benefit consumer make really hard biggest scale really get margin business think couple different dimension think one core service like compute networking storage economy scale hyperscale cloud provider provide provide opportunity give back customer vendor scale think though seeing time price conversation customer changing looking value looking premium service deliver talked recently 60 customer using azure customer using higher value service key way drive premium premium value shareholder also offering value customer thing like paas enterprise mobility suite entitlement customer secure mobile infrastructure provide identity management ability u meet customer pricing perspective look market dynamic also continue upsell customer premium service key multiple speaker could customer care price everyone right market market pretty eﬃcient pricing storage compute mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz also realization typically customer may start build around really want look complete solution build around looking additional service left right helpful running vm cloud gigabyte storage cheap price value get much good business microsoft lead potentially much premium service like right okay going skip one topic open enterprise mobile management intune know get oﬃce 365 e3 version enterprise version think get version intune thrown managing desktop laptop particularly window 10 perhaps coming also get intune part console manage mobile device well historically really thought customer would trust microsoft manage android phone apple phone satya onboard seems making friend play well others sort wondering maybe microsoft big opportunity going forward play well others manage mobile platform think zoom bit two fundamental secular trend place one around mobility bring device u using device multiple form factor smartphones tablet may bought device addition enterprise buying type device mobility absolutely clearly secular trend one saas application addition needing work connect application provided organization inside company saas apps whether salesforce oﬃce 365 crm box concur workday user bringing cloud therefore intersection saas application mobility present real challenge security perspective helping end user productive anywhere rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutzthe enterprise mobility suite built combination mobile device management mobile application management powered intune name service data protection encrypting file microsoft rms last identity management user management providing single saas application providing control get able control access apps one run prem cloud multilayered approach taken enterprise mobility suite fantastic companion oﬃce 365 perspective oﬃce 365 enterprise mobility suite many way become way organization help user productive device want using best productivity apps help secure application data well making sure user access information single solution apple ship new version o available day zero supporting apple product got relationship trust conveying detail new o able support right away google android io set apis mobile app mobile device management vendor use absolutely able work provide right level capability release product relationship google good apple term support get work company equally well would say relative emm vendor see competitive disadvantage microsoft trying support platform great success intune matured year able expand offering android io rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz window 10 implication window 10 term managing mobile device think strength bring bear respect mobility trend enterprise mobility fact system center configuration manager pc management product highly deployed enterprise estimate two every three pc managed system center system center intune able provide single solution manage device whether pc tablet phone ﬂavor one console really resonates think silo device think manage extends window 10 continue manage window corporate network really well window 10 also managed mobile device using mbm able provide solution across pc well form factor great starting feel little guilty hogging open investor question investor little bit shy probably grab term breach seen breach thinking security cloud sure must one first question every saas company every cloud vendor address term security reason believe security worse better move company might scale advantage managing security think scale certainly provides u ability see malicious activity act one thing talk customer lot view lot trust term vendor believe customer look cloud security element privacy element compliance element security standpoint focused providing underlying security platform also tool organization encryption key example like access data offering service call key vault customer bring key rick sherlund mike schutzwe access key actually help ensure data encrypted manage key one example security capability providing another one user authentication layer got within azure active directory core part enterprise mobility suite technology provide anomalous user behavior detection think credit card company identifies fraudulent activity credit card identity theft different variety user name password theft got somebody might impersonating trying log enterprise use machine learning capability identify user trying authenticate two location delta would able get time would would physically impossible block access require authentication additional security security big element also focused privacy may seen recently received iso 27018 really high standard privacy well standard eu around eu model clause well privacy important focus lot compliance certification customer need depending industry geography three element really helping dialogue customer especially enterprise customer think moving cloud mike time zack thanks much microsoft u today thanks much
