good afternoon know mike mcconnell semiconductor analyst pacific crest pleased afternoon chris evenden director investor relation nvidia want keep open interactive possible going start question question obviously would encouraged maybe kicking think bright spot clearly company far year record high gross margin maybe talk reason margin expansion think importantly record high set last week conference call sustainable think level yes fair think worth taking step back noting recent run last couple year steadily increasing trend undeniably previous record high gross margin 46.3 came time amd hopelessly uncompetitive product market essentially worth reiterating far come couple year 56 point margin market strong amd got product okay reason answer question nature company changed based geforce anymore quadro tesla business 70 point plus business also pc market evolves seeing traditional business get weaker gaming business especially rtpc know concept talked better insightful way look pc market mike mcconnellis separate specialty pc pc mean specialty pc device someone buy specific reason reason might gaming might industrial design quadro might research simulation tesla specific reason go buy pc whereas broader part market like bit email bit web surfing check facebook page bit market really trouble bit market get cannibalized tablet people look whole market whole say well pc market well possibly well answer well gaming niche carved u extremely profitable well sort corporate average profitability niche niche grows 10 year apparently independently rest pc market travail main reason behind quadro significant business tesla marvelous quarter well think telling part tesla result quarter revenue came internal revenue shade short record course inaudible revenue came oem business oem setting cart someone else rather big wing like last record quarter record quarter tesla built world first powerful supercomputer necessarily favorable impact revenue time baseload run rate business really feel tesla reaching tipping point always hoped would reach enough application supported tesla scientist engineer forming weather simulation specifying new machine weather simulation say know want gpu acceleration already supported software great news u much lower touch business sense go oems opposed oak ridge national lab engagement course everyone company fire drill month great ten million dollar business ca scale business way whereas run rate business scale business steady dependable base keep growing main lever move margin second part question maintained hard see would drag margin like tegra tegra tegra chip business slightly corporate corporate gross margin far huge drag grow drag margin time desktop gpu growing tesla growing quadro growing sort balance basically look like margin fairly stable think know 56 point margin thing think cost side switched model source wafer tsmc basis opposed basis new product eat lot cost chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnellout gate early favorably getting higher margin towards end product lifecycle kepler kind second year shipment next year get multiple speaker ought profitable ever get saying saying anything next year think transition away kepler maxwell going something kind think model stuff like well think first thing bear mind tsmc know much money want get wafer regardless charge clearly changing risk assumption upfront used risk risk way whole industry operates wafer multiple speaker certainly outlier special case around 28 know transition 28 like 40 transition 40 changed aligned rest industry 40 nanometer transition put whole new team help u move new process node worked closely tsmc seeing huge cost risk moving maxwell definitely got die size performance per millimeter squared religion kepler lost focus bit product fixed maxwell mean better believe focused thing performance per millimeter squared performance per watt key metric evaluate product yes see multiple speaker danger understood question audience got several keep going one thing also look wanted stay graphic side first transitioning part model unit share high versus amd see opportunity take share traditional geforce business happen initiative feel like peripheral really move model probably fastest extent x maybe tegra kind obvious growth prospect tam chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden good question amd think aggressive know recently term trying win share back u tremendously expensive software bundling program think five six game offer free part three four midrange stuff like 100 200 300 worth software face value yet hardly begun move needle market share certainly pretty confident maintaining level term gaining share honestly year see share changing much one way major discontinuity would cause going forward continue try build strong gaming ecosystem around product working developer ensure best performance hardware reliable dependable performance hardware latest feature game stand visually competition feature like geforce experience help user software tool user download downloaded seven million time already automatically set gaining setting bunch thing well help user experience build tighter link customer quite lot customer loyalty space got group inaudible part yes part dependable best performance okay attach rate one thing think going changing intel obviously going adding new functionality performance characteristic atom core maybe held back past added challenge arm starting increase see situation bay trail start occupy skus overall mobile computing market risk believe graphic attach rate something participating anyhow going still occupying matter happens think scenario mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evendeni think latter true let expand go back pc versus specialty pc model people buy speciality pc buy discrete graphic integrated good enough gamer mean sure integrated graphic get good enough play last year game low resolution optional setting set zero never going good enough latest game let take table moment look remainder market pc sell market almost entirely notebook scenario notebook oems looking differentiate pc 400 notebook 500 notebook justify consumer spend extra 100 answer sometimes 3 5 7 climbing ladder answer sometimes graphic versus discrete graphic consumer tend focused graphic performance buying buying good discrete graphic better probably far thought process go buying process intel come back better graphic performance missing point driving market graphic performance drive market bay trail interesting device never going gaming pc performance could compete market bay trail discrete graphic really interesting proposition good enough cpu performance application put discrete graphic chip come back idea talked year ago optimized pc balance investment gpu cpu appropriately get good gaming machine much lower cost honestly see affecting attach rate one way could argue way right right guess conceivable going get inaudible atom use money support something else saving saving 40 5 going bay trail core get graphic card much okay look design win back half year seeing skus kind going towards bay trail seen past look point mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden unidentified participant chris evenden unidentified participant chris evendeni would want anticipate going go wait get wait get bit closer fair enough fair enough got ask demure fine question got one question inaudible mic inaccessible wondering guy see pcds risk potentially explosion inaudible potentially developer start dedicating resource gaming tablet phone risk inaudible development survey gamers gdc game developer gdc like month two month e3 48 developer said developing pc 55 said developing mobile 11 said developing console would say open gaming mobile pc growth area innovation happening excitement low number developing console next generation console come extraordinary inaudible mic inaccessible yes look like success early say whether failed whether whole console generation failed number seen market size suggest pc gaming 2015 20 billion business playstations together half 10 billion xboxes together half 5 billion mike mcconnell chris evendenthe thing pc gaming little revenue go package software sale easy walk game stop think well pc gaming dead something like 80 software revenue directly online whether buying game online whether subscribing game online whether getting game free app process whether whatever mechanism 20 packaged revenue packaged software revenue pc gaming market vibrant extremely healthy large part success shown margin forth last couple year pressure mobile guess sense think also synergy well certainly seem seems console suffering pressure pc come bunch gaming strategy allows u build synergy strong going say redoubt probably poetic fortress pc gaming build synergy actually translate success mobile gaming well shield device example stream game pc someday great grid climb thing allow u build similarly strong fortress defensible profitable fortress tegra business mobile moving opex always run comment jensen saying believe company opex problem got revenue problem said though believe 45 company revenue right opex percentage rev plan type relief opex going forward company still investment mode lot leverage model choose rationalize opex even slight extent think karen jensen pretty clear earnings call think hit somewhere close 1.6 billion target year wo 1.600 billion close enough claim straight face hit target right mean plan make cut opex end year still think lot tegra think point want seriously consider endangering future revenue investing appropriately plan yet still believe tegra look tegra tegra year doubt lot reason primarily failure one ecosystem jensen alluded call tegra 4 late made diﬃcult decision conscious decision delay tegra 4 could bring tegra 5 tegra 4i product track schedule demonstrated logan probably become mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnelltegra 5 demonstrated logan siggraph last month showed game changer term graphic performance real discontinuity mobile gaming mobile ap thing ready beginning next year lot leverage topline well grow topline beginning next year good place well though important getting lte working good still win ap anymore lte importance multiple speaker think lte pretty important know going qualification discrete mode i500 integrated part tegra ivi qualification going according plan progressing quite nicely nothing really report actually certified going fine may actually see i500 device back half year tegra 4i certainly next year simply long product take come market ready think people sometimes miss great year last year tegra 160 million without modem think competed last year tremendous headwind right fact company could buy lte modem tegra top competitor miracle made business last year unless really something special believe tegra space going forward though going watching lte quite closely though going pretty much mandatory checklist inaudible know mandatory connected tablet device put combo chip certainly think cellular conductivity going certainly increase especially carrier coming reasonable pricing plan pay twice pay extra every extra device question well need obviously discus licensing deal big change company strategy maybe give u chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evendenupdate think first licensee announced could start see royalty type customer going fun stuff part market accessible tegra whether vertically integrated oem whether market area resource go inaccessible tegra chip monetize ip market answer licensing people build chip smart tv might another one market looked last year decided big enough u go directly hand come really good chip enable someone else go market fantastic would lovely get one large vertically integrated oems inaudible new market well another way monetizing tegra regard timeline little way think someone want license call today would start building chip would bring chip would put chip device bring device market really 18 month two year probably something like mean know way strategy unless find someone main thrust licensing agreement thrust find people infringe patent take closer look would start generating could start generating revenue rather quickly thing announce announce also getting question lately intel royalty screen quite sizable look earnings contribution year confidence 2016 get renewed guy thought started talking think diﬃcult predict legal sort negotiation conducted lawyer probably 2015 take step back explain deal deal core agreement sue understanding got whole bunch clever engineer working advanced processor technology intel got whole bunch clever engineer working advanced processor technology pretty inevitable point going come idea want constantly looking shoulder worrying infringed somebody else patent right enter deal reason intel end paying u actually pay well lot le 66 one direction 6 direction per quarter reason end paying u lot revenue risk patent litigation mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evendenintel product could cost 55 billion year opposed 4 billion year would cost u get patent know running low time quick agreement date back 2004 entered exchange right build chipsets intel reneged u would see reneged agreement took court end paying u right chipset going forward 2016 agreement end still bunch engineer working patent also bunch engineer working patent still danger treading toe never predict anything ca predict anything core inaudible better probability high think see okay okay think time thank much chris appreciate thanks mike
