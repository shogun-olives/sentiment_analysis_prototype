feature team last year excited hearing customer yes start first first feature conceived produced rolled pandemic call together mode tell story together mode like talk reaction people first first saw graphical user interface xerox parc year year ago rudimentary looked little cartoony people sure going work vision realize saw gooey seeing future feel way together mode ground everyone together mode really based customer demand seeing first real fatigue using video conferencing product literally making people tired know went work started realize put tax brain person quite know second thing found people hard time connecting kind brady bunch square view based pulled expert looked learned virtual reality realize could use ai kind cut people background place shared background sort different shared background meeting room auditorium even coffee shop lined next science gone back done science actually tell u brain taxed le removed extraneous background information much easier brain process create connection people well think kind seeing future digital transformation kind digital innovation starting focused people connecting opposed getting sort like mechanical task done together mode far one favorite actually use tech way power nba national basketball association 60,000 fan attended 170 nba game together including shaq president obama proud could see tech used way connect people q brad alan zelnick jared spatarobut would say addition type thing seen whiteboard example integration whiteboard team people could creative work really differentiator u becoming increasingly important

lot energy team right awesome look forward together mode used sound like would one step closer metaverse certainly something help reduce blood pressure le taxing something look forward using point maybe pivot within team wanted talk telephony opportunity get sense perspective size big actual opportunity strategy differ competitor like ringcentral think fairly well known would say point microsoft come ucaas space bet really proud standing gartner magic quadrant release recently leader leader leader ucaas magic quadrant well leader meeting magic quadrant definitely moment hope get chance talk little bit broadly team monetization phone system ability kind help customer move using team maybe chat platform meeting platform telephony u depends look market certainly look big hundred billion dollar tam guess would say would quote one customer met recently asking changing result pandemic thought stick customer said know realized work longer place go set activity need matter thought great way kind frame telephony opportunity u telephony think single workload think telephony integrated ﬂow work brieﬂy mentioned think work get done several activity weave q brad alan zelnick jared

moment went market kind innovation ﬂow work got really great stuff think offer first ph really streamline calling experience integrated right team experience save call recording onedrive sharepoint even thing like identify spam spam idea people calling number easily transfer call mobile desktop end user thing like call merge low data mode use calling different type situation enhanced reverse number lookup provide really powerful call control api capability organization see using integrate instance team directly call center application call center agent use telephony component team differentiator looking platform support work ﬂows different activity telephony one component think important sometimes census group people meeting together sometimes specialized application like call center always dial tone available see awesome opportunity continue walk customer stack awesome earlier talked compromising across different activity function within broader umbrella team offer come customer perhaps already zoom slack example customer conversation different exactly value proposition yes start saying definitely see dual usage place earn customer business every day actually earn individual user level satisfied experience even instance centralized inaudible however see kind thematically dual usage play strength time end user level integration team offer single app thing competitor offer ability chat call meet content collaborating work together even integrate process automation work power platform single app user definitely feel drawn simplification workﬂow one thing start talk decision maker within organization think great value prop cost saving immediately come perspective gravitational pull platform think q brad alan zelnick jared spatarothere lot economic value platform offer combination calling meeting chat much cheaper price could going try go assemble thing pulling together separate player putting addition still cost saving beyond per user per month type saving typically going integration identity across different service provider also going look carefully thing like security compliance built conversation good think dual use play favor love get

customer say think back different platform emerge one one life time remember well day carry ﬂip phone palmpilot mp3 player awesome fantastic technology platform gravitational pull meant going subsumed smartphone put thing together could amazing thing created platform could three thing people could build n particular case apps able take advantage capability platform think thing happening right right think team greatest example think scaffolding think platform certainly love would call workload q brad alan zelnick jared spatarochat meet collaborate call even excited people continue use platform use thing like power platform build process automation customized apps really interesting thing yes think going continue see basic form consolidation happen industry excited feel like got jump trying
