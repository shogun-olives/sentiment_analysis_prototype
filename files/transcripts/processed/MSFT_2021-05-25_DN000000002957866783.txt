service somebody supply chain able predict thing like customer sentiment selling customer might happening supply chain may potentially harmful supply chain new world application proactive service data use intelligence able really empower people unique way dynamic approach intelligence new modern intelligent application proactive nature sound like skillful way leveraging lot common core service microsoft stack think starting understand power platform one going become one layer interestingly recent microsoft partner survey power alysa taylorplatform product rated almost strong azure term product momentum microsoft partner seeing surprised think understanding span across rpa virtual agent power bi analytics would describe possible role product future someone audience put hand yet power platform look like role going driving growth absolutely could tell think power platform go back saying sort take approach data service talked dynamic underpins team power platform aim power platform simply put tool hand closest problem mean think old world application development much developer enterprise developer would long period time build enterprise application meet need organization apps needed developer still scarcity market developer thing like power apps development platform make closest problem whether see something like look great example pandemic shutdown store went limited capacity resource planning putting employee needed store able manage capacity constraint operation manager built application using power apps waiting enterprise developer central build application would taken month year happened day operation manager able example putting tool hand closest problem power apps power bi thing aggregating data disparate data source people like financial analyst able easily aggregate data analyze visualize able act data business intelligence thing citizen analyst people considered developer able use tool able analyze visualize act data power automate robotics process automation business process automation tooling exact hearing theme right allowing people quickly able automate manual task thing take lot time drain productivity able quick easy way type statement able automate data take lot repetitive nature happens organization every day power automate announced springtime making power automate available window user really getting tool hand q mark murphy alysa taylorthose user able automate whatever test deem manual repetitive think seeing guess seeing sentiment survey viral ph nature explosive ph doubling monthly active user base across power platform regular basis user right organization standardizing tool groundswell user using best explanation heard power platform thank helping make become tangible want switch gear bit big portion role includes global industry concept noticed talking cloud focus microsoft think part mentioned past concept data model many u trying understand notion mean done sort engineer enable yes always approach company would call sort product vertical product capability bring life first instantiation microsoft cloud healthcare came general availability fall precisely right another product healthier product data model connector apps workﬂows specific vertical example virtual business healthcare right back kind world virtual care exploded overnight microsoft cloud healthcare actually use portal capability microsoft power apps able aggregate patient data able understand kind input data workﬂow predetermined workﬂow brings microsoft team caregiver clinician actually see patient information fingertip actually create team virtual visit predetermined rather build workﬂows common data model allow easily stand patient portal able workﬂows bring team able see data stand virtual consult type type capability building came general availability microsoft cloud healthcare announced four industry cloud capability retail able curbside pickup contactless shopping manufacturing build digital factory process process automation factory ﬂoor looking discrete donor management capability financial service thing like loan management workﬂows actually take loan origination move quickly loan lifecycle q mark murphy alysa taylorincreasing decreasing lead time getting loan originated hand lending type type workﬂows specific vertical capability bringing market microsoft cloud industry way think workﬂows apis connector bring vertical relevance across microsoft cloud unique like look somebody like salesforce industry cloud sits crm system right versus industry approach lighting entirety microsoft cloud service integrating vertical relevance capability across cloud platform business process layer collaboration layer see okay core differentiation alysa since mentioned patient portal healthcare maybe pretty good segue try talk proposed acquisition nuance thinking prof despite everyone best effort one able accurately predict microsoft next move term one predicted really past something seeing must helping accelerate roadmap wondering going completely specific healthcare could take nuance core ip ph instance strong voice recognition help strengthen azure voice recognition right believe nuance also biometric user authentication take apply across many vertical absolutely start healthcare go expanded use case healthcare talked enable physician like enable physician productivity talked power platform common theme lot heavy lifting caregiver give term transcription nuance unique way bring transcription service notion ambient intelligence able improve clinician physician productivity also use intelligence able provide greater care really glad keeping toe acquisition really think want acquire acquiring future provides unique value healthcare institution going forward notion physician productivity better care nuance incredible ability healthcare space point also rich portfolio voice recognition voice transcription play large set scenario talked customer service transcription voice recognition improve thing like interaction customer service agent customer set fraud dynamic 365 fraud protection using nuance capability really augment portfolio predict fraud happens security biometrics incredible asset kind q mark murphy alysa taylorcoming together help organization predictive bolstering security fraud protection sort largely across transcript capability enormous amount capability productivity suite well integrating dynamic azure communication service lot different thing enterprise workload known enterprise portfolio nuance driving portfolio healthcare side really
