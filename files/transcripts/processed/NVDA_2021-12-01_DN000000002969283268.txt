good afternoon everybody aaron rakers hardware semiconductor analyst well fargo extremely pleased host conference call knovio conference call virtual meeting nvidia manuvir da head nvidia enterprise computing business get discussion get think simona jankowski ir team wanted read quick disclaimer statement yes thank aaron hosting u quick reminder presentation contains statement investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business perfect good deal manuvir thank joining u lot delve nvidia company fire data center business great opportunity speak key trend maybe level enterprise computing increasingly diverse think talked bluefield product past maybe level set discussion real quick overview responsibility within company go question q aaron rakers manuvir dasyeah thank much aaron behalf nvidia pleasure nvidia operate one nvidia one business people ceo think owner particular business right peer report jensen three different thing one responsible product case responsible dgx ﬂagship server ai well egx mainstream hardware built oem partner gpus responsible software side gpu accelerated data science software well new push grade software ai making available enterprise customer sort middleware ai one way thinking role second way serve course different customer segment customer segment focus really enterprise customer particular work outside public cloud lot work public cloud finally perhaps importantly call think different area nvidia strategy part work jensen push democratize ai across enterprise company mean really move thousand enterprise company using ai today hundred thousand actually right really mission question answer yeah great overview exactly topic want hit ai adoption becoming clear move well beyond hype cycle right important driver business underpinning productivity growth many instance across different vertical think nvidia recently mentioned think 25 25,000 company using nvidia ai inferencing globally think next next step enterprise adoption go product thing involved really look democratize adoption rate yeah great question aaron clarify statement made 25,000 number using nvidia ai technology general training inference right use cloud use building right think aaron think inﬂection point right inﬂection point okay describe three different way one way thinking success ai date company particular vertical clear use case related business example online shopping site need recommend next thing somebody buy healthcare company q aaron rakersresearch drug discovery specific use case lot success see adoption continue think inﬂection horizontal use case example conversational ai way create chatbots customer service matter industry company long interacting customer benefit chatbot communicate customer think first inﬂection moving vertical use case horizontal use case one think second inﬂection think ai journey company training come first inﬂuence come next training process hire data scientist researcher say okay take ai show produce model help business work done company get hardest step willing put production use business inference done fact look across enterprise base find lot company today done training stage early inference actually putting production think next year think see dramatic change ﬂood company get stage actually using ai production deploying inference think second way thinking inﬂection think third way thinking inﬂection perhaps little today talk enterprise company using ai need understand ai need learn ai training inference going forward think see company adopt ai transparent manner mean application use today vendor right maybe document editing platform like oﬃce 365 erp system vendor say hey new version thing guess infused ai better great example know editing word today start typing sentence suggest completion sentence using ai case company adopting learn ai technology deploying next version existing product infused ai vendor learned ai worked nvidia adopt ai rather end customer right really true marketization make easy everybody adopt think three different way think journey forward enterprise ai latter point kind dovetail question infusion ai application layer necessarily say hey application layer going increasingly need parallel compute accelerated compute underneath hey application infused ai run processor effectively historical application kind curious know sits manuvir da q aaron rakers manuvir da q aaron rakers manuvir dasyeah key phrase use effectively yes inference certainly run server cpu increasingly case effective way term cost performance capability run inference gpus training inference believe server regular server data center gpus application running server infused ai benefit significantly gpu server different saying graphic work graphic cpu versus discrete gpu perhaps case way effective gpu right different application infused ai already see benefit greatly gpu server trend going get dramatic aaron ai model used within application becoming larger larger complicated gpu really make big difference yeah one question often come back nvidia think last earnings call jensen mentioned 10 server deployed globally today incorporated gpu going kind tie two question together comment also made time majority server could deploy gpu talk enterprise one right seem like traditional enterprise going big gpu attach rate missing ai workload running cloud run data center guy see yeah great question great one unpack number one absolutely case today look many server shipped new server shipped going enterprise data center server gpus percentage right case today expect change dramatically reason way today general mental model need special kind server ai server pack gill gpus put four gpus eight gpus server bespoke thing server cost 10,000 server cost 100,000 200,000 q aaron rakers manuvir da q aaron rakerslike ferrari buy one better running ai 24/7 wasted money general model penetration shift working customer taking server server would put inside vmware farm server would rack stack data center multipurpose server run sap put database take 10,000 server put one gpu cost thousand dollar got server one hand run traditional workload using regret modestly priced server hand also run accelerated workload like ai multipurpose server begin happen expect drive significant shift percentage mainstream volume server begin ship gpus jensen said fully expect fullness time become standard look enough year majority server gpus gpus journey right think fundamental point difference headed today ai server gpus bespoke putting corner data center serve one purpose whereas server working oems along software built multipurpose new workhouse data center new server going rack stack every new footprint build footprint reason workload run data center going require gpu infused ai need acceleration yeah interesting point right think lot investor talk look point eight gpus average term training four maybe referencing really talking somewhat elasticity bringing price point drive coupled application ecosystem evolving ai infusion absolutely right aaron elasticity price point elasticity usage point work vmware right already farm server administered via vmware shared different user different workload data center ai taught another workload data scientist thought another set user come access pool team able expand pool naturally use case right work vmware manuvir da q aaron rakers manuvir dasso driven bunch question add going kind try keep script little bit involve entail nvidia far strategy company responsible dgx egx mentioned evolve path environment elasticity start drive attach rate gpus want full provider type environment ecosystem yes absolutely want careful answering question also want miscommunicate yeah nearly people done best work creating hyperscale tenant compute environment public cloud done fantastic job really changed computing quite significantly deep partnership work closely case providing hardware software incorporate cloud right provide hyperscale environment said modern datacenter regardless whether enterprise data center colo cloud going look like trying shared environment compute storage networking used multiple application industry evolved nvidia committed provider okay mean hardware networking middleware software operating system infrastructure well ai software run top absolutely working front company platform company mean happy interact people level acquire hardware build everything else top going acquire middleware software ai software top acquire ai software go right happy work level certainly viewpoint look like working full stack make available different way example announced program year working equinix already customer equinix data center choose consume learn build reason aaron important problem accelerated computing easy optimize different part stack together order get best benefit give small example think ai produce model model q aaron rakers manuvir da q aaron rakers manuvir dasbe large split model actually inference think hardware capability server smart software split mark isolation one without done work together yeah great overview touched little bit ai launched product equinix thing done think tagline democratization ai announced product ai enterprise software suite yes help u appreciate believe subscription license think democratizing ai ultimately representing pretty attractive reportable soft ph revenue stream company yeah excited nvidia ai enterprise course revenue stream foresee excited think excited mean enterprise company right put way one barrier ai adoption today enterprise company think start first barrier ai software complex diﬃcult create huge ecosystem today provide piece piece et cetera largely diy effort coble software together ai reason created nvidia ai enterprise said nvidia actually built software spent year building software matured software package together say enterprise company procure piece business software everything need support sla like window like vmware vsphere platform operating system ai go deploy server data center first point make easier adopt ai second point think dilemma gap ai enterprise today two persona data scientist data scientist research creating new model jupyter notebook every night tweak data little bit get better model like model right one yesterday hand got people control data center importantly people accountable software running production business depends something happens software tomorrow q aaron rakers manuvir daswhether compromised functioning board want know happened right company reputation suffering two distinct entity early adoption ai data scientist essentially worked around either done work cloud built environment going forward break gap somehow truly democratize ai built nvidia ai enterprise way said enterprise business creating farm compute workload user nvidia ai enterprise thing add farm compute farm ready ai go data scientist researcher say come ai work compute farm able provide center excellence everybody come get resource one place working together take result work put production work vmware basically integrated nvidia ai enterprise vmware vsphere admin familiar vmware today say okay create template different kind spin vms vm farm easily create template say data scientist jupyter notebook template come use one good go second reason give great example aaron know nvidia enterprise available generally couple month general availability obviously initial traction success one highlight without name meet economical example shift expecting saw team read nvidia enterprise contacted u got launchpad experience setting ai environment happy set went data science team said look set environment come try tell u good enough brought data scientist used spun jupyter notebook et cetera said great exactly want team came back u procurement software loop outside ai adoption actually part serving ai data scientist kind expectation yeah remind real brieﬂy licensed yeah chose license based way vmware license vsphere product done today based top vmware vsphere licensing model roughly speaking 2,000 per year per superior socket okay license model familiar q aaron rakers manuvir da q aaron rakers manuvir daswith vmware say actually look much like pricing vmware vsphere also model way term support period sla point view procurement feel like natural extension simple way thinking 2,000 per cpu socket per year subscription basis yeah perfect couple topic little bit time left want touch written lot still feel like investor fully either understanding appreciative another layer acceleration idea disaggregation talked bluefield past yeah remind u see bluefield data processing unit evolve might see inﬂection think tied project monterey vmware importance think thing next couple quarter yeah put way right modern data center discussed right multiple people workload sharing equipment world infrastructure becoming zero trust mean ca put firewall outside let everybody party inside every application every user every workload must thought adversary respect everything else running data center turn order properly support environment need capability dpu really feasible way tractable way implementing trust environment amount information going across network process analyze manage eﬃciently create secure environment requires capability actual processing networking interface believe regardless whether public cloud colo enterprise data center trend clear every server dpu order part secure environment right keen dpu notice aaron talk dpu bluefield talk bluefield 2 current bluefield talk bluefield 2 bluefield 3 bluefield 4 journey inﬂection whole industry going go going take multiple generation hardware software journey occur furthermore going lot different player system cyber security provider virtualization platform provider et cetera q aaron rakers manuvir da q aaron rakers manuvir dasand took approach dpu took gpu created sdk called doca idea software developer different area one way program dpu take advantage right otherwise piece silicon one thing would really able support use case think going convey believe dpu important think every server every server industry shifting environment going expensive going forward siloed environment like footprint one thing footprint another thing right going expensive going siloed going inﬂexible cloud shown beautiful thing cloud one pool infrastructure used multiple way winning proposition believe think point evolution disaggregation accelerated architecture isolation evolution roadmap mentioned bluefield 2 bluefield 3 bluefield 4 eventually involves actually convergence gpu dpu together think theoretically maybe inﬂection really driving know elasticity thing converge think may happens quicker yeah think happens quicker reﬂecting come back think talked vmware project monterey right way think inﬂection happening vmware project monterey server dpu inside lot work enforcing security et cetera put onto dpu actually server run fashion whereas cpu freed actually run workload happened today functionality gone software run cpu workload need run move dpu free cpu importantly dpu built way work much eﬃciently cpu right otherwise shifting problem yeah keen monterey aaron think going drive inﬂection next stage said uniquely nvidia addition gpu ai capability dpu take thing another q aaron rakers manuvir da q aaron rakers manuvir da q aaron rakerslevel use ai understand happening network directly network right okay necessarily convergence away gpu discrete component yeah okay perfect helpful final two minute know two minute probably way short talk omniverse enterprise think call probably nvidia recently metaverse play responsibility mean brief minute comment think mentioned interested providing software enterprise company offering omniverse called omniverse enterprise basically ph general availability seen great adoption super excited really omniverse way people collaborate 3d design work number people looking collaborate way massive 40 million people need kind collaboration created omniverse enterprise simple licensing model based subscription think term thousand dollar per person per year detailed information course document build simple math head opportunity also working something called omniverse avatar enterprise company creator user work company digital form within omniverse journey opportunity financially mean company right encouraging u aaron worked many year produce omniverse found year really pushed forward brought together newest enterprise traction amazing appetite thing quite amazing another one thing sit say theory conceptually hypothesis everybody going need going change every enterprise company also say term traction seen far certainly seems match hypothesis see great appetite interest omniverse enterprise yeah manuvir da q aaron rakers manuvir dasi keep going think unfortunately time manuvir appreciate helping u understand story little bit better thank much pleasure behalf nvidia thank much giving u opportunity discussion perfect great day yeah
