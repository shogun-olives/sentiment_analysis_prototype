guess go get started tee question get thing started maybe start talking core gpu business first guess nvidia took tremendous share gain especially notebook past couple year share historic high ﬂattish pc vertical basically guess ﬂattish pc vertical grow business without additional share gain share gain particularly kind stabilized certainly go idea fairly high level historically business still got plenty growth potential actually start asp increasing growing asp quite successfully secondly business growing sorry market growing well figure suggest pc software market growing 10 year obviously grow along pc gaming pc gaming one funny market quite diﬃcult analyze intuitively going gain stock one organization see little pc software shelf something like 80 pc gaming software revenue online whether software bought online marketplace like steam whether downloads online subscription warcraft increasingly seeing premium model free play model people actually pay purchase downloadable content lot revenue happens almost invisibly actually quite diﬃcult track organization tell u growing 10 year map growth pc gaming hardware near estimate figure figure industry rick schafer chris evendenso overall whole market growing asp growing interesting thing gpus generalize question gpu growth course got quadro tesla grid well three way monetizing ip specifically gpu ip quadro good business growing probably rate market well according itc 82 unit share estimate 90 dollar share anyway grow growing market bunch minister place grow market market grows recent data pmi data seem fairly positive encouraging fact encouraged trajectory quadro tesla well proving really interesting business probably familiar tesla computing business working know probably five year actually really feel right place going get sort inﬂection point gap always supporting enough code software application sort generally interesting developer big despite installation like example oak ridge national lab installation ten million dollar revenue background level smaller application quite small q2 saw q2 hairsbreadth away new revenue record notable thing none large deal actually background level purchase encouraging number reason firstly sustainable yes sound like fair steady inaudible secondly much lowered hutch business big supercomputer installation go primarily oems basically researcher scientist sitting thinking well want molecular dynamic modeling know nvidia accelerates code used wanted accelerated tesla rather go ibm say test accelerated machine inaudible le supercompute still supercomputing necessarily like massive installation like oak ridge national lab guy level clustered university pharmaceutical company small small supercomputer well probably come new name mini supercomputer something side business huge potentially huge think driving appears right scale much better way great getting business like oak ridge national lab marquee win generate lot win well lot people developing quota tight supercomputer oak ridge national lab want develop test system rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden rick schaferso generate lot business sense worth diﬃcult scale staff service 10 titan card win simultaneously whereas 100 small win absolutely ibm hp supermicro guy service biggest gating factor supercompute ramp side business software availability actually gating factor support yes okay broad software support mean broad base engineer scientist actually go longer debate longer introduce gpu acceleration people ever considered gpu acceleration conversation two year ago certainly conversation probably let help port code right whereas code ported right molecular dynamicist real job title someone molecular dynamic nova vmd namd amber code use application run accelerated gpus okay looked three year five year something new trying get sense big tesla could got inaudible sort stumbling block hurdle whatever want call sort way mean 1 billion kind business multiple speaker really diﬃcult value different way something already done think something like 10 million server year purchased would go parallel computing think came 2 billion tam one could attack get sense yes big business think good growth trajectory mean encouraged good quarter q2 think kind ongoing year order 200 million last year high end year probably okay back gpu second mean know biggest competitor discrete graphic space making noise recently potentially taking share year next desktop notebook think credible claim would would come think credible mostly kind desktop kind competing integrated graphic stuff chris evenden rick schafer share interesting ca get market share data right inaudible publishes market share data data good bear mind unit share dollar share different ﬂat triangle like look market lot low value lot look like significant share change think q3 last year actually lost unit share gaining dollar share could see opposite thing remember data data well ﬂuctuates lot inventory getting channel said still data something look would look basis would look annualized basis actually pay unfortunately market research data data proprietary data actually ﬂat inaudible annual cycle cadence data share gain think amd done reasonably well cpu side thing recently certainly help gpu attach otherwise think reason mentioned think share probably surprisingly high q1 like 68 65 notebook probably risk share really honest term channel ﬂuctuation seeing seem major reason share change hand particularly balance year think visibility notebook design win example feel pretty good think think share going change hand particularly yes skus change hand people like engage debate oh got sku lost sku think get start getting level granularity lose big picture reason expect share change hand particularly nobody particularly mean think notable last year lack pricing pressure space historically seen pricing pressure gpu mean seems like may skewed lower end seen much mean guess sound like kind predicted continuation pretty benign pricing environment mean anybody surprisingly robust amd came market aggressive bundling strategy promoting actually react pricing anticipated would react actually little effect share despite reason act pretty benign pricing environment mean see go forward much rational year yes actually good good lead gross margin question mean guy done great job expanding gross margin think 400 basis point 500 basis point last four quarter five quarter math right maybe five quarter six quarter chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer yes multiple speaker curious mean sustainable level think drove know mix probably something yes lot factor mean good question lot factor mean previous peak gross margin think 46.3 year ago recent climb actually go back longer five quarter go back probably two year climbing time amd weak product market strong product okay think product better pc market well known fairly weak yet 10 whole point higher previous record right mix quadro grown lot particularly since inaudible profitable business u mix within geforce actually dynamic market changed notebook weak whole notebook market weak notebook business smaller relative desktop gaming pc gaming said strong business got profitable healthy growing business within pc market know many company claim whether semiconductor company hard drive company whoever right reality gaming resilient business continuing grow successful probably two main hour growing course lot done term running business eﬃciently hood reducing waste thing like simple thing build chip process catch faulty costlier point much catch many early thing like thing structural thing improved gross margin significantly time asp business loss said know obvious reason sustainable absent obvious thing like price war thing hope would never happen structural reason would continue quadro continues grow tesla growing quite strongly huge lift margin grid lift margin start contribute meaningfully ﬂip side think netbook growing anytime soon probably ﬂat best worst gross margin business seeing structurally point margin maintained tegra grows chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evendenthat next question right right tegra chip business little bit copra average massively little bit inaudible handle gross margin little bit lower corporate average much lower drag obviously shield small contributor price obviously lower well thing grow still okay yes one thing note nvidia company know gm inaudible gm traditional way value semiconductor company right look gross margin trajectory buy sell large part business development semiconductor pure semiconductor shield one right grid another tesla another well even quadra selling board huge software component well chip business traditional sense business business grow traditional way tracking gm using buy sell indicator probably le useful sell forecast sell 1 million share year pull gross margin extremely good way right made awful lot money selling share take nuance business think right since talking tegra mean guess starting high level great growth trajectory since guy introduced always seems kind fall little short expectation mean given year know year particular struggle first half guess curious like piece puzzle missed mean like gaining full suite like connectivity piece puzzle help sell relatively new channel historically big player rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden multiple speaker actually think one miss tend done inaudible expectation think set expectation highly look last year mentioned chip business new gp new tegra fsc like reporting segment 540 million 760 million let take first 540 million 0.5 billion business good business extremely good business continue ramp year diﬃcult year certainly revenue change year put politically correct way result couple diﬃcult decision made last year made conscious decision take resource away tegra 4 put tegra project logan tegra 4i knowing tegra 4 going right place win key tablet win year going knew hit hot revenue year felt right thing perspective got project logan demoed siggraph know running much aggressive time scale tegra 4 chip right place win key key tablet win see could see revenue certainly early first half next year put great place tegra 4i mainstream smartphone chip like integrated modem going qualification progressing fine going process ready product first half next year well really sampling trial sampling already okay something since february happened call way process worked phone manufacturer actually build phone chip deciding whether want actually buy happening parallel getting chip qualified carrier effectively chip level phone handset oem take phone build decided want take market start qualifying qualification well bring market lengthy process right chip start sampling mid february least rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evendena year product get market aspect least sometime next year hopefully okay production risk multiple speaker back half year mean tegra 4 finally available device starting ship hp toshiba couple others fact tegra 3 device started shipping 149 tablet hisense could good volume runner well number product back half year see well yes saw company yesterday primarily sale china based made claim believe half tablet unit anyway next year could produced sort white box market know kind bless basically white box market tablet could bigger samsung apple combined yes fact number going big certainly large number analyst least unit think speaking unit multiple speaker yes find way find way found way hitting competitive price point tegra 4 well certainly service market yes diﬃcult audible certainly many ten million unit bunch sale strategy address scalable way obviously spread something like 100 200 different manufacturer actually find clearly ca sale engineering team inaudible rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden inaudible okay number recently read 100 200 yes thousand impossible impression consolidating somewhat going direction whatever hundred oems find scalable way address various strategy place historically strong obviously cited know thought share share would kind market know tougher question multiple speaker yes share need grow business share becomes useful metric u think mean moment design win metric look business know talked tegra little slightly corporate average mean would kind business let say take would create bigger drag would way cost offset business took would drag multiple speaker address find way addressing profitably three point going business chip margin going 30 something would take really profitable mean company compete price feature performance however price always part equation find way adding feature way increase cost example directstylus feature announced well couple month ago actually allows add stylus small bom cost opposed estimate galaxy note stylus technology cost 20 fraction thing like share saving like manufacturer mean still command premium tegra got extra value still hit good bom cost device would way ever discussed internally potentially couple biggest tablet smartphone guy smartphone apple samsung two guy obviously sort feel like kind core guy stuff think done lot innovation mentioned one thing right stylus would ever able go license apple know mean get revenue way rick schafer chris evendenwe love yes absolutely mean licensing business formalized technology kept design way make licensable call future course maxwell similarly licensable clearly love one bigger manufacturer like apple samsung license technology fairly talking try raise think command premium term technology put gpu come investment put r look competitor imagination technology clearly make 200 million year devoted half r 100 million gpu r year right spend north 1 billion year r pretty good gpu result mean reality feature performance performance per watt performance per millimeter square last one particularly interesting debate licensing technology command premium licensing core save customer money foundry level performance smaller piece silicon share saving customer give u premium core right business early day still lot could quite interesting yes well mentioned r curious mean talk tegra print mean would assume spending outsized proportion r development particular vertical versus outsized meaning bigger rev yes interesting look way allocating cost come way report auditor happy one thing talked analyst day took tegra together much would save r number actually smaller amount get covered allocate actually lot synergy business kepler cost originally geforce call geforce work low power mean low power extremely important even geforce fact would say everywhere power constrained gentle way say performance per watt performance every single one business power constrained even supercomputing business limit much power put server server box server rack limit data center actually constrained amount power actually get big cable go inside like constraint much performance get megawatt throwing side placement everything power constrained mean power consumption important whether developing tegra chip whether developing geforce chip synergy mean gpu rick schafer chris evenden q rick schafer q unidentified participant chris evenden q unidentified participant chris evendenarchitecture process technology stuff mean incremental cost tegra actually lower report way make tegra yes work together think way another way monetizing ip already two chip gpu soc monetize bunch way across bunch different market okay guess last question since mentioned server know past said like going space yes might first area focus think changed never say never first answer secondly offering data center compute differentiation right looking general performance general computing server like hadoop server something like would add value see u computing application computer everything see u big data application like shavan well really back end computer application make lot sense well general purpose like dense server leave amcc amd calxeda cavium intel well mean going really quite competitive market think let stick really strong differentiator market way question answer okay think got five minute question anybody got anything sorry talked already desk computer geforce business yes market going kind attach rate market share pc unit growth general think outlook yes address right beginning actually q unidentified participant chris evenden q unidentified participant chris evenden q unidentified participant chris evenden q unidentified participant chris evenden q unidentified participantsorry really brieﬂy pc market diﬃcult market pc gaming great market franchise built pc gaming market pc gaming whole probably grows 10 year built strong franchise pc gaming allows u build continue grow profitable business fact actually extend strategy mobile well one point make earlier thing like could build similarly defensible profitable mean calling niche sound funny big niche effectively right gaming niche inside pc market base completely differently rest pc market something strong profitable position well mobile market successful u device like shield initiative like grid traditional product base like geforce work together took earnings call brieﬂy lot synergy build profitable franchise inaudible attach rate discrete gpus holding constant rising going see unit dropping 10 think year yes respect trend asp separate mobile okay answer really quickly attach rate approximately ﬂat pc gaming growing right notebook shrinking pc gaming desktop gaming growing 10 year know third question forgotten share asp share asp share moment probably pretty stable asp growing okay business grows chris evenden q unidentified participant chris evenden q unidentified participant chris evenden q unidentified participant chris evenden think grow gpu business desktop grow quite nicely notebook probably whole market gaming well right thing drive purchasing notebook gpus driven oem desire differentiate laptop different mechanic market thanks talk decision license ip graphic instead chip instead well well yes addition sorry decide revenue opportunity getting le dollar obviously higher gross profit maybe ca tegras everything still want proliferate graphic yes last point key one place ca wo take tegra still bring value ip company chosen strong reason ideological reason want build chip extremely strong graphic ip portfolio mentioned earlier thousand pound extremely good cause well address market way vertically integrated oem one obvious market new market box smart tv resource go company could really benefit stronger marquee client started test comp yes short answer expect u announce necessarily soon depends customer would want get client today would want say oh going client nvidia think answer probably probably want keep ready launch would like think would see competitive advantage device producing gpu weight gpu might see customer tomorrow license chip code would build chip code would take chip put device bring device market could two year even ask someone tomorrow could raising inaudible could two year hear q unidentified participant chris evenden q rick schafer chris evenden q unidentified participant chris evendenis likely similar model imagination like 0.30 forgot like 0.30 chip something also upfront license fee similar like arm would want talk model mean allude previous conversation rick mentioned think command premium save money foundry way mint money result royalty kind thing license royalty kind thing yes likely mean depends business financial license customer want think price inaudible microphone inaccessible workstation business question workstation business growing workstation business showing strong growth last couple quarter guess mentioned earlier 82 market share according idc estimate 90 dollar share diﬃcult grow business without growing whole market number initiative place like maximus grow market grid actually grow market vca vgx outside market data fairly promising 80 revenue driven manufacturing pmi data good auto manufacturing data good see go grid point announced year supported natively xendesktop 7 mean anyone considering citrix implementation today also look effect gpus hardware see benefit much easier becomes initiative software supported automatically working bunch citrix star 150 trial place think 12 dozen var working active engagement thing typical project implementation proposition early indicator pretty good vmware show later month think actually working closely well get supported natively way supported natively citrix another growth initiative quadro q rick schafer chris evenden q rick schafer chris evenden great perfect time right thanks lot chris coming okay thanks thanks giving u time appreciate thanks rick
