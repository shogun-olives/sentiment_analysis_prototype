understand category driving consumer makeup within driving growth sure well mostly benefiting higher growth grocery right food consumables customer wallet pinched certainly see discretion larger ticket item looking value value convenience seen share gain notably grocery think income demographic seeing pretty dispersed across three income tier follow earlier going back last year seeing higher inﬂation skewed higher income group think recently evenly dispersed among income group important thing greg q greg melich john david rainey q greg melich john david raineythat value also convenience continue see robust growth thing like delivery store people buying something online picking store providing convenience customer think importantly contrast lot trend saw throughout pandemic trend good reason like went pandemic reverted back trend line area business specifically talking grocery delivery buying online picking store picking store continued go right throughout pandemic one thing look weekly average customer count customer last quarter talked 40 year well way several quarter go back four year ago consistent trend right think really show much convenience value interesting maybe follow value side get convenience would frame price gap today versus 12 month ago versus competition comfortable price gap today think case last three maybe four quarter certainly go back multiple year ago think recognition needed invest area needed invest pricing done operate dynamic competitive environment going continue best customer best walmart may take change time time see period step change investment area something look every monday morning meeting monitoring price versus competition stand today feel comfortable got mission impossible theme shareholder day maybe follow little bit walmart help reduce inﬂation rollback go historically term number across store category yes start maybe steph might want jump rollback piece working recognize first like headline inﬂation number

melichour mission provide best pricing customer work supplier try make happen also got big private brand business walmart u.s. roughly 20 little bit ahead greater 20 sale private brand item sam closer 30 good vehicle able provide value customer steph want talk little bit rollback yes think john david point working closely supplier vendor particularly dry grocery across overall grocery consumables basket directed use rollback dollar concentrating around major event know consumer looking u fight inﬂation even harder recall even last fall started campaign would effectively digest inﬂation consumer thanksgiving meal last year price holiday basket last year value carried way spring marketing campaign proven really effective u driving customer engagement also reinforcing position think gaining goodwill among consumer right addition overall working closely supplier make sure dollar effective drive volume need well continuation working going see get back half year back school really important point u reinforce value proposition see continue fall holiday season maybe frame little bit think heard number week ago hundred rollback think typically 90 day past remember thousand walmart rollback period time kind magnitude could increase next month yes think john furner said last couple week ago shareholder event could see doubling back half know would put 10x multiplier okay definitely direction guess maybe pivot little bit john david mentioned value also convenience right thought one thing saw recently pickup 2.0 also delivery john david rainey q greg melich john david raineymentioned follow really getting traction initiative yes well lot also automating supply chain whether automated storage retrieval fulfillment center store micro fulfillment center making lot eﬃcient u enabling u better serve customer reduce wait time accuracy term item picking basket continuing see consumer behavior shift direction recognize convenient process moreover think consumer

walmart lift 50 double disclosing number okay someway describe appreciably higher talking 10 50 much higher customer got well maybe think last 10 15 minute want get fun stuff like margin great drive traﬃc also good make money could get driver margin expansion talked get back goal growing ebit faster sale margin expansion talked really think drilled investor day talked growing margin much faster sale result number thing fundamentally mix business changing think 4 5 margin retail business growing low rate combine faster growing element business like advertising like fulfillment service like data venture even talking like going flipkart phonepe entity thing improving margin higher margin much greater rate growing faster pure mix business changing one element second piece moving gm moving channel marketplace seller allows u provide q greg melich john david rainey stephanie schiller wissinkassortment merchandise historically customer see customer coming buying gm tends carry higher margin food grocery third area greg really relates pure unit economics control delivering service good customer supply chain think best example point right making tremendous investment supply chain got opportunity see mentioned unit economics around fulfillment improve roughly 20 20 lower rather say five year complete next five year three year think going roughly 65 store served automation provides better experience integrity experience customer also lower unit cost expanding gm business grow faster improving unit economics service provide today thinking unit economics standpoint three four five year thinking supply chain cost coming 20 5 sale could 100 bps margin include store cost well maybe even 100 bps opportunity framing right opportunity excess 100 bps thinking absolutely right way applies fcs dc also store focus lot supply chain technology implementing technology like visbic system back electronic shelf label electronic shelf label save ton hour store course period like quarter needing go change manually automation really give u opportunity operate much eﬃciently allow associate best serve customer greg maybe finalize point associate expectation population associate would remain relatively ﬂat next several year expect see drawdown number people redeploying individual person different job upskilling good majority workforce place serving customer close proximity customer thing within automation sequence serving contributing overall technology real good opportunity associate well expecting major change overall headcount q greg melich john david rainey q greg melich john david rainey q greg melich hold go ahead sorry greg guess would say trend next question going basically invested lot labor last year think wage probably low double digit year ago probably year moderate back something normal way really get productivity labor true restate steph said slightly differently believe grow labor feel comfortable today whether average wage starting wage wage associate increased tremendously whether look period period definitely want continue pay associate appropriately average hourly wage view career like take stat like promotion 88 promotion position say filled store start filled people walmart associate going hiring someone street necessarily giving someone opportunity advance think really important people think wealth creation career growth walmart want go back point mentioned around margin said investor day expect next several year average sale grow 4 year may year may le average 4 said operating income grow faster clearly like talking like 5 5 disappointed showed range outcome think kind cleverly shaded graph upwards almost 8 think tremendous opportunity execute initiative control dramatically change margin profile company really translates increased free cash ﬂow better profit get capital allocation big opportunity walmart going forward great way tie together want make sure leave business mix part talked beginning john david rainey q greg melich john david rainey q greg melich john david raineyreasonable goal thing like medium business look percentage sale digital sale even frame opportunity way look internally think external metric around well looking percent gmv call roughly sale today look competitor maybe approach 10 people also dependent greg upon type item selling see advertising relates gm food going easier attract advertising dollar pair sneaker head broccoli take 9 10 kind high watermark industry people like u normalize mix business actually translates call roughly 6 using little bit crude math roughly 6 7 gmv aspiration u would put u top 10 probably advertiser u.s. next five year big opportunity opportunity beyond product sale vendor might already working maybe thinking example like would marriott hotel want advertise knowing somebody looking luggage yes absolutely think insignificant opportunity think importantly want make sure advertise way provides better experience customer want try monetize advertising dollar throw bunch stuff offer front customer relevant always going keep focus eye mission helping customer save money live better going probably little use little discretion certain area around advertising example relevant customer believe something want would want would absolutely consider something like got want go crazy whether slippery slope targeted make sense exactly q greg melich john david rainey q greg melich john david rainey great maybe last minute got get margin want make sure get return balance sheet cash ﬂow good stuff capex going think guy mentioned maybe close 20 billion matter framed get roi inﬂection yes let start way view capital allocation every dollar compete alternative right believe single best investment investing capex high roi around stated despite elevated level capex believe roi go every year good governor guardrail make sure telling investment community promise wait going spend money come several year later want demonstrate invest business seeing return investment go year go little bit year going go little bit year year based upon trajectory investment making said believe important balanced capital allocation includes returning cash shareholder form share repurchase dividend going aggressive appropriate think stock undervalued see u opportunistic believe always appropriate return cash shareholder share repurchase look plan plan economics around drive share gain much greater see today investing long term thinking way investor would also would aspire continue increase dividend dividend aristocrat increasing dividend number year point future able maybe hope step change increase even perhaps higher payout ratio today think important demonstrate come increasing margin increasing free cash ﬂow talk payout ratio percentage prior year earnings would think q greg melich john david rainey q greg melich john david raineyprior year earnings look historically go back 8 10 year vacillated range call probably appropriate business period time really targeted payout ratio policy say something targeted internally policy around opportunity u future want change send little different message street around thinking dividend maybe last part question optimal leverage ratio mean obviously lot change rate lot real estate fortress balance sheet number target yes yes generally target 2x leverage ratio aa credit rating provides u ﬂexibility whether respect using capital also considering thing like commercial paper think importantly u like tremendous amount opportunity think capital allocation always going looking lens creates value shareholder look leverage ratio today map graph like get lowest weighted average cost capital would suggest could lower marginally lose ﬂexibility really like roughly 2x leverage ratio aa credit rating make lot sense think time come close john david want appreciate time got lot 35 minute kary steph annoying figure remodeled store tour summit next year thank joining u great rest summer okay thank greg appreciate bye
