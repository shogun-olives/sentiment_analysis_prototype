ﬂexibility cost advantage even personal experience stood azure finance team four year back look back planning done really bullish time look back still envisioned number thing scenario seeing right azure increase addressable opportunity 3x number place getting additional incremental benefit earlier able address software component address hardware well service also address inaudible open closed

verizon provides fast secure reliable connection go internet drive number hybrid scenario similarly azure file streamlined storage think shared drive application running azure share file within multiple dm ph describes number hybrid scenario like sn dev ph lift shift diagnostic overall would say encouraging pace innovation fast gregg moskowitz vikas mehta gregg moskowitz vikas mehta great one one wanted ask actually new site recovery really enhanced asset recovery cloud azure seen recently actually player well putting couple competitor announced dr wanted get sense competitive landscape shaping really big opportunity may microsoft going forward would say business continuity uptime really critical enterprise seen traditionally solution disaster recovery solution limited application expensive second complex cloud provides real disruptive value creation opportunity regard disaster recovery done azure site recovery service given enterprise option recover replicate dm case outage primary data center azure providing automated fail alert three important differentiator first automation tool really good make easy creating solution second take lot cost help sort managing infrastructure end make cheaper department finally made job simple reduced lot complexity goal want enterprise disaster recovery application want comprehensive solution set extend application portfolio great one last one azure move another topic another service called remoteapp went preview last month know clearly good partnership citrix wondering would sort talk product extent guess question extent actually compete offering yes desktop management strategy perspective help centrally manage top environment provide security reliability ﬂexibility way productive help user access data anywhere device particular time gregg moskowitz vikas mehtaon side successful remote desktop server offering fact 1 billion business u customer consistently asking u similar service cloud azure remoteapp provide functionality manage based application centrally enable user access across device whether window io two advantage provide first help reduce cost scale scale depending need need invest expensive infrastructure secondly user accessing application two level ph application running machine rather cloud considering cloud service trading fast essentially bringing innovation regular basis finally would say partnering citrix area partner u continue okay let move actually people certainly really would call steady eddie frankly consistently put healthy growth continue sort grow faster market recently seen part sql server 2014 new inaudible capability maybe sort talk mean performance standpoint look product well kind potentially see new customer demand coming result capability think right sql server 2012 fantastic success u delivered higher market trade consistently taking share competitor area sql server 2014 build success sql server 2012 help u extend hybrid scenario importantly help u rounding capability three important differentiator first one capability built right sql server need buy additional hardware software second need really write application competitor push finally capability compatible prior technology well would say lead shift industry seeing good initial customer feedback gregg moskowitz vikas mehtaif think performance standpoint depends workload running seen customer oltp workload seeing 30 time performance improvement think data warehousing column store seeing almost 100 time performance improvement versus traditional option

experience comprehensive solution would say partnership extremely important keep working making reach easier standpoint perfect great pause take question question answer inaudible vikas mehta say let take first part question let repeat question move cloud change company working second impact sort operating margin may look first aspect fundamentally moving cloud mean shift dna company different business model different way working number new skill set need build need manage infrastructure scale need fast integrative term product development need agile term innovation example think earlier software world invest data center sale motion large degree channel partner providing service directly customer creates different dynamic creates dynamic need really focused customer experience need focused service aspect slas uptime etc. become extremely critical regard build lot new capability like building supply chain management process building agile development framework building team manage data center scale fashion also change sale promotion considerably earlier relationship say peer relationship customer whereas peer would go understand renew deal whereas ongoing relationship customer stay tune need keep innovating product well offer new service correct way fundamentally shift operate company sure look second part question scale operating margin would say important way look particular dynamic look operating margin dollar rather operating margin percentage reason different business model earlier selling software cost good sold operate data center capital intensive think operating margin dollar perspective move cloud offer significant opportunity azure mentioned 3 time bigger addressable opportunity earlier able address software able address hardware service monetize well creates newer scenario lot innovation new innovation happens would say operating margin dollar perspective definitely accretive u q unidentified participant vikas mehta q unidentified participant vikas mehta q gregg moskowitz q unidentified participant vikas mehta inaudible would say initial success wave enterprise predominantly enterprise already existing solution saw great success first wave seeing great success smb side also smb opportunity unique sense 85 customer smb one never used server offering oﬃce software productivity suite popular used across board think server offering like exchange sharepoint lync pretty extensive solution small midsized company oﬃce 365 becomes extremely affordable pricing ranging anywhere 4 per user per month 22 per user per month provides opportunity smb seen great adoption important stat would share lot sort net new opportunity 85 customer never used server workload inaudible good question would say smb customer said oﬃce predominantly used across board email solution use hosted email extent exchange server mostly able reach service provider provide much better experience exchange online solution could also like company typically end using consumer offering offer enterprise feature would say perspective able directly reach customer exchange online rather hosted provider part providing much richer experience enterprise offering rather pushing consumer offering definitely great opportunity great question inaudible q gregg moskowitz vikas mehtathe question part around nokia acquired nokia device service business excited business company vision around see lot opportunity connected device continuous service framework feel nokia fit really well microsoft provides u rich set capability around design hardware provides u rich supply chain well functionality outstanding retail play also expand hardware business across phone tablet pc work provider oems feel nokia great opportunity u question wondering could actually maybe talk big data opportunity power bi etc .. might see show time microsoft financials yes think one important revolution seeing regard data prior world saw two important revolution one improving productivity collaboration communication etc second one regard automation tool making easier current revolution see future regard working data inside think sort macro perspective number device increasing storage exploding ton data lacking ability mine data create insight strategy around big data twofold one help make big data accessible mean create platform run technology like hadoop scan process huge data inexpensively made hadoop available window azure call microsoft azure also tight integration sql server second part regard converting insight rich functionality power bi work seamlessly excel powerpoint creates solution top rich integration sharepoint create portal rich integration sql server provides enterprise reliability security need perspective would say twofold strategy create platform big data help word ph data insight power bi tool addition recently announced sap deal addition sort running sap application azure also announced integration business object power bi democratizing insight customer q gregg moskowitz vikas mehta q gregg moskowitz vikas mehta great actually take little bit segue wanted spend minute two could dynamic business growth bit slower past quarter everything hear dynamic crm online continues go extremely well wondering could talk business well dynamic ax erp side would say perspective feel move cloud really important move helped move step lot service addition azure crm dynamic online also definite beneficiary think tight integration offer oﬃce 365 dynamic crm azure definitely positive u see term sort attach fortune 500 company see cloud service adopted time rather would say crm perspective definitely pushing cloud offering aggressive erp perspective would say focused specific vertical dynamic ax classic example focused retail opportunity seeing good momentum would say overall perspective feel enthused opportunity perfect question let actually close one last big picture question could really something touched brieﬂy one earlier answer relates internet thing obviously starting see really sign opportunity beginning explode open debate obviously fast progress think microsoft asset would love hear big player internet thing could microsoft become time would say opportunity multifold u think computing perspective azure platform help connect device end day device whether screen without screen call internet thing azure definitely big beneficiary second around operating system think window embedded successful business side see u play sort think automobile market terminal screen successful site extending q gregg moskowitz vikas mehtawe talked lot inaudible recently window operating system cater internet thing revolution create across device side operating system regard connecting azure terrific vikas think time thank much thanks lot
