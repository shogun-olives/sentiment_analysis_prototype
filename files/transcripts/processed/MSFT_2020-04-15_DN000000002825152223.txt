hey good morning everyone welcome bloomberg intelligence webinar series topic today understanding risk due couple administrative note u today presentation recorded available playback access replay via link sent email bloomberg webinars bottom slide window adjust volume maximize screen ask question one side address question conclusion presentation quick word bloomberg intelligence provide research data company industry government credit esg cover close 2,000 company right 300 people part department established globally discussion today rising cybersecurity risk guest today nanda santhana pas introduce talk little bit seeing market space anurag ph hope everybody hear okay name nanda santhana run global head cybersecurity threat solution securonix going first walk guy little bit securonix company founded 2009 250 customer worldwide couple product produce today siem built cloud also offer security data lake essentially help customer gather data cloud ueba solution user entity behavior analytics solution also provide soar solution security orchestration response around 2009 product suite produce term topic hand today like brought anurag hundred million people working home result ongoing outbreak challenge see number one vpn remote access cloud anurag rana nanda santhanabyod device opened overnight employee contractor right especially vpn collaboration tool pushed maximum bandwidth basically mean kid home lot virtual schooling happening home bandwidth completely consumed corporate network side folk using lot video conferencing bandwidth completely full organization started expedite cloud adoption especially coronavirus pandemic folk work home overnight shifted towards using cloud email infrastructure apps little security testing even time taking assessment using cloud solution change happening side attacker side house hacker absolutely merciless taking advantage fact fear across globe capitalizing fear speak little bit speak thing happening see enormous high number spray spear phishing campaign spray spear phishing campaign essentially targeting individual specific class key message talk cure word like cure phishing event absolutely successful last thing notice often time cybersecurity world really talked damage unintentional data loss done employee contractor remember beginning said bandwidth completely utilized bandwidth completely utilized see employee contractor essentially downloading lot sensitive data right may look like usual going happen data document big question mark post pandemic net user laptop way see new perimeter need monitored respect challenge thing bring yeah go ahead anurag sorry nanda go ahead please trying figure attacker profile yeah definitely yeah think attacker see first traditional malware family also see anurag see lot employee contractor also put attacker bracket u damage cybersecurity damage done organization whether adversary outside employee contractor scenario even saw terminated employee essentially constitutes towards entire metric starting gather across engagement second question break thing think key thing see reason think pdf entire excel spreadsheet got converted pdf lost metric speak biggest challenge see see ton phishing campaign rise sure like said extremely crafty message hacker using attack individual definitely rise second big bracket see issue happening outside malwares essentially last three four week see close 72,000 domain created either word like corona variation start k whatnot research securonix spread research show least 8,000 malicious also see many top domain meaning rest domain potentially could used later malicious activity unfortunately metric showing clearly get back listener dig little bit deeper attack vector previous point see notorious coronavirus malware right malware domain registered earlier jan see lot covid related domain like said particular coronavirus tracker website front end look like like john hopkins university tracker back end essentially installing malware laptop user even realize domain continuing become big challenge especially employee contractor currently working home reason becoming challenge firewall rule user work within organization degree preventive control working home using byod device becoming much easier attacker essentially trick employee contractor click website continuing become challenge moving couple key thing want bring threat researcher guy probably must heard word called ransomware really rise seen one organization document look like weaponized document one organization unfortunately human resource executive click lock computer essentially asks sort monetary transaction via bitcoin ransomwares starting become big challenge organization especially right guy probably must seen news big issue one european hospital actually ransomware critical clinical system started create big inaudible institution essentially fix already dealing important thing hand right third thing talk probably applies everybody zoom attack think something definitely want move along everybody using zoom today think zoom starting address security concern seen already lot automated tool actually find meeting id lot academia lot virtual schooling hacked via method folk joined random meeting lot privacy concern started showing importantly research dark web see close 500,000 account dark web recommendation follow end basically make sure become victim zoom attack social medium collaboration tool attack definitely raise talked phishing campaign one key challenge see respect phishing message tuned going market today like one scenario one organization actually got fixed cdc ph phishing look phishing email able bring malware threat research lab essentially detonated interesting actually click link show fake one drive log one drive long exactly look like authentic one drive log essentially hacker collecting credential sending using whatever malicious reason particular scenario soon hacker got access user account credential started forward significant gmail significant email unknown gmail account couple scenario real finding real problem coronavirus work home really brought light one organization see ca compromise interesting see employee logging different part world especially right travel ban expect employee coming different part europe united state america within 5 10 minute call land speed violation previously folk probably would take plane different part world home computer still connected corporate network used throw people never got lot attention start looking analyzing data point one particular scenario saw employee logging many different part world simultaneously actually interesting security operation team folk actually investigate violation incident extra edge investigate especially travel ban like said start seeing several people logging different part world continues big challenge talked phishing campaign think see several phishing campaign one thing tell attacker keen direct monetization victim scenario actually attack instance use credential start phishing organization user employee contractor get much bigger plot plot much thicker directly attack pay ransom release computer back day behind u extent one particular scenario weaponized document actually run lot malicious process process connecting across different part kind interesting see phishing campaign turned last thing couple thing want touch cybersecurity space talk bad thing talk attacker hacker often associate malware group often associate hacktivist right see possible damage insider insider somebody part organization employee contractor damage could nine 10 time could unintentional problem still significant damage organization odds tell employee contractor associated critical project organization standpoint work material create often false sense belonging thinking document research work belongs employee contractor feel entitled take data go next job seek think okay take data nine 10 time deem insider cybersecurity space employee contractor typically intention unintentional time seen sort corporate espionage industry espionage see mostly brand unintentional reason bring especially right work home challenge see huge one organization first week march organization announced mandatory work home within 24 hour 48 hour security team organization relax cybersecurity control release cybersecurity control employee contractor home could keep connection vpn remote network connection bandwidth full every five minute connection kept dropping really started hurt business continuity inaudible really started hurt folk regular job security team decided going drop control folk little bit discretionary control sensitive document ended happening one employee start grant access personal account corporate share drive march 20th employee quits furthermore 25th march organization typically soon somebody quits disable access employee put backdoor account personal account starting continue login actually working competitor organization continues login start download sensitive data starting download peer colleague sensitive data backdoor entry go back challenge coronavirus work home phase going key finding want bring said couple key takeaway want definitely bring call right first thing talk traditional cybersecurity way business different right user laptop new perimeter used inside organization employee contractor outside working home think boundary know completely stretched new perimeter user laptop folk also using byod bring device using personal device connect corporate network first thing talk think traditional way monitoring need change need monitor user behavior monitoring whether phishing email whether hacker bad domain high number sensitive data downloaded common denominator employee contractor user common denominator amongst attack monitoring user workstation absolutely critical third thing tell go outside corporate organization big request folk listening call please update software application update application owner vendor providing reason take look note see security vulnerability patched strongly recommend everyone update zoom collaborative tool way zoom produced 101 best practice use personal id use lock room whatnot absolutely critical also let kid teacher know home schooling definitely something tracking closely business continuity perspective think emergency contact important one particular scenario employee distracted today take care kid take run home work sort secondary person emergency contact support especially infrastructure application whatnot think bcp plan place definitely key takeaway scenario also strongly recommend organization extend endpoint endpoint essentially small application run laptop detects suspicious activity detects suspicious malwares virus computer report back think lot vendor today providing including u providing sort specialized package help community recommendation make sure key monitoring place whether endpoint whether email need monitor even cloud solution think monitoring place collecting log absolutely key thing quickly touch one organization actual scammer impersonated one employee close getting lot sensitive data scammer also know fact workforce working home train service team member train customer service team member multiple layer challenge response absolutely make sure person calling end actually person claiming person sort multiple response framework absolutely required fall scammer last least confidential data still confidential today folk taking document reason justified bandwidth q anurag rana nanda santhana q anurag ranagetting clogged data loss whatnot whole pandemic gone inventory document gone think going big challenge organization post pandemic time question answer right great nanda thank much fairly comprehensive overview stuff seeing request listener question please put start addressing come nanda bunch thing mind stuff seeing research well first foremost byod question question audience talking core risk working home byod company issued asset company decides give laptop desktop reason threat level different give actual hardware asset would security cover lot risk start people working home laptop yeah think great question right key problem whether byod corporate asset folk sending challenge actually see folk working home lot different loophole tell organization soon step bring corporate asset home network seen organization employee actually connect call local cloud storage firewall rule organization enforce easy copy ton ton data personal storage device home whether byod corporate issued asset challenge existed even post think problem take u one thing bandwidth consumption also includes high degree victim respect phishing campaign right reason definitely see challenge employee contractor using byod device scenario corporate issued asset tell yesterday investigation one organization folk working home obviously kid home schooling happened whole zoom collaborative tool issue found organization started react said going allow zoom anymore employee started still need kid go home schooling still need multiple laptop two kid home schooling need multiple laptop organization also see user disabling security control corporate issued laptop actually adding pressure vulnerability scenario nanda santhana q anurag rananow make lot sense let talk little bit world post covid world looked security security product world one thing observed client deal whether large bank healthcare company retail company buy many security product sense seen embedded either public cloud offering unified solution take care lot thing ancillary question one big theme talked well last three four year hybrid infrastructure think change given happening yeah great question way cracking little bit know side anurag mean company essentially get company many different cybersecurity solution right post break thing cybersecurity perspective lot changed last 15 year used focused compliance function become much bigger program organization first foremost threat landscape changed right think much phishing campaign many different attack sophisticated attack reason attack evolved adversary today using sophisticated cloud infrastructure artificial intelligence ai enabled bot super advance one side threat actor threat landscape super advanced side like simpler time organization working something called firewall perimeter punched small hole send email send browse internet corporate network thing much changed landscape changed lot today opened cloud organization vendor connecting network given advancement usage cloud application side sophisticated threat actor threat technique constantly attacking top organization opened byod mean starting see last two year smishing phishing gone smishing sending malicious email sm state living see result old school technology focused compliance related scenario starting get displaced nextgen solution hence see may look like seeing multiple different vendor cybersecurity space essentially targeting specific function detecting specific technique think probably see anurag lot different cybersecurity solution market today perhaps explain mean understand larger company diﬃcult move critical application small sized company go aws microsoft move everything let worry many thing get heterogeneous infrastructure let worry spending nanda santhana q anurag rana nanda santhanasecurity help even company risk involved great question right think first company going stick one cloud solution provider let start right two reason want sort advantage want vendor advantage towards price cost main driver company first consider heterogeneous environment right big organization probably use top 3 cloud solution provider needle say next five six year starting see new trend private cloud right lot company really helping organization build private cloud come may way see next four five year data center going completely go away mean case would probably see legacy old school mainframe completely gone case critical financial transaction still happen mainframe heterogeneous cloud solution still prem data center matter call private cloud still fancy word expanding data center right think organization going face going heterogeneous environment multiple different cloud solution provider little bit data center presence mission critical one cloud solution provider provide security built going focused service going providing still need bigger mothership going get information hence strongly feel sticking one cloud solution provider end security solution provide going answer anurag long term well fair point one area touched today know got lot question privacy europe going make thing worse term access different application moving application without sort security could say scrutiny think need done come improving privacy across organization one vendor another share data yeah think cloud solution provider today keen sharing data right think privacy going big challenge organization one main driver also build private cloud worried data leaving organization exactly reason brought anurag privacy main driver trying trying see sort analytical work cloud point computation work cloud vendor really specialize want see data within data center privacy still big question mark q anurag rana nanda santhana q anurag rana nanda santhanathese evolution cloud happened last five six year thing surfacing lot regulatory requirement catching privacy angle right feel company going next year data may probably end staying trend within data center till strong regulatory requirement cloud solution provider able sort go certification process extremely cognizant towards privacy concern probably need meet think going sort like said hybrid solution speak great another area written lot talked managed security service company like ibm accenture large practice dedicated area take see uptake managed cloud managed security service next year still see much aggressive embracement product company yeah think trend perspective managed security solution provider definitely helping especially life science space manufacturing space reason simple right mean pharmaceutical company probably want focus especially time like want entire workforce work towards one goal want security team focusing 101 triaging cybersecurity incident side managed security service provider done fantastic job term providing repeatable process building team specialized automation work closely vendor cybersecurity space reason definitely see life science manufacturing even telecom place pivoting towards 101 operation cybersecurity operation go towards managed security service mdr stand manage direct response type company outsourced task house essentially security folk working business new term hear often frictionless security repurposing existing security professional within organization focus enabling frictionless security le worry security engineering worry building sort center excellence also develop relationship multiple vendor et cetera want manage sure see big rise managed security service provider definitely time like right good bring couple vertical sense seeing last month even past week industry vertical spending security product let say couple year ago industry came back q anurag rana nanda santhanayeah sure prior financial institution always first adopter post see space life science especially healthcare team forced invest lot tell quick interesting story one organization coo get email look like another peer hospital coo sending email actually fake email went coo first organization basically requested sort patient data sort cure whatever going name looked much similar actual coo second organization first coo email sensitive data right especially right challenge healthcare definitely seeing point trying make spend cybersecurity standpoint actually getting better getting better life science overall also starting see manufacturing company folk lot intellectual property folk really worried business continuity also spending lot money security product two vertical see rise outside traditional financial institution one thing talked lot year importance machine learning security oracle talk lot autonomous database one thing brought part suggestion recommendation people patch software latest upgrade whatever new patch put oracle talk lot database think end day need security need software product pretty much either patch provisioning human basically taken equation think bigger concern anurag actually patching one piece patched meaning unless first victim really hard organization developer developing software shift entire organization industry called making security left right meaning pushing security left essentially mean every developer develops application cognizant obviously 101 vulnerability exploit hacker exploit vulnerability working towards making sure address loophole oftentimes see whether latest magecart carbanak whatever attack family problem see developer much foresight figuring whatever developed actually potentially could used back door entry attacker come point trying make automation organization cloud service provider vendor solution focused patching vulnerability key challenge actually patching go vulnerability identifying called vulnerability meaning nobody else discovered challenge long challenge exists taking human taking cybersecurity professional going challenge know sure q anurag rana nanda santhana q anurag rana nanda santhana good last question particular aspect area term spending pattern see company across whoever client base term different vertical allocating money like legacy security product new security product seeing increase security product like current sense budget talk cio cisos yeah think could definitely see cisos chief information security oﬃcers able good play strong role board meeting able brief board one cybersecurity incident exactly bring company reputation perspective term profit organization going get perspective overall spend cybersecurity solution gone significantly last three four year definitely trend post think organization focused towards little bit careful spend really analyzing right really need 101 compliance strictly compliance focused solution need solution mean securonix standpoint done post whole scenario threat model call threat model essentially detect sophisticated threat thing completely changed everybody working home point trying make right setup completely different said think cybersecurity team really focused probably decommissioning legacy solution focused solution solving actual problem hand hear news medium whole covid work home could possibly wave thing going wave going expect see user employee contractor vendor continuing work home really think cybersecurity professional going make change really going spend tool really going stay stick within organization think making tough decision early anurag u definitive definitely think going analyze differently really careful spend nanda final word wrap think first thank webinar definitely want thank hero hope everybody safe home first outside digital world washing hand making sure continuing whatever cdc advising big thanks like said line hero also want thank bloomberg opportunity inviting q anurag rana nanda santhanasome threat seeing absolutely real securonix standpoint ready go package ready offer lot customer prospect would love take advantage thank anurag inviting session great thanks wrap replay session heard link sent webinar transcript live terminal case question reach nanda big thanks nanda one best storyteller know great concludes session thanks everybody thank
