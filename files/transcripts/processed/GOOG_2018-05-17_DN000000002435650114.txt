research practice iot ecosystem trend research practice idc umbrella program iot look market holistically really look understand iot ecosystem evolving also lot work looking iot platform space particular dive specific segment market today sort go overview happening industry term agenda today sort take look big picture iot 2018 put number around look worldwide iot opportunity also look iot vendor landscape macro perspective dive iot platform market specifically talked idea iot ecosystem reason need think ecosystem perspective fact complex set technology service required make happen think iot enterprise perspective think decision make right first think thing want connect thing could anything chipset module industrial asset consumer device consumer good refrigerator think kind connectivity need lot option well everything ranging cellular new low power wide area technology wifi satellite even fixed connectivity still much part iot implementation need think infrastructure going support implementation could include thing like gateway router piece equipment need think software component stock iot platform help u build manage application well managing device think going gain intelligence data analytics layer go also iot specific application oriented towards horizontal vertical use case think bring together see service provider playing important role ecosystem consulting perspective implementation perspective providing managed service support service really need kind glue help u tie solution together think security really considered holistically across entire stack really lot organization think looking deploy iot technology think key theme seeing 2018 find budget starting earmarked iot project often happening within scope broader digital transformation initiative survey every single year ask close 4,000 decision maker worldwide plan iot 2016 found 30 something percent organization budget place iot project survey 2017 percentage jumped close 70 huge spike one year really show organization starting take seriously also find market opportunity increasingly becoming driven therefore vendor sort narrowing strategy become focused various vertical industry various use case support need industry finding organization necessarily seeking iot technology case vertical even refer iot really looking iot technology support certain business call see cloud underlying enabling capability iot success going give u scale increasingly understand edge also taking additional significance talk edge capability compute closer source data generation analytics artificial intelligence really forefront discussion today go technology conference hear ai ai ai talk iot really important remember building block place start applying type advanced analytics data need right connectivity need able manage device getting reliable data make sure implementation secure holistic perspective also see increasing acknowledgement skill shortage holding back iot project today think driver inhibitor iot investment touched challenge survey every single year security come number one inhibitor iot project really increasing potential attack surface quite bit extend beyond traditional sort perimeter kind went traditional perimeter mobile device imagine iot perimeter really really increasing surface area multitude cost always second challenge project think iot project lot piece part go going lot service go well lot upfront cost think ongoing cost connectivity part right usually going something ongoing cost related connectivity well usual ongoing cost part kind project privacy concern definitely raised forefront iot think retail strategy put beacon track location store tracking perhaps demographic thing bring real privacy concern concern technology stability capability think getting point 2018 becoming stability around technology still talking emerging space significant concern finally talked lack skill challenge lack skill term embedded technology need lack skill term bring solution together lack skill analytics data science side really need bring solution market term driver meaningful driver place despite challenge organization planning move forward initiative opportunity improve business productivity think say manufacturing perspective could dynamic scheduling factory predictive quality automation within factory ability reduce cost think smart city example smart lighting system save lot energy cost thing smart building system moving eﬃciency customer important driver think supply chain improvement make supply chain impact customer downstream whole value chain internal maintenance cost talk manufacturing lot session today sort largest see today largest vertical area vertical spend many biggest use case come manufacturing think opportunity predictive maintenance machine therefore save cost maintenance finally improving customer experience think retail perspective yes little bit think something tracking u time able personalized experience offered u also also think new product offered iot data instead buy asset buy service asset look spending perspective believe iot spending grow 1.1 trillion 2021 growing rate 14.4 forecast period know sound like really big number think different technology going spending hardware component software component connectivity component service component well tracking think close 75 use case iot spending guide right obviously one piece puzzle going hundred use iot use case going pervasive think number really going significant move forecast period see lead spending north america coming second emea coming third speak regional trend next slide think iot spending touch sort mega trend driving spending across region top use case across region north america really mega trend digital transformation one main driver adopting iot within north america need reduce operational cost could something like headcount within organization fuel saving ﬂeet north america manufacturing transportation logistics two largest use case say vertical europe process automation really top driver iot spending today key trend really trend around industry europe manufacturing also top vertical term spending end forecast period also see consumer industry spending going make significant amount spend region improving internal eﬃciencies top driver iot project manufacturing number one vertical spending region followed utility transportation well trend pacific driving spending still initiative like made china 2025 certainly manufacturing space also fact kind rise middle class japan lot effort around connected society go region region see difference driving iot spending manufacturing kind constant term top vertical iot spending across world look iot vendor perspective discussed technology sack includes broad range technology surprise lot vendor participate space broken hardware software service standard body industry solution grouped way think way organization go building iot solution make lot decision lot different vendor choose think one key takeaway slide also want call attention iot platform component slide sort right middle think important point first take lot real estate space lot vendor participating point organization make iot platform decision vacuum right think hardware need connect platform need think analytics going leverage data collect platform think standard platform support think industry specific industry solution want adopt run platform going bring together get platform little bit couple minute wanted call attention particular slide think iot macro perspective one question ask survey mentioned type vendor think going likely lead iot earlier day fielding survey hardware vendor sort top list seen shift last couple year software analytics vendor risen top believe market maturity taking place right beginning market everybody really thinking potential thing connect going connect moving okay may handle piece hardware want connect connectivity need think well end goal insight want gather data attention focused software analytics component stock next question asked okay think instance software vendor going really kind thought leader space one really making lot money think going make money result asked different category person able sort give viewpoint category think couple important point take away slide first asking perception perception versus actually making money right think today example software analytics area google came number three google actually commercial offering key space well enterprise side anyway really really focused product 2017 perception point google could leader think certainly driven consumer side also focus around analytics everything done ai think another sort telling aspect also siemens ot side really began kind mature commercial iot offering market last year perception perspective ranked number one think interesting kind understand really interesting term like think mindshare market think job sort track revenue shake next year respective space slide also really reinforces idea iot ecosystem one vendor dominate space entirely okay going move discussion specifically around iot platform really see iot platform essential component iot stack following space may heard hundred think number get tossed around last 400 iot platform market idc quite look way bit narrow definition include iot platform space u classified iot platform within market sizing platform connectivity component device management component usually offering solid ph data ingestion processing management mechanism part connect device start getting data device need able ingest store processing piece come get stored need run analytic visualization tool usually part platform product well data wo able visualize kind four key component see making iot platform one product u consider iot platform iot visualization tool consider platform iot visualization tool sometimes product include application development tool sometimes include advanced analytics included pricing consider part platform term architecture talk bit minute really think platform support distributed computing talked idea cloud important cloud call core could centralized data center could cloud could data center centralized data center say mid factory ﬂoor manufacturing manufacturing example security sort run throughout stack see kind standalone security product would consider iot platform u iot platform security architected also think platform increasingly apis integrate business system lot time raw iot data meaningful combine point context make meaningful look iot platform vendor perspective crowded space interesting look map nicely first slide showed sort showed iot technology stack thing service got company vendor make thing fit iot platform could machine could chip set could cellular module got vendor build network equipment heavily involved space got vendor run connectivity network platform got analytics application cloud vendor participating service vendor well service vendor sometimes proprietary platform usually offer partner platform well focus really generating service revenue le allegiance one specific software platform finding right fit customer obviously lot competition think think necessarily strategy iot platform war think winner emerge category play together think nobody vendor landscape really positioned sort lead across area partner see evidence taking place ecosystem last couple year partnership across application development cloud edge connectivity management device management talk couple example bring life look application development aws obviously offer number web service really building block build solution salesforce brings customer contact situation customer might build underlying sort iot infrastructure software infrastructure say aws want bring point context application might leverage salesforce iot solution concert bring talked idea adding context iot data cloud space one thing seen organization really focused cloud infrastructure like google microsoft amazon certainly focused cloud strategy vendor cloud strategy le focused infrastructure piece trying give customer choice sap ge digital ptc example company really trying focus service layer partnering cloud infrastructure provider customer want run paas google iaa able instead run sap cloud edge infrastructure side got number organization provide gateway hardware think running application hardware instance ibm sdk run ibm iot watson application cisco gateway connectivity management space cisco piece talking cisco jasper cisco jasper integrated many mobile operator network around world ibm microsoft necessarily make whole lot sense try make effort well make sense customer want iot deployment cellular partner ericsson cisco jasper device management side lot partnership lot different provider device hardware know manage better company originally manufactured right bosch ibm good example ibm partnered bosch bosch device management software partnership across space think come sort see iot platform ecosystem within broader iot ecosystem key attribute winning platform player talk ecosystem partnership like ph believe point standard support really important lot different standard need understand standard important industry support really important focus use case see customer necessarily going saying want buy iot platform want piece technology support use case going important developer ecosystem anytime talk platform want developer think cloud momentum also important talked scale also lot developer interest pulled day big cloud provider strong developer ecosystem going enhance iot strategy analytics really important get value data think iot platform player need strong analytic strategy got get pricing right seen many iot platform player slashed pricing last year 50 pricing model high think data customer want run analytics store iot global nature talked earlier whether multinational organization manufacturer shipping product world going think global connectivity think global language support global tech support platform player really strong global capability okay finishing quick view future platform really think idea edge cloud edge core architecture really important increasingly cost send everything cloud security issue concern around latency bandwidth organization going want process data closer point generation platform provider need able support application wherever need run think trend around container serverless computing valuable platform container offer portability important talking heterogeneous endpoint environment serverless computing really allows u take approach iot save u cost spinning computing see certain event happen instead running time also think blockchain going interesting technology intersection iot certain use case like around supply chain track trace term functional enhancement think rapid application development tool added platform allow people organization participate development process idea digital twin augmented reality taking digital taking physical world making digital going really key trend especially industry iot integration device organization want million iot endpoint make process simpler talked contextual integration could customer data could weather could location data monetization tool start build new revenue model based data term consumption going go two way one hand depends depends buying platform technical sale need micro service available technical person kind buy piece part need hand line business sale happen lot iot need application think actually quite useful platform vendor able offer approach anurag rana stacy crookmarket see momentum market happening next year today contact information anybody question get answered within q session today feel free reach afterwards thank much stacy good overview request listener question please type read stacy stacy let talk little bit something learned cloud general look cloud architecture cloud could say one reason going cloud little secure would say far secure homogeneous architecture compared combination lot internal patched together year look iot space really mentioned one large mega provider going back construct service company patching together relationship product going come business model ﬂawed security would thing take might actually come pretty quickly think really astute observation think going see happen leading cloud provider going take initiative move space either going create really tight partnership leading technology provider think one example seen cloud provider moving cloud technology actually outside cloud right first thing seen taking cloud technology allowing customer run premise like azure take microsoft example azure stack good example iot moving even like continue microsoft azure iot edge kind taking bunch web service running even cloud smaller iot endpoint introduced recently fear something operating system microcontroller like end iot endpoint usually see cloud provider one taking initiative create part reason right create secure trade net chain trust end way end iot back cloud going complete piece computing say microsoft might like gateway think see company like talked example ibm cisco coming together create partnership around iot think happen service provider wo still play important role think anurag rana stacy crook anurag ranatechnology vendor going increasingly take upon create chain trust within solution extent also form really close alliance major technology provider needed fairly detailed discussion one thing also seen digging around topic last month edge computing service launched cloud provider fairly new mean think perhaps 2 year old concept helping adoption rate mentioned mean also hearing service company implementing project project size improving enterprise adoption going key reason see anything else driving adoption rate think part right think manufacturing majority iot spend within manufacturing space edge important industrial iot right lot organization going send talk going send certain piece information probably never going go cloud really important able adopt iot know keep information factory ﬂoor whatever private network need keep within actually think edge computing technology going make much realistic manufacturing oil gas think fact oilfield middle nowhere connectivity time different challenge driving think definitely one part think also digital transformation effort become mature iot really sit hand hand digital transformation effort see maturity happening think see also think analytics technology mature also really going help push iot forward one really key component two connectivity mean cellular connectivity expensive wifi fine talk somebody mobile use case think increasing prevalence lpwan network also help move forward think got number trend converging help start pushing iot forward thanks another one mind look vendor currently amongst top list general electric pop number industrial company mentioned siemens bosch least general electric stacy crook anurag rana stacy crookbeen talking many year seems like look like level traction would expected three year ago recently saw partner microsoft example use azure predix application trend see going forward well industrial company use tech company backbone would interesting selling higher value service cloud provider final winner case think see trend happening think ge mentioned ge digital moving direction bosch also moving direction running various component iot suite public cloud talked abb day really highly invested azure platform iot solution icg done moving towards iot solution application focus think company realized running infrastructure application core competency take lot resource effort think really trying focus core competency core competency knowing industry well understanding specific use case value trying get think going focus analytics application layer versus infrastructure moving forward got one interesting use case seen salesforce device connected crm system message sent people mobile device thing potentially breaking interesting concept look like device management side crm side vendor kind cooler stuff arena know mentioned google sure something like think think salesforce yes adding context piece company sort competing crm space going look similar look similar strategy right think think way oracle sap microsoft started think iot thinking even ge servicemax acquisition thinking make improve customer service field service organization create personalized experience customer staying hotel know every time come hotel like know order meal room service think something looked ibm one watch space ibm assistant recently launched iot think company participating ai space company strategy look see anurag rana stacy crook anurag ranathey combine iot ai create better personalization seems lot interesting thing going one final question blockchain mean something obviously news lot lot reason kind use case come iot kind guess solution/applications see emerging yeah think let say think kind three big place big application looking right plan write research soon sort detail think anything track trace component interesting use iot blockchain thing moving supply chain logistics could transmitting data could transmitting data blockchain blockchain verifying true product end wherever supposed go something go wrong product say food food reach end destination spoiled find exactly logistics process happened say plane sending back information verified blockchain refrigerator temperature x z time later process maybe see refrigerator temperature supposed also verified blockchain verifies give u better verification something may gone wrong process getting food someone think another interesting use case blockchain iot security think traditional security model something authenticating centralized authenticator iot might time make trip authentication service cloud might time make trip cloud back peer peer security model iot could interesting technical diﬃculty iot blockchain like distributed model another interesting use case could monetization use cryptocurrency way pay something within iot think blockchain iot coming together iot monetization use case certain organization like iota one really focused use case bringing iot blockchain together think iot chain maybe another organization look awesome stacy thank much informed session look forward talking next year get update strategy thank everyone stacy crook great thank
