good afternoon everyone welcome 2:45 session afternoon pleasure introducing nvidia today speaking nvidia rob csongor head investor relation rob go roughly 15 minute presentation time q afterwards rob kick okay thank much thanks thanks stephen like stephen mentioned going go couple slide give overview nvidia business driving growth also give update thing week week supercomputing 2013 couple interesting announcement touch recent news business okay please note safe harbor familiar nvidia visual computing specifically target segment market segment different place visual computing matter whether automobile whether movie seen movie gravity marveled special effect movie gravity done using nvidia sometimes people ask hey danger displaced integrated graphic one first thing always point well ca build movie special effect movie like gravity using integrated graphic example course across different segment really vertical segment focus thing like gaming pc gaming professional visualization design performance computing big data analytics touch new announcement made week supercomputing specifically market oem business oem business basically product manufactured company put gpu range anywhere notebook tablet phone automobile lot volume business sold pc market basically monetized technology form chip board historically come view technology company view chip company per se technology company moved new market like android market enterprise market expanded business model include licensing technology licensing well build completely integrated system build system server build completely integrated android game device also license technology addition processor board touching highlight recent quarter revenue 1.054 billion 8 previous quarter key fundamental think one thing people continue point think increasing awareness nvidia gpu business continues outperform pc market touch moving part within first foremost pc gaming driving gpu growth desktop notebook touch record quarter quadro business professional graphic workstation business also record quarter tesla compute business touch detail tegra significantly last quarter coming trough quarter q2 revenue doubled quarter quarter q2 q3 touch dynamic near record high gross margin 55.7 slightly previous quarter record high gross margin company slight dip gross margin due increase tegra revenue quarter quarter also going touch momentum three growth business excited one tegra android one tesla compute business one grid putting gpus data center streaming graphic touch thing going also q3 announced intent return 1 billion capital shareholder fiscal 2015 okay first item talked one fundamental question always get possible nvidia gpu business growing pc market decline answer start nvidia ever addressed bottom 70 market lot application email browsing kind thing using integrated graphic come inside notebook pc fine however focus vertical segment visual computing matter lot within segment develop lot technology also paid lot value deliver segment revenue compared gartner date revenue pc okay meaning q1 q3 look gartner pc market decline 11 overall nvidia gpu business 4 number within moving part underneath pc gaming 6 reï¬‚ects pretty much steady state growth seeing pc gaming quadro business 12 quite bit large part driven refresh quadro lot workstation customer went refresh year bring latest kepler based product nvidia graphic quadro workstation business also saw significant ramp one growth opportunity described tesla tesla revenue 43 lot lot people look declining market note declining pc unit nvidia immune see segment business declining mainstream oem notebook business mainstream oem business business characterized reasonably high unit low asp low gross margin lowest asp lowest gross margin business net effect hopefully take away get nvidia business primarily driven vertical segment word 20 volume drive roughly 70 80 gross profit end result decline pc market decline mainstream oem business likely offset increase gpu business growth segment make sense first one segment talked pc gaming quarter introduced new product geforce gtx 780 ti one thing important pc gaming performance crown include review review 780 ti clearly put nvidia back pedestal term performance crown important pc gaming market one surprise u emergence gaming notebook gaming notebook even though overall notebook market declining gaming notebook revenue nvidia gpu business doubled last two year pretty significant component notebook business essentially thin light notebook geforce gpu operates zero power using time day use integrated graphic launch game point switch geforce gtx gpu get best world get notebook long battery life also play call duty ghost segment pc sku currently serve aside pc gaming mentioned earlier record revenue quarter tesla accelerated computing growing fast business take gpu gpu used compute used address application highly parallel nature market research data intersect360 seeing 2x growth one year hpc system accelerator system nvidia market share roughly 85 4 market going intel xeon phi variety solution including custom believe tremendous opportunity u right clearly area invested familiar u investing compute cuda number year seeing steady run rate business based application within design world running tesla opposed lumpy revenue saw last year based single large supercomputer example mentioned going touch news week supercomputing 2013 highlight week launched tesla k40 world fastest accelerator supercomputing big data analytics big data analytics involves massive computation involving sorting comparing large amount data highlighted example nvidia tesla gpu used example shazam week supercomputing showcasing tesla gpu used twitter big data analytics believe segment market big opportunity announced week ibm nvidia partnering build generation supercomputer probably exciting developing accelerated version enterprise software application nvidia cuda gpu complete suite enterprise software imagine think roughly 20 billion software enterprise business ibm application going accelerated using nvidia gpu exciting u think know path revenue nvidia start technology requires software application take advantage technology basically great early indicator nvidia tesla gpu also announced power europe number one supercomputer launched cuda 6 one thing working come way facilitate programming making easier parallel programming cuda 6 unified memory big step forward achieving growth opportunity excited know lot people street also product called grid grid take graphic take gpu put data center stream interactively across internet three segment targeting first engagement enterprise second within design world stream autodesk adobe apps small designer third area gaming first engagement earliest path revenue enterprise side done worked together company like citrix vmware accelerating hypervisor component code within product gpu accelerate virtual desktop end result trial 200 company large company variety different industry finance aerospace variety different application finance product lifecycle management plm end result every order make happen make revenue happen ecosystem engage start citrix vmware also includes major server oems point think every major server oem hp dell citrix cisco rather japan fujitsu hitachi europe point grid server product addition need application take advantage think within finance world usually whenever try articulate benefit accelerating virtual desktop financial world usually first nod head say need go get use virtualized desktop today even moving data performance slow sometimes imagine accelerated version imagine accelerate move medium rich asset text data move picture video right key big area u point trial revenue already starting grow u big question grid really time revenue good news exciting part take go trial large company asked q3 earnings call addition tesla grid big growth driver company number one biggest growth driver u point tegra think right single business unit nvidia tegra roadmap tegra essentially taking gpu look nvidia business visual computing gpu sell matched x86 go pc server done take gpu put system chip market android world strategy tegra gpu business within gpu business target 100 pc market mentioned earlier 70 pc market need nvidia gpu target pc visual computing matter strategy tegra exactly target segment android market visual computing matter address majority market matter lot market great example saw proof point quarter think familiar company called xiaomi hot phone company china xiaomi goal launching smartphone would get press review china said faster iphone faster galaxy s4 would record fastest benchmark smartphone world going take phone target chinese android gaming market largest android gaming market world order use qualcomm use mediatek used nvidia perfect example android device visual computing mattered achieved exactly set every benchmark review outperformed iphone outperformed samsung galaxy s4 targeted market android china gaming market china sold first production lot 86 second next production lot another couple minute popular phone point opportunity perfect example tegra strategy strategy goal become phone supplier entire world focus phone visual computing matter look device also example transformer new transformer asus 2500 1600 resolution screen absolutely beautiful tegra device new stylus device toshiba tegra note 7 device released pc hp released series device based tegra variety device coming thing say word android think lot people automatically come back think well mean phone today phone market mature segment android market know android revolutionizing lot different market phone whether box display clamshell pc automobile variety new device coming believe segment market visual computing matter basically strategy year know component year late tegra 4 coming year going late tegra think already people know tegra already showed recently gave sneak preview editor day montreal recently looking forward growth point believe tegra q4 believe next year focus right focus visual computing segment market driving outperformance pc market driving gross margin sometimes asked question asp margin compete integrated graphic look size gpu gamers use mean huge board like board going replaced integrated graphic solution fact gaming side sell 1,000 within professional world sell many thousand dollar end result steadily increasing gross margin line dipped slightly last quarter primarily due growth tegra basically tegra revenue came back q3 dipped slightly mentioned increased capital return shareholder think pretty straightforward think checked result reasonably straightforward increased quarterly dividend 0.75 sorry 0.075 0.085 per quarter announced intent return 1 billion capital fy15 increased share repurchase authorization end fy16 think good think response good think reï¬‚ects continue generate cash point believe enough cash purpose war chest given amount cash amount generating fair amount confidence continue generate cash even probably pretty poor market last year able okay let see summary get q summarizing think growth driver gpus outperforming pc market key point grid lifting runway think starting generate revenue hopefully visibility time revenue grid another key component u tegra revenue ramping back tegra 4 shipping 15 device android mentioned phone going drive growth another record automotive quarter talk much automotive automotive continues ramp steadily u q stephen chin rob csongor q stephen chin rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participantautomotive tegra automotive right largest revenue backlog nvidia bad news automotive take long time get good news give purchase order extends number year give u lot visibility tegra automotive revenue project logan customer project logan brings kepler gpu mobile market android market excited okay question answer great thanks rob sure ample time question want see anything audience first yes sir first rob would mind quantify little bit size backlog automotive currently backlog automotive disclosed previously close 2 billion revenue extends obviously quite number year customer concentration issue meaning sorry mean disproportionately revenue getting right automotive disproportionately skewed toward particular oem rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor well revenue receive obviously production vehicle right think look production vehicle include audi bmw volkswagen company like pretty spread yes obviously lot design win ca talk yet like mentioned time market take number design win ca talk allowed aggregate speaking design win give u sense nvidia stand today design win momentum versus conversation year ago design win momentum increased reason really three movement occurring within automotive one provide better visuals fundamental thing like navigation idea look tesla example tesla two tegra beautiful basically google earth complete topographical smooth seamless streaming get used level direction hard go back one kind chunk slowly hard go back one component really two new segment starting see talk announced going see tegra used rendering instrument panel physical gauge disappearing replaced rendered panel able convey lot information safer third area advanced driver system q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant q stephen chinso case using gpu inside tegra thing like computer vision pedestrian detection collision avoidance thing like object blow front car quickly identify child paper bag depending answer may brake may answer different rob apologize clear question design win momentum versus year ago much confined automotive corporate whole whole wow well would say would break hard say mean go ahead yes mean within pc gaming market think much design win business right growing business driven number gamers game come massively multiplayer game drive business anything much design win would say probably professional side obviously growth business much driven design win example within tegra business obviously much design win business within oem business design win oriented saw big increase number design win tegra year know always tell whole picture revenue design win matter lot whole bunch small one look especially businesslike example tesla design win supercomputer result lumpy big growth revenue would kind fall time look enough design win momentum start running steady state revenue think right would characterize tesla grid tegra driven design win buildup run rate business thanks rob maybe couple sorry q unidentified participant rob csongor q stephen chin rob csongor q stephen chin rob csongorwhat business model something like shazam situation mean selling chip get kind penny every time use something yes would great every time question business model shazam business model shazam sell big large tesla gpu go inside data center oem sale compensated per hit shazam would kind cool maybe next time yes rob maybe drill little grid well first technical spec end thing like general sort assumption provide large grid deployment might x number rack track 20 tesla example vary depending end market vertical targeting yes actually dependent exactly specific application way end happening certain number instance per gpu need support depending application going change going move back forth one question devil detail actual user experience standpoint talk little bit implication grid purely faster response time service provider actually easier usage model associated application service mean tesla grid basically faster xeon data center actually new usage model simple video stream opposed log multiple service software client order get service multiple speaker great question promise virtual desktop promise vdi company care centralized data example guy right financial world centralized data necessarily want put data locally onto client everywhere lost stolen whatever want virtualized desktop tablet notebook something like want able access q stephen chin rob csongor q stephen chinso fact financial world us vdi use citrix use vmware bloomberg factset guy use citrix use virtual desktop client case financial world actually even expect financial world would one early adopter grid data turn used vdi performance slow even vdi sorry even data imagine approached company aerospace company said addition data need move around asset like cad model video large diagram picture mean look asset used product lifecycle management design airplane anything like imagine lot asset would want use simply need better performance order virtual desktop practically useful answer question one segment user using acceleration vdi mean save money elsewhere within financial world mean could need desktop client could use lower powered one work fine case rich medium asset simply possible citrix vmware enthusiastically promoting grid open opportunity never term ease pain adoption grid similar sort cuda 1 2 steep learning curve grid different time around certainly collect get ecosystem get server folk board application certified order cuda tesla tesla world rewrite application almost per app basis within enterprise vdi world already citrix vmware microsoft kvm lot company simply accelerating application word added attraction rip keep add gpu accelerated believe time revenue term rewriting apps everything simply trial show large aerospace company show demo next day give purchase order take go trial go testing kind stuff okay two question tegra first automotive market basically sort infotainment driver assistant aid system targeted tegra certain price range luxury car rob csongor q stephen chin rob csongor q stephen chin rob csongor q stephen chininclude mainstream know ti talking good game also omap infotainment driver assisted aid system yes good question think historically lot feature capability started higher end car kind like car nav car nav started higher end car time came mainstream think think new one lot type technology believe going become fundamental kind like used anomaly used point interest whenever saw car car nav today even think twice anymore get car move rapidly given selective mobile inaudible mobile side thing business going mean term nvidia asp gross margin profile product relative everybody else going everything well product corporate gross margin product within tesla grid growth opportunity well corporate average look notebook business well corporate gross margin tegra side tegra business actually becoming hard say exactly one piece tegra kind varies overall tegra corporate gross margin device like automotive little higher device like shield lower building shield case gross margin much lower gross margin dollar obviously larger sorry maybe rephrase question tegra particular wherever tegra competing another product peer would say tegra able garner premium relative peer line oh yes absolutely guarantee mediatek priced better nvidia example nvidia never price competitive supplier structured obviously get integrated graphic free whatever provide sell gpu pc obviously premium market serve premium potentially thousand dollar rob csongor q stephen chin rob csongor q stephen chin rob csongor q stephen chin q unidentified participantthen couple last question tegra tegra 4i integrated modem think year ago jensen still talking progressing importance modem current message focusing visual computing much visual computing market far mobile low power device go much requires broadband connectivity cellular connectivity well believe going large segment android device coming require data modem report recently stated 2017 example almost every car connected via lte connected connected continuously believe investment made modem lte modem automotive variety different android device important one device android market requires voice modem phone phone side view per strategy strategy tegra focus device visual computing matter xiaomi phone example believe opportunity phone still segment phone market care visual computing xiaomi example think quarter think announced earnings disclosed got certification pleased think satisfying definitely skeptic satisfying done full certification voice data voice data yes quickly think get certification geography service provider ntt vodafone think mean biggie done certification others disclosed yet okay rob csongorrob mind confusion licensing agreement intel could articulate exactly agreement people think think 2017 going hit waterfall others said aspect technology go perpetuity extent intel desire continue integrate graphic going owe nvidia type money going renegotiation true point would tend happen 2015 story 2016 speak part business sure reasonably straightforward public go read detail roughly roughly halfway almost halfway licensing deal patent licensing agreement intel go q4 fy17 point expires perpetual license go way applies u applies second licensing deal done intel first licensing deal 2004 received perpetual license graphic received access front side bus result build chipsets value derived 4.5 billion revenue chipsets think guy familiar disagreement term agreement ended suing intel end result announced new agreement one go 2011 2017 value derived agreement 1.5 billion cash 2017 question going happen know lot thing happen think investor perspective question simply conceivable replace 266 million profit concern 100 certain disappears 100 certain replaceable lose half nvidia loses half profit think somewhere 100 sure 100 sure wo probably reality lot iron fire intent drive profit grow count across license agreement work way may want right generating patent rate 500 1,000 year may want license agreement see meantime announced number initiative would say certainly seeing enough early indicator thing drive profit nvidia beyond today grid tesla ip patent licensing ip core licensing number thing number iron fire see see q stephen chin rob csongor actually time rob maybe take question appreciate time today thanks update okay pleasure thank much
