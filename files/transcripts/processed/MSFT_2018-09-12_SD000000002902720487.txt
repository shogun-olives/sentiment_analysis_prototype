cetera feel great market chosen amongst highest grower overall market called gdp whatever spend bucket want put secondly feel quite good execution within product portfolio competitive positioning execution market think u important thing set great example focusing q karl emil keirstead amy e. hood q karl emil keirsteadthings control tends think manage inside company got okay make sense maybe zero part microsoft story azure might le 10 revenue probably least half inbounds get start couple interesting dynamic happening within broadly azure bucket saas em business certain growth rate got based core azure certain growth rate get blend talk little bit relative growth rate 2 piece shifting last year next year sure think maybe best point talk dynamic sit underneath em business really field organization customer azure em business would feel much like part oï¬ƒce microsoft 365 sold way sold per user basis thing sold per user tend different dynamic seeing simply dynamic amazing growth story u em business probably one largest franchise built certainly u offer tremendous value customer always sits believe sustainable business customer value em certainly offer dynamic ultimately look far like think oï¬ƒce right margin sold per seat installed base growth arpu growth opportunity add new feature use kind lingo e3 e5 could apply language product excited big surprised excited value offer good execution dynamic look different gross margin structure business quite high `` rest azure lot thing always talked exciting represents one largest tam expansion opportunity think ever existed see continuing large expansive every time spend time thinking large feel like larger applicability number excitement around development often utility across every industry across every country high business think little different right tam set user tam set workload mean bit multiplying factor workload changed disrupted transformed guess word like use business increasingly large base growth rate mitigates growth rate seen remained quite healthy even base gotten larger larger got amy think trying model azure u trying one thing look increasingly felt like azure early day model lot large enterprise become azure customer make large upfront commitment lot commitment amy e. hood q karl emil keirstead amy e. hooddo sit intelligent cloud revenue piece sit balance sheet unearned revenue backlog certainly tricky know much backlog unearned revenue increase attributable azure tricky try waterfall subsequent azure revenue maybe could comment sort much balance sheet uptick due azure commitment guidepost offer translate subsequent azure revenue tricky tricky per se different dynamic go back conversation em coming balance sheet onto p l look like oï¬ƒce dynamic right mechanism like subscription azure general recognized used pacing utilization balance sheet p l absolutely different rate simplifying fact sure ratable fine people know signing big commitment mean nothing p l get used mind think said way hit p l quite similar right move get used think maybe different leap think may make sound tone question talk importance driving utilization consumption much motion field focused customer success customer success thing make ï¬‚ywheel work business like azure project picked well value customer derives value meter spin revenue come p l without without customer success without customer value without focus customer deployment project picking wo right dynamic spend much time investing sale force whether technical capability direct interaction customer project project success increasingly everything putting people ground making sure customer support thing drive customer outcome direct way leader make sure thing come balance sheet p l business make sure process easy smooth customer could possibly opposed thinking accounting construct yes got okay make sense maybe amy moving little azure broader `` server product business another big success story microsoft giant business sql server window server suppose couple year ago many would argued business slowly decelerate workload transition successfully public cloud model yet actually growth hung remarkably well put terrific quarter think variable business fiscal give confidence maybe big enterprise server product business hang something close call low growth rate put q karl emil keirstead amy e. hood q karl emil keirsteadin general people really want decomponentize kpi would prefer server kpi talk lot server product service kpi really mechanism see success hybrid architecture sold customer one match sale motion value prop customer ... azure plus business prop azure plus component reason important think collectively talk dynamic sit underneath prem number specifically sale motion customer increasingly want want understand best utilize whether cloud value architecture built technical diï¬ƒculty feel like focused hybrid five year ago started talking think market moved increasingly talk value hybrid architected way beginning real customer value choice timing seen value customer whether purchase sql server license whether ultimately use sql server license hybrid azure hybrid benefit azure data service pool great outcome mostly great outcome customer given choice value accounting construct land one place really happy follow 100 compliant way message first kpi say `` people making commitment vision compute storage data whether buy one licensing mechanism azure commit probably focused maybe individual model builder would said dynamic impacting number 2 one hybrid benefit talked add ï¬‚exibility price benefit deep value customer allows ï¬‚exibility using license right cloud small price premium massive price advantage customer utilize right take workload cloud secondly premium mix continued see increasing premium mix obviously come arpu increase recent release value continued see consistent driver would say number time newer driver would hybrid benefit available technical diï¬ƒculty okay also love ask core oï¬ƒce business microsoft obviously another big success story think many people year ago given size maturity business would thought commercial oï¬ƒce growth rate could 10 staying level congratulation think spent part career microsoft unit amy amy e. hood q karl emil keirstead amy e. hood yes spent long time microsoft almost every unit ã¢â‚¬â€œ many year okay yes well amazing success wanted ask sustainability getting obviously deeper 365 shift deeper e1 e3 shift look growth driver oï¬ƒce business fiscal couple would encourage u focus attention well sure per se logic value offer customer tended sell particular business suite investment made past couple year meant make suite work terrific across multiple endpoint multiple operating system many people mind would show investment mobile application well mobile application ability work across io android device people use addition window experience also invested new workload new value always plan would say oï¬ƒce 365 maybe broadly microsoft 365 value added past year generally manageability security communication thing like team collaboration tool technical diï¬ƒculty value also add analytics think progress specifically made power bi past year probably best year business long time look say `` wow playbook new one u look say add value suite come mean far people word excel powerpoint represents many tool use every day get job done whether onedrive really terrific year specifically onedrive business whether team momentum seeing especially launched viral motion well team whether power bi start define redefine oï¬ƒce broad suite tool could see concept saying `` wow installed base could grow and/or could charge per seat add value provide good value price continue believe added lot feature provide great value say `` well amy guess adding really arpu story installed base story installed base story really growth small business make ton sense ability access type tool modern consistent resource seems relatively obvious still lot runway business global basis feel quite good place excited call worker scenario allows u even grow installed base inside enterprise seen u talk possibility hololens scenario think hololens many extension another endpoint oï¬ƒce reach new user new experience also also really good opportunity u q karl emil keirstead amy e. hood q karl emil keirstead amy e. hoodespecially emerging market product like kaizala tend think mobile product emerging market u another way add installed base amy listed number feature like power bi onedrive team security force picking favorite 1 2 perhaps others excited coming fiscal year next think way business big want 1 favorite many way go different opportunity opportunity team go opportunity power bi go value bring suite stickier know lower know churn workload get deployed real focus u better higher value technical diï¬ƒculty customer endpoint really matter okay maybe amy ï¬‚ip gaming right spotlight go e3 talk phil jacked future gaming maybe could talk little bit think number dynamic going need careful model sector microsoft coming super robust fiscal

invest take capture opportunity revenue want focus customer success want see land customer satisfaction want u continue focus gross margin improvement business want u stay focused lose passion around making sure every dollar spend spent highest roi see possible sure mindset wildly different actually might describe pretty consistent okay helpful maybe time one question getting little bit lately around capital allocation amy mind sharing u current view around use cash apart obvious restart buyback post github think know framework would encourage u think around capital allocation day consistent point view capital return meaningful component total shareholder return believed long time especially past year focused using buyback dividend tool one tool first might imagine mostly daily existence focus investing capital organic growth continuing look inorganic opportunity whether small size seen u use well tool feel good return gotten especially larger acquisition made inorganically use cash see difference continued view think remains important component satya well management technical diï¬ƒculty board focus think q karl emil keirstead amy e. hood q karl emil keirstead amy e.
