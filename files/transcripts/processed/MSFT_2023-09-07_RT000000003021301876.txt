excited charles first thanks making trip surviving humidity heat new york could start share background know microsoft couple different time history microsoft role responsibility current role absolutely first thanks super excited conversation today microsoft two time right university short stint company founder something called metricshub acquired microsoft little 10 year ago company focused public cloud cost management health monitoring let say early day iaa paas worked azure five year integrating working thing business application microsoft last five half six year dynamic 365 power platform kind across journey seen pretty broad shift business look like microsoft think exciting way despite say still think developer heart started career least recovering developer question answer question answer charles lamannaright recovering yes dynamic 365 obviously broad encompassing business right pocket crm even erp hr could talk little bit strategy dynamic 365 evolved time see

historically great platform enable improve solve issue like azure use oﬃce right business application make possible u shelf fast time value solution area business application able find lot success last five year really going three think main change think strategy first complete move cloud really meaningfully five six year ago dynamic dynamic 365 100 saas 100 hosted public cloud dynamic revenue 5 billion last fiscal year u 80 cloud big shift happened investment really modernizing meaningful way like talk thing like generative ai agility seeing dynamic born cloud migration kind one big change second thing business application historically big focus big monolithic investment like full crm full erp full scm different acronym mean high cost adoption enterprise frequently looking one system whole company ever want switch thing huge budgetary hit way service software done taken dynamic decomposed individual module customer easily adopt departmental workﬂow level replace whole crm use contact center one business move entire supply chain u move say part warehouse management type thing modularization allowed u really break established market without huge service cost mean last thing product perspective thing exciting u really got comfortable idea part microsoft microsoft business application company like cloud infrastructure company lot different capability one roof got comfortable making dynamic 365 integrate broader microsoft ecosystem use oﬃce q tyler radke charles lamanna q tyler radke charles lamanna q tyler radkelike team excel best way connect business application use dynamic 365 similarly want go manage data warehousing analytics ai azure dynamic 365 best easiest way go really kind integrated single microsoft platform something customer hungry continue hungry data silo kind walled garden type thing really three thing say like big change last year really accelerated business okay okay yes talked big change one question get lot investor look dynamic 365 growth actually accelerated meanwhile competitor certainly crm space seen growth slow would mainly attribute internal investment made platform maybe talk impacting ability compete take share kind respective category yes mean say kind laid foundation sure kind growth seen mean last year lot generative ai momentum think also played major part think getting cloud public cloud agility update feature release super differentiated compared lot business application vendor kind go look modularization found way get business talking replace whole crm replace whole erp instead let start department start function prove earn right get department function yes yes okay kind consistent across crm marketing whatever kind application absolutely yes think probably shape little bit different say crm erp side like crm much ownership process within department line business customer service say consumer business bank whereas erp sometimes like call like architecture erp headquarters edge say running warehouse manufacturing plant may use dynamic post back hq slightly different shape idea charles lamanna q tyler radke charles lamannayes talking generative ai think hard conversation microsoft without bringing summer saw pretty interesting demo announcement around crm copilot know talking lot event fall look forward kind see guess investor look forward fall term generative ai capability specific dynamic feedback customer since launch yes mean biggest thing think past point mean still going announcement past point say announcement demo press release immense amount generative ai product market generally available dynamic shipped first powered feature even back early 2021 market incredible customer story incredible adoption example think lot conversation around dynamic showing people done product like one example blog post published morning talking adopted copilot crm microsoft benefit seen one world complex customer support organization ten thousand people hugely diverse product window xbox azure use copilot 100 day rolling able see 12 improvement department productivity basically long take work customer support case level productivity benefit measurement economist statistically significant testing type thing really seen area 30 year since original digitization personal computer kind early inning seeing customer adopt see customer story coming think lot look forward product perspective early inning generative ai lot exciting stuff coming yes yes think dynamic business obviously ton different customer could talk demand trend seeing mean serving smbs dynamic think increasingly enterprise maybe departmental enterprise would kind compare contrast seeing demand front given macro environment yes mean one thing seeing price sensitivity hear customer go evaluate crm erp getting value expect price paying go look market already high per user price getting even higher lot case also thing like ai additional charge top customer discerning make sure getting return expect product many customer q tyler radke charles lamanna q tyler radke charles lamanna q tyler radkeconversations start going cost value going get productivity perspective end pretty different say environment past maybe course need crm going get crm course need erp cloud going get erp cloud good news encouraged inﬂuenced decision done thing like increased price dynamic 365 cloud think high price already reasonable fair price also gone ahead included copilot capability dynamic existing enterprise license main license customer buy like e3 exactly yes like get dynamic 365 enterprise standard sku come sale copilot customer service copilot finance copilot combination largely inﬂuenced kind conversation customer allowed u really nail roi think entire time business application microsoft never seen environment like right appetite switching crm erp level reason go back value get per dollar spend yes yes interesting guess sale perspective know product root development kind sale incentive structured microsoft organization obviously one biggest planet dynamic crm getting quota retirement incentivizing dynamic business way really drive even yes mean like mainline sale organization microsoft strongly incentive drive business application dynamic 365 power platform mainline investment u also specialized sale resource globally focused dynamic 365 power platform think like maybe huge change past year priority across sale organization yes take step back think tam microsoft application mean touching lot different front oﬃce back oﬃce mid oﬃce call well probably hundred billion dollar kind think addressability microsoft portfolio capture tam generative ai kind accelerate even increase tam charles lamanna q tyler radke charles lamannaso look business application historically thought tam ballpark 150 billion per year substantial tam mean span lot different category crm erp new cdp hcm even increasingly blurring like service management like itsm kind big opportunity also include low code rpa kind view one business application start offering help customer transform business process 150 billion within kind think dynamic 365 power platform key growth engine u like hopefully talk little bit power platform think area really lot upside u particularly generative ai look 150 billion encouraged microsoft opportunity inside extremely fragmented right different lot big software market category participate fragmented across 150 billion really mean kind one run away also encouraged high margin business something always mean scale high margin great also think going pretty profound transformation many different front mean first one seeing big change buyer really focused roi different taken fact go upgrade crm erp every year also customer looking new value proposition around productivity generative ai great productivity boost kind market changing lot got high fragmentation high opportunity high margin lot disruption think microsoft exceptionally well positioned lead disruption existing market largely generative ai integrating broader estate type thing yes think big getting bigger generative ai increase technology spent yes great well great segue want move power platform know excited maybe great kind define like different product power platform know power used lot different microsoft project kind evolved certainly fabric announcement build may kind thinking next evolution considering kind new vision integrating data analytics power platform yes folk may familiar power platform power bi service analytics reporting power apps web mobile application development power automate workﬂow robotic process automation power page website development power virtual agent chatbots conversational agent whole bunch different capability united q tyler radke charles lamannafact call basically mean historically drag drop visual authoring environment opposed drop write code like javascript java python benefit developer professional lot productive great study 6x 7x productive solution build using also start empower business user also create solution someone finance department use power bi analyze last quarter without go someone hr department create web application people use hr task without go turn around get go say supply chain core operation use power automate automate task idea full company creation full company development really critical make customer basically build solution need seen last decade pretty much insatiable desire create digital solution every single enterprise everywhere think find cio ever say enough resource enough developer build solution want power platform start make attainable kind power platform shared 33 million monthly active user growing 50 really massive user base something think going grow shared past like business measured billion dollar well cloud power platform concept coined early 2019 young product u go look kind space go future think large market opportunity think increasingly lot development done lot digital transformation done kind though product portfolio going reimagined generative ai probably power platform really start make even simple even straightforward create solution yes kind three pillar guess power platform got power bi data analytics got development tool kind automation rpa guess seeing guess momentum customer kind think fabric category kind get innovates fastest fabric announcement yes yes think exactly right like probably biggest three category three think look power bi power apps power automate think market leader three area adoption usage kind lot great study reﬂecting well probably three big category look fabric fabric kind reﬂects hear customer ask u constantly put thing power platform take historically data concept make accessible example expose q tyler radke charles lamannagpt model power platform expose complex say like operation around analytics inside power platform far fabric kind next evolution idea take power bi great reporting analytics expand encompass thing like data warehousing data storage data movement make easier developer work business user create solution like fabric kind natural progression would say probably expect u keep expansion power platform customer come push u ca grow dev team ca grow budget want grow output power platform faster easier yes one big driver oﬃce 365 broadly frontline worker opportunity kind think addressability power platform maybe hit dynamic context frontline worker opportunity microsoft lot success yes mean like one thing interesting like frontline worker historically underserved market come digital technology lot apps built go look app dev budget kind go back oﬃce development development frontline worker development kind always end playing like third fiddle really focused power apps making easy create mobile application frontline worker really stand apart pc wheel around computer say work retail location manufacturing plant inside say like hospital mobile application development easy power apps amazing story company like walgreens boot retail location great example like ikea retail location even say manufacturing plant scenario gsk like example frontline application historically pen paper data entry call someone become true standardized mobile application kind seen renaissance development focused frontline worker using power apps thing customer build also ship box dynamic 365 field service much focused frontline worker help work order track task mixed reality capability seen field service together back oﬃce say scheduling management workforce really strong combination customer kind power apps plus field service start cover lot scenario historically digital support q tyler radke charles lamanna q tyler radke yes certainly seems like big opportunity kind one maybe microsoft uniquely positioned go got 18 minute left know packed room question feel free raise hand sure could keep going longer 18 minute one thing want hit given background worked azure business referenced cost optimization kind original product built kind perspective know focused kind perspective talking lot customer term cloud optimization tail end anything hearing given focus historically yes mean like large azure customer even internally like always go constant optimization mean thing would say like optimization probably something always exist public cloud mean always existed think big question swing towards digital solution le optimization time one thing seeing hearing consistently customer generative ai know like everything generative ai really changing conversation past go reduce vms reduce data warehouse type thing much bring workload ai enabled transform function responsibility company ai enabled reason customer shift side large productivity benefit mean 10 productivity boost mean something ever get really single technology implementation single project lot opportunity like across board thing true software company build azure trying integrate generative ai application like every microsoft product definitely copilot today customer want copilot like experience well changed conversation definitely kind one key aspect maybe kind thought would like generally great public cloud fact optimization like buy server got wait three four year depreciate actually turn server book saving promise making public cloud 10 year customer benefiting think come help drive workload cloud people seen opportunity actually kind dial needed yes hit interesting point around roi productivity gain obviously copilot certainly talked customer using copilot hear great feedback obviously one want pay charles lamanna q tyler radke charles lamannaarea like knowledge worker certainly user appreciate productivity give seeing customer measure justify roi term hour happiness organization talk like hard measuring tool using justify investment copilot yes would say definitely climate think employee happiness maybe main motivator like going depend department think one great benefit like different business application really understand productivity look like seller mean revenue per head right fast close deal revenue generated per seller productivity look like customer support many case work per day cost per case every go basically company know two metric able say rollout copilot measure something like mentioned microsoft done clearly look say okay kind composition workforce change term expertise copilot really augment new hire thing like also really boost productivity closing case per day kind one example go like finance supply chain many finance employee per dollar revenue generate supply chain much inventory keep long take fulfill order often deliver full time business metric think go cfo cro cio know like copilot move needle kind maybe little bit pessimistic say like historically hard show benefit copilot hard customer work roll thing metric improve think talk new buying environment wanting roi productivity benefit going see customer adopt crm show rpa revenue per head per seller adopt case management tool show case resolved per day kind shift much across board okay okay helpful color cfo talked ai one microsoft fastest growing fastest growing business 10 billion think contribution dynamic power platform 10 billion target yes think first thing like could tell bullish ai mean microsoft think go look like hear customer appetite immense look business application specifically think like overweighted contribution compared say historical cloud revenue microsoft exactly look like lot q tyler radke charles lamannathings moving right hard say really seeing happen three thing business application first like mentioned earlier put copilot dynamic 365 existing application additional fee benefit sell bread butter like lot share gain many year row outgrown market think really help u accelerate core offering win deal sell deal competitive already seeing kind core product go faster second make sense ai oriented part dynamic 365 power platform example power apps something called ai builder use ai model application get certain amount credit want lot ai buy ai support gpt draw lot ai capacity seeing rapid adoption around ai builder example inside power apps see attachment make sense third thing entirely new product microsoft sale copilot generally available product crm fact work crm make seller productive wherever work whether outlook whether team whether window whether go sale copilot make productive ai assistant help better conversation prepare meeting better understand account better type thing new application think huge opportunity u net new revenue line also entirely greenfield market go company sale copilot today like crm kind constant connect microsoft crm type thing think three drive lot revenue biz apps near term like next 12 month primarily going core bread butter product selling go three year going increasingly ai first product like github copilot great example right right hit kind greenfield opportunity maybe sale copilot could talk little bit kind big opportunity could yes like microsoft sale copilot charge 40 per user per month connect 365 crm included 95 per user per month dynamic 365 user license think every single seller pretty short period time sale copilot like think kind p time q think big opportunity u like see lot announcement going way back modern work announcement copilot back march sale copilot major feature announcement think huge opportunity around copilot work q tyler radke charles lamanna q tyler radke charles lamannabusiness application vendor bring generative ai value user spends time case crm usually crm right actually inside oﬃce right ultimately 40 could way onboard broader dynamic license organization yes okay guess mean hit interesting point earlier like clearly budget tight microsoft think really benefited environment term consolidation potential like seen security seen certainly across power bi data analytics could argue maybe seen yet application side crm marketing erp guess kind confidence level maybe could happen next three five year guess ai catalyst maybe drive similar consolidation wave application layer like seen productivity power platform yes like mean high level look say module talked earlier say customer experience service finance supply chain able 1 billion many year running gaining market share relative competition across think something working market growing kind climate way happy think pretty happy go future think real opportunity reason first think hit really great price point dynamic company maybe struggle hit term eﬃciently run eﬃciently microsoft go market think going huge asset business application 95 per user sound like lot relative say maybe something like oﬃce 365 actually low list price compared classic crm erp think price something interesting second value include standard crm erp bell whistle leadership pretty clear leadership position generative ai business application included great price kind look two thing great set price great set value really leading way next generation business application two thing together think really help u go drive standardization adoption dynamic think copilot general one thing talked lot think copilot start blur line productivity application business application q tyler radke charles lamannaand probably seen event past say talk outlook team excel different event talk dynamic power platform event talk thing together reason copilot say excel want analyze financial data want go erp export data go web search information copilot bring data right context analysis inside excel writing customer want go leave outlook crm look account pricing want copilot bring data right working idea le application switching data intelligence brought work oﬃce business worker oﬃce going really big benefit microsoft broadly say think price value consideration also product category merging blurring happening got yes competitive side crm business highlighted price point nearest competitor big conference next week also announced price increase guess seen increased engagement customer maybe large customer renewal table q3 q4 kind seeing increased appetite customer platform result price increase elsewhere kind attractive price point copilot functionality yes mean like shorter like yes think level like mentioned earlier level switching conversation entire five six year business application never higher right would say like every conversation say ceo cio cfo boil two thing total cost next five year microsoft versus vendor favorable equation say cfo really like equation dynamic favor second thing last 20 year defined cloud crm next 20 year defined ai crm think actually leader ai crm right microsoft product market usage adoption two thing work really much favor create moment reason switch today like stats show kind much adoption shared last quarterly earnings 63,000 organization already using copilot production 75 growth mean know number quite confident near top copilot adoption generative ai feature reason adoption large market year early gpt great partnership openai others foundation model included existing pricing skus waitlist gate pay use copilot dynamic 365 use today three thing really allowed u expand installed base q tyler radke charles lamanna q analyst charles lamanna q tyler radkeand go future ai crm think thing going look like really evaluate crm today get like enterprise want go get crm thing cloud crm going forward people going consider ai crm nothing else reason put existing license anyway think kind different trend happening yes definitely top mind customer awesome well maybe last two minute want get perspective yes right high cost running llm fairly widely known extent reﬂected pricing copilot oﬃce 365 talk little bit roadmap going forward would assume sort looking maximum cost moment one hardware vendor provide hardware talk microsoft anticipation future cost llm go mainstream across microsoft platform yes mean like first thing would say going depend heavily business like intensity usage like want run llm every get high usage compared say running llm every sale call going difference based product much gpu usage use second thing one thing learned like say biz apps like always need use biggest model everything one thing year ago version power platform use basically natural language create workﬂows application model use something called lora low rank adaptation able run gpu skew a100 think going see see proliferation model work diverse set gpu skus kind get cost equation right right biz apps specifically kind live breathe would say think work last couple year actually put u unique position offer lot llm low cost fine tuning unique open ai partnership work done application yes think would say thing get faster thing get cheaper thing get eﬃcient definitely trend last year half charles lamanna q tyler radke charles lamannayes maybe last minute talk audience key event product release expect second half year know lot three biggest priority heading next year yes think got couple big event think basically every month end year company say shortage announcement capability say kind like three big thing focused copilot copilot copilot probably half truth like say majority super majority feature work team form copilot related even problem would think copilot enabled kind look still different transformed improved take copilot lens yes gen ai indeed heart yes great well thanks much joining u thanks crowd great awesome thank thanks everyone
