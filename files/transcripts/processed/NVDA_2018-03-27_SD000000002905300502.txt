mileage mile operation many car company translates directly earnings battery life matter battery life also allows u put multiple redundant computer inside system energy eﬃcient computing system put inside car could redundant diverse provide functional safety drive car computer system software algorithm top building system first let talk perception fact almost piece together work talked far system called nvidia perception infrastructure building supercomputing infrastructure company 660 petaﬂops supercomputing horsepower already company giant data problem already said one car collecting petabyte petabyte data every single week data label data factory use kind tool ai tool trained professional label every one image carefully reason label car million get benefit forever take labeling incredibly seriously crowdsourcing problem professional labeling problem 1,500 people labeling 1 million image per month going keep labeling label able create perception network see incredible level train dgxs mentioned supercomputing problem software infrastructure problem future past source code code future source code data code training methodology recipe applied order create model want able trace want able repeat infrastructure inside nvidia called perception infrastructure massive investment something proud end produce network already 10 network inside car car one network whole bunch network whole bunch already 10 time ship couple year call 20 30 one 10 network 10 dgxs assigned one network could produce experiment every single day validate verify many dgxs used testing verification entire body work test data stored time let show result guy let go play whole bunch different network created perception network seeing car detector bounding box going see lane detect thing collide also detect space could safe drive meaning one hand detect obstacle hand detect free space 2 algorithm redundancy diversity much redundancy diversity system everything 2 3 different way 2 3 different time make sure ultimately right distance perception using artificial intelligent network trained lidar labeling could predict distance object whether trained much data robust across kind poor weather condition use camera object detection use radar object detection also use lidar object detection far away based pattern dot coming back way resolution lidar high camera depth information really good based point cloud come back point cloud processing cuda incredibly good icp processing iterative closest point processing registration use deep learning detect object lidar perception scene perception one hardest thing detect light intersection supposed stop cautious always properly labeled ability detect scene kind intersection could much much alert path perception calculating path calculating perceiving trajectory path comfortable safe lidar localization got figure exactly space compared hd map want figure relatively using relatively space using camera well camera localization even hd map hd map could figure additional sensor fact lastly every single car also mapping car technology inside car mentioned car becomes mapping car mean drive beginning every time drive mapping space know 99 time driving route route wo hd map beginning use car car map create really high fidelity map could use extra sensor give additional information localize within safety okay mapping show done every time together show homemade video homemade video latest clip latest clip recent achievement making progress time far finished several thousand engineer right working autonomous vehicle going work another 2 three year ship volume car meantime course going develop offer development system training system simulation system kind going long journey step step step mentioned really
