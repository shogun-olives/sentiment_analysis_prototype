good morning welcome bloomberg intelligence webinar dissecting apple era today wednesday may 26 2020 name anand srinivasan primary apple analyst semiconductor hardware analyst bloomberg intelligence four colleague bringing expertise bear subject geetha ranganathan medium analyst julie chariell fintech analyst amine bensaid also cover medium specifically opining music woo jin ho ph expert semiconductor networking talking 3d frequency packed call get started administrative item begin today presentation recorded available playback access replay via link sent email bloomberg webinars email come bloomberg webinars bottom slide window adjust volume maximize screen also ask question would strongly urge participant use method ask question submitting one right slide area called question answer address question conclusion presentation copy slide used today distributed post event email mentioned packed agenda stored divided discussion point call area one want talk short versus longer term want talk two subject area depth two vector think drive investment thesis apple one iphone install base within talk launch effect 5g think pricing going change 2021 talk second golden egg case would service business within scope service business talk subdivision service laid spread estimated business talk outside opportunity medium streaming side well music side talk fintech think principally ph also discus extensive apple chip ambition last certainly least address valuation leave time conference q let get started talking versus long term obviously near term calendar year 2020 fiscal 2021 case apple impacted covid impacted surprisingly near term le shallow weakness first foreseen long term think substantial opportunity expand install base also drive mix shift asp perspective raise number one number two also drive service one thing want convey assumed apple coverage recently fact apple benefit burden scale term market share see substantial owner market share 191 million unit certainly biggest asp perspective skewed pretty far right certainly scale smartphone volume perspective second part look consumption semiconductor example apple substantial consumer dram nand well logic chip merchant silicon third party qualcomms internally designed made tsmc talk effect scale think singular vector growth longer term china india expansion obviously asp perspective android penetration versus io penetration particularly prc china multiple term asp multiple term android phone sold versus io phone believe two country represent growth opportunity iphone relative android wanted spend little bit time virtuous cycle install base new iphone sold new adding install base slowly expanding dramatically new content via app store turn drive device adjacent product proliferates wider content new platform apple cycle continues look iphone paranoid obsessive install base install base change drastically near term think 1.3 billion ph unit consider iphone ipad max et cetera across platform think 1.3 billion installed base look 1q 4q installed base rapidly grown substantial vector growth term installed base potential one discounted financing angle also program help potentially drive higher asp product dramatically technical diﬃculty grow would financing program estimated sort small bleed iphone installed base shockingly last quarter trend surprised impact covid much shallower anticipated result dramatically changed march june number prior print printed roughly 37 million unit estimate idc think go sort 28 million unit june quarter rebound calendar third fourth quarter 43 72 million unit iphone pretty substantial obviously product everybody ob look 8 plus se 11 pro max across board compare relative previous rendition iphone well comparable product samsung huawei mean technological basis necessarily every feature set leader leader camera resolution processor density et cetera closed ecosystem coupled strong device service dramatically expands ecosystem revenue potential relative android result continuingly focused installed base expansion rather given quarter shipment talk asp nauseam towards go presentation 5g particular enhancer obviously value 5g customer perspective brings higher speed lower latency app experience also drive newer apps richer video 4k content enhanced music et cetera turn lead wider app development benefit carrier perspective also customize delivery application tailor content tailor delivery mechanism based user history location interest et cetera effectively giving carrier sharper monetization mechanism device 5g network turn brings wider interest apps service wider customer perspective higher speed lower latency richer video et cetera customer perspective wider carrier perspective slice dice user pool better tailor content monetize much sharp fashion would able 4g 3g turn drive cycle wide 5g adoption could wider taking effect covid talking little bit long term near term want step back one second look near term look done 2020 model actually done month month analysis effectively track disease potentially overlaid spending inclination result across region region region came unit number highlighted earlier second part 5g phone going expensive 2021 think samsung little bit failed experiment trying raise price go well discontinue later think apple may learned think ﬂagship price going increase 2020 introduction iphone se rebranding iphone se actually brings new lower asp product mix look bar bell curve price distribution io 2007 current yes two peak one 750 800 range one thousand plus range think regardless iphone se increase first bump think potential raise price 2021 ability push second peak barbell pretty aggressively interesting thing chart looking front look white blue column apple samsung huawei unit value perspective see white blue substantially bigger piece apple even versus samsung huawei go show apple substantially richer q mix relative samsung huawei apple trying market share leader unit perspective selling expensive phone ability drag much wider service business installed base going steady growing much slowly potentially lower end product could asp perspective service mix drag going richer remember service margin almost x ph product margin barbell curve talking earlier double bump see one 750 800 range one thousand plus range go show regardless iphone asp starting price bulk unit sold actually carry value substantially higher right think even though iphone se going drag left asp perspective think 2021 actually going enhance sku mix right hand side graph think opportunity apple raise price effectively potentially optically might introduce one two skus higher end spectrum thereby weighted average price platform go want spend little bit time service obviously want refocus two vector growth one iphone installed base laid case 2021 could see improved unit well wider asp couple 5g drive service service golden egg diverse fast growing margin enhancing obviously would know quick question optic slide apparently blurry angela anything done improve eligibility diﬃcult follow data anything isp sort thing client side okay question client asked question happy send graph email following conversation service specked detail think least 11 service see roughly 48 billion business trailing revenue perspective think diverse mentioned certain element might popularly known versus certain others run quick detail also talk potential area growth across first applecare applecare think modelled around roughly 26 service business substantial piece pie number one number 2 sticky piece pie substantially different maintenance program seen strong attach got geetha ranganathanmonthly fee somewhere 6 15 would conservatively assume 12 13 price point fact brings roughly fifth attach rate new phone pretty staggering think business business think phone get expensive attach rate potential higher second app store business popularly known piece business interesting piece division free apps paid apps potentially app monetization obviously game downloads pay app apple take 30 cut continuing revenue apple take 15 substantial monetization potential bulk apps apps apple native apps talk important even buy netﬂix subscription third party subscription apple pay apple 30 first year 15 second year bulk apple bulk apps apps remarkable potential potentially native apps native content obviously wider revenue structure much richer margin mix interesting business fact getting paid google default search engine io product incredibly high margin piece business modeled roughly 8.8 billion 2019 inclining litigation two finally settled default search engine staggering number number one number two near 100 margin number three sticky think piece pie actually modeled modeling every business conservatively leftover revenue relative reported revenue licensing fee rather conservative think relative broker estimate seen mentioned popular press think number conservative relative want switch gear talk apple medium aspiration talk different piece pie service business exist want switch gear geetha ranganathan medium analyst call see could medium franchise wanted geetha want give u quick screening ph medium business apple could interested yes absolutely thanks anand hello everyone streaming become extremely crowded space major medium company launching called direct consumer platform past month fact hbo max went live today apple tv plus actually launched back november 2019 fairly ambitious goal wanted create apple hbo happened little six month later apple tv plus really part streaming conversation kind want give sense term subscriber sign indicate apple service somewhat slow start report suggest 10 million subscriber actually seems like decent number caveat nobody really paying service even though compelling 499 price point one cheapest service remember almost 100 subscriber free six month apple probably tough time free trial start run want catch service like netﬂix disney subscriber standpoint going real tough slog course bit late game crowded market need differentiated product kind look apple disney launched service time november last year kind really come content apple tv launched nine original show far service anywhere 23 25 original really slim offering compared heavy weight especially look netﬂix kind become force original space close almost 1200 title kind look apple tv plus service enough keep people coming back day day offering available mean show win acclaim really kind provoking water cooler type conversation really stumbling block look hbo look netﬂix start original powerhouse hbo made entrance playing old movie classic sitcom syndicated netﬂix built initial subscriber base offering exhaustive amount licensed tv show movie people wanted watch disney plus instance owes success kid focused back catalog bottom line apple need content need library question next obviously money object company like apple obviously afford put lot money course paying show kind put slide show per episode cost show kind take look apple tv really held back come spending bigger show morning show instance 15 million per episode see another science fiction show similar amount look look per season cost pretty pretty high industry perspective almost 150 million think apple probably hoping much better reception kind heavily investing star powered show really made much headway question next kind wanted give sense big medium operator spending annually content apple really want taken seriously medium space looking anywhere 20 billion 25 billion bigger anand srinivasan geetha ranganathancompanies 2023 rather spending show necessarily proven track record uncertain roi guess big question invest library kind eternal question investor invest library buy catalog know getting always hesitated come build versus buy always kind gone build far medium concerned finally kind wanted show studio marketplace could potential acquisition target kind looked sony lionsgate mgm rumored past potential acquisition target apple either take individually kind cobble together still pretty manageable price tag maybe 35 billion 40 billion question apple going studio geetha get investor question two subject one disney right talked realm possibility actually addressed apple prime one want talk perhaps maybe hair given acquisition theme park et cetera second part apple still clipping coupon content potentially buy third party via io platform.you know risk distribution mechanism rather content owning owner le distributor yes sure first going back disney question upside acquiring disney would obviously securing content streaming strategy obviously potential synergy adding disney ip io platform problem right especially mean even lot disney business especially tv network business really kind secular decline especially referencing espn whole cord cutting phenomenon pandemic finding almost disney legacy business go theme park go tv network even studio kind really getting battered pandemic really sure whether apple would kind want deal many business secular decline far disney part concerned mean streaming really nothing working right term owning content think ultimately able library happening really want medium player really need able show need able huge licensed library happened tv plus service really taken term anand srinivasan geetha ranganathan anand srinivasan amine bensaidmedia powerhouse think really going happen unless able get access whole lot licensed content ultimately kind yes effective distributor kind depends really wanted game want keep playing think obviously successful far continue successful got want expand service business clip faster team seeing right requires major stake battlefield one way acquiring content exactly got thank geetha switching gear little bit successful piece business apple music interesting part apple music library larger user best advised spotify hardware splash big content really want understand dynamic business see could go amine bensaid amine take music streaming business potentially apple potentially strong potentially weak relative spotify thanks anand welcome everyone think trend see today audio like mentioned also geetha mentioned think similar streaming video experienced two three year ago mean one hand music streaming think growing around 30 past two year margin remained relatively low around 20 25 think entered phase narrative started shift traditional digital like slide see worth pointing right side inaudible everything traditional meaning like broadcast satellite radio exactly like ham ph viewer audience starting shift top streaming audio demand surged especially expected accelerate due pandemic experiencing mean narrative going change going focused music going focused audio general mean meaning content probably going get focused next year reason shift next slide look traditional audio versus digital see decline traditional audio anand srinivasan amine bensaidalready expected happen year chart left basically radio versus digital audio interesting done expect actually work key speaking maybe iphone demographic younger audience leaving traditional ecosystem much faster slightly older audience rest ph content think going focus next year mentioned saw spotify upwards 100 million dollar content podcast last week saw couple report discussing apple amazon also thinking investing podcast going back question win new era key leader think mentioned spotify largest platform today think upper hand invest podcast way earlier recently week ago inaudible got right joe hogan arguably one top podcasts think seeing apple amazon investing content help audio overall specifically digital audio traditional player one risk today meaning like two section world think probably going keep losing share next year got come back content story similar video franchise continue invest content potentially acquire big content podcast space subscriber growth well amine think stage one way see podcast first step reach attractive margin content owning content think music music kind dominated four major player one said today announced improvement ipo one know universal sony merlin four basically label almost complete dominance music aspect margin diﬃculty ph answer question yes think podcast first stage spotify apple become big enough suspect going focus everything audio related know music starting make music starting get deal artist going happen next two three year think unlikely think end goal become big enough artist coming also divest part audio meaning like show like example siriusxm great show spark howard stern think show starting shift digital see content margin really improving bottom line spotify also major player like apple amazon anand srinivasan julie chariell got thank amine within service piece pie fintech apple pay apple card associated business could currently exist big piece pie wanted highlight sliver business think incredible growth opportunity number one number two think covid amplifies growth opportunity call julie chariell fintech analyst potentially run opportunity set apple could sort inspirationally talk expansive nature business julie take sure thanks anand market opportunity looking really covid sort three offsetting trend negative side overall slowdown consumer spending right know thing bad especially april getting little bit better may sort negative right going recessionary environment consumer spending slowing could hurt kind spending via apple pay apple card side strong uptake electronic payment people perceive safer using cash everything contactless touch electronic payment whether contactless credit card mobile phone wallet accessing apple pay others really begun take positive uptake also necessitates use electronic payment update commerce strong really actually growing even better better rate covid far physical store closed offsetting trend looking let give quick number around consumer spending side going use mastercard proxy giving good spending data basically bottom spending card spending 26 u 33 internationally fast forward thing gotten much better still spending u 6 19 internationally kind ask think sustainable right difference international still much compared u many country around world begun opening ahead even u case look stimulus 75 stimulus check already distributed think given bit bump u spending bigger bump temporary one right keep going need kick come online without second wave virus really shutting thing perhaps even stimulus republican senate talking getting behind keep going anand srinivasan julie chariellinternationally see much stimulus yet way apparently eu making move today improvement international market bit slower slow gradual opening keeping perspective better april still something watched look uptake positive side electronic payment growing really interesting data point come past week according mastercard contactless card use grew 40 first quarter three time higher norm u two time higher international market people using contactless card call tap pay second quarter visa said 60 face face transaction tap pay contactless could easily include mobile wallet tap pay 60 face face transaction pay growth 40 seeing clear increase use electronic contactless payment positive side trend really really impressive number visa refer transaction essentially online transaction spending 10 first half april 10 second half april exclude travel spending 10 first half april sort worst second half april 30 better trend really driving important shift way people behave moving away cash faster card mobile payment like apple pay rethink case well positioned company like apple help offset slowdown consumer spending overall julie mean sort case apple pay potentially expansion obvious one thing growth rate staggering number one apple want potentially apple card compare contrast apple could take trying become financing engine leasing business equivalent dell hp provides customer financing want apple card mind compare contrast peer potentially yeah sort picture picture term picture apple card little bit tough offered deferral payment customer march april heard 20 cardholder taking advantage see loan loss reserve ultimately think lot opportunity card already offering incentive holder apple card use apple card mobile wallet apple pay right give extra cash back incentive use way start use apple pay driving usage apple pay anand srinivasan julie chariell anand srinivasan julie chariell anand srinivasanso one benefit apple card time company accumulating data consumer right accumulating data credit worthiness much credit taking available available balance well paying paying time paying minimum payment could use data potentially consumer loan side likely partner bank whether goldman another partner look thing digital banking like offering saving offering investment account way work apple pay well right apple pay extensively wallet lot might want wallet lot opportunity see road come data company gathering one pioneer offering installment payment buy apple product installment pay installment used elsewhere world popular u seem gaining nice traction apple sort unique thing data helping support general purchase apple product one single add card think could interesting reward point kind opportunity think hiring nature apple user let say amex bringing retail partner retail partner offer incentive apple cardholder get earn point use retail partner could powerful ecosystem apple card got interesting thing financing angle well breakup payment partial payment plan dramatic impact program dramatic impact helping iphone shipment yeah value thank julie chariell keeping keep along ipad yes thank exactly closed ecosystem keeping keep along ecosystem right user apple keeping stickiness use platform yes thanks got thank julie going dive deep little bit go supply chain little bit talk apple chip ambition interesting quietly apple already top 10 semiconductor revenue company one customer closed ecosystem captive silicon provider 8.5 billion revenue 2019 quote unquote revenue compare favorably something like amd example see stack pretty nicely leader space obviously make kind chip mostly focused exclusively focused logic exclusively power management technically analog logic secondarily analog one thing want point one apple chip ambition going rise going try make lot chip part ecosystem number one number two chip selection chip need made apple going necessarily long cost saving line exclusively cheapest chip going made third party expensive chip going made apple necessarily constraint think vector along apple going bring chip one one tightness integration potential feature set apple enhance making chip number one number two potential cost saving number three minimized cadence remember talking company made wifi chip made cellular chip ago separate cadence integration potential cellular modem wifi chip outside design constraint answer one operated different cadence cellular refreshed le le frequently wifi people wanted trade one benefit result wifi still integrated bluetooth fm stereo still integrated cellular modem quick breakdown billing material iphone pro iphone 11 pro max see app processor high end stack price perspective cost perspective pmic power management chip app processor well audio low end stack potentially higher asp product could brought display camera et cetera unlikely brought cadence different specialty supplier thing thing well best interest apple potentially bring back look supply chain talking little bit extensively well looking u supply chain left supply chain volatile multiple iteration everything touchpad ipod track wheel power management audio codecs supplier changed supposedly outside look way apple process change supplier every two three year dramatic consequence supply chain supplier course year two become substantially wedded apple business point nearly 80 cirrus 20 broadcom substantially 7 intel woo jin hoso substantial consequence apple apple starting either specific design going cheaper price result make swap consequence one critical partner apple mind tsmc even though small partner enables manufacturing apple design chip critical partner given drama going trade war part 2 may tsmc involvement pressure point huawei manufacturing could could consequence u china use tsmc pinch point third point would make going drive margin near term even apple bring substantial portion chip manufacturing chip design mix product business service business bigger driver margin relative impact chip versus subject want clear actually gross margin potentially weakening want woo jin ho come talk might potentially happen price likely change calendar year 2020 introduced priced phone price pressure numerator cost pressure denominator weakens product margin service improvement key driver gross margin improvement apple business want talk little bit potentially iphone franchise specifically could pain point cost billing material future generation iphone specifically 5g woo jin take great thanks anand hello everybody want silicon discussion apple merchant silicon perspective touch 5g radio frequency chip actually go beyond chip would potentially basically billing material billing material page see apple aggressively spent certain area number one application processor modem went battery went well rf mixed signal went want throw apple chipmaker three big bucket one want differentiate operational performance perspective include faster download speed may sustain radio frequency chip improvement every generation better battery life mean better plics ph newer architecture support subpmex ph time like call hood chip number two want differentiate user experience sensory experience support service think audio chip anand said amplifier phone earpods airpods complement music service camera image sensor complement video photo application apple always going invest kind chip last bucket bringing new technology support existing upcoming service spec iphone may lag samsung may provide also introduced really cool thing newer chip vendor provide number one think near field communication apple pay help think touch id single touch evolved face id face id module potentially provide augmented reality application apple perspective always looking innovate iphone iphone ecosystem going best breed chip however merchant silicon perspective anand said piece famine secured content iphone fantastic iphone volume high decide entire portfolio low end arpu represent 800 180 200 million plus unit opportunity sole supplier quickly going 200 million sale 1 content dollar per chip sale 40 50 gross margin however like anand said apple like dual source multiple source vendor part trying manage supply risk manage pricing also anand said reliant apple come meaningful risk replacement risk apple chip ecosystem highly competitive mature chip replaced another vendor apple month case dialog main pemex sourced cirrus logic displacing maxim integrated audio chip technology risk technology long shelf life touch id adi touch id 3d touch eventually displaced face id 600 million 700 million sale opportunity eventually gone span 2 year move forward radio frequency perspective said apple always emphasized performance apps processor modem architecture area emphasis.apple relied rf market leader broadcom skyworks qorvo could see billing material rf always area meaningfully invest rf mixed signal chain investment bond increased 37 iphone 11 pro versus 10 max anticipating 5g iphone later year based chipmaker result call prior quarter apple shipping 5g device later 3q early 4q idc forecasting roughly 36 million 5g shipment 4q support chip provider saying 5g 5g requirement need greater spectrum support 5 sub 6 gigahertz need support 5.2 5.6 5.8 gigahertz band well gigahertz band create still create power amplifier opportunity broadcom qorvo iphone 5 g also support millimeter wave spectrum apple produce global phone support 24.25 gigahertz spectrum going create opportunity qualcomm qualcomm gaming tail millimeter wave module standard 5g phone rf content opportunity increased front end go 18 25 apple already roughly 30 32 4g device add sub 6 well way middleware content going yield roughly 45 right rf content 5g phone talking inside phone radio propagation property phone class phone actually need le aluminum housing going create opportunity anand srinivasancorning well need glass help radio propagation around phone incremental dollar provide premium connectivity experience device stop right anand thank woo jin ho one interesting thing radio frequency chip likely made later radio frequency us specialty manufacturing unlikely made complementary metal oxide semiconductor typically made gallium arsenide built relative silicon phosphorus boron phosphorus silicon typical digital chip may chip continuing made likely continue made broadcom qualcomm skyworks qorvo content increase benefit pinch cost know discus whole lot business apple hard given timeframe call discus airpods discus ipad discus mac seeing two vector iphone installed base service wanted take moment talk valuation obviously seen dramatic inﬂection valuation look 24 time fee well average think anticipatory effect potentially healthier iphone shipment iphone installed base future number one also price point installed base technology behind installed base case 5g going buoy platform brings second golden egg service business think potential inﬂection calendar year 2021 total revenue expansion notably consensus would urge look model vi space modo excuse apl u equity modo model attached also look primer bloomberg intelligence system hitting bi go look ticker type bico tail ticker last point pe comparable tech peer get away saying dramatically expensive yes scale impediment think benefit burden focused iphone installed base drag service continuing attach service business let close presentation know much time q email screen presentation shared feel free ping u directly question happy answer thank much time look bi go information discussed found analyst email well thank much time great week angela close call please
