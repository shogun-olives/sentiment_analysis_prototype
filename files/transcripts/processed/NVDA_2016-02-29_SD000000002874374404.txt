joe moore morgan stanley semiconductor franchise excited u today colette kress nvidia colette guy really strong growth trajectory outgrown company last couple year maybe could start give u bit overview guy driven growth rate dig individual piece sure actually finished fiscal year fiscal year 2016 announced couple week ago another strong year u total revenue growth 7 market challenged term semiconductor key really saying u fulfill working term transformation transformation away chip component company focused four specific specialized market specific market gaming pro visualization data center cloud automotive fourth quarter alone one four market grew year well sequentially four market represent 85 overall revenue alone growing 20 term overall growth focused platform individual market versus component chip sale really really started transformation okay great maybe could look growth driver little bit maybe start biggest gaming pc graphic business lion share overall company revenue growing gaming colette kress joe moore colette kressportion 20 50 depending quarter last several quarter seen decline traditional oem pc dig little bit maybe start categorize gaming decide gaming oem measure shift time sure sure think gaming business gaming business represents 50 overall company revenue last two probably grown 30 35 year year year decision really focus end customer gamer providing full ecosystem around overall gaming experience use discrete gpu pc gaming standard necessary increased production value game market continuing see market overall gaming experience continues rise term need focus providing driver update understanding compete overall gaming market look focus gpu experience term gamers actually phoning home signing overall subscription see good list 75 million almost 80 million registered give u good understanding installed base give u good understanding using overall gpu see term gaming using gtx platform probably common use case primarily differentiate show gaming overall mainstream oem business still volume term absolute overall size gpu unit sold necessarily workload see discrete gpu used becomes competitive component market whether need discrete gpu deal duopoly option term integrated well becoming lesser lesser portion overall business maybe three ago probably 40 45 overall business le 10 really focused gaming maybe could help u understand user using gpu tend think three year ago still already point buy discrete gpu seek somebody really valued think gaming audience large oem unit base declining user using legacy historically yes workload wanting type capability enterprise consumer enterprise workstation meaning certain application large audience use maybe test environment joe moore colette kress joe moore colette kressmost focus pc going related gaming take majority share revenue focus strategically okay 30 type growth seeing gaming know wo give specific ask every time meet little bit qualitative sense much price much share gain think versus underlying unit growth market yes actually three focus term increasing overall tam gamers continues area focus look area emerging market access broadband continues expand overall unit continued grow expanded market pc gaming secondly look overall asp also great focus production value game increasing driven people enter market either new user higher price point maybe started several year ago overall upgrade also see move new architecture also entering higher price point seen nice increase term overall asp gained bit share good amount discrete gpu share total overall gamers tend nvidia quite time share gain probably medium low end gamers grade would still focus unit growth asp growth probably two largest contributor growth okay one thing surprised asp growth high end done 28 nanometer silicon pretty long tooth point obviously since product come given u lot color yet sense might average selling price getting product market correct selling maxwell architecture two year going 2 1/2 year key part introduced new card throughout 2 1/2 period time card two year term overall life continued see upgrade overall maxwell architecture gaming interesting still probably 65 70 overall installed base yet upgraded maxwell still opportunity continuing buy overall maxwell architecture joe moore colette kress joe moore colette kresswe announce year ago pascal new architecture across company coming insight year sure talk yes overall finfet talk term product roll great opportunity maxwell well coming pascal okay guess big happens oem gone going 30 growth business mix change least think growth rate get maturity oem business multiple speaker yes think oem business outside gaming probably level time necessarily yet growth position yet probably stabilize underlying need basic type workload growth gaming still see strong tam front u see tam based main driver drive pc gaming game stronger pipeline see gaming stronger believe overall hardware going need drive overall gaming necessary see growth continuing introduction new architecture another upgrade opportunity see virtual reality also horizon also driver term overall upgrade well lot great thing going forward pc gaming term tam externally source probably predicted near double digit term overall growth exact science see definitely tam growing going forward okay mostly want opportunity guy tell story focus long looked software data show yay activision take ph ubisoft aggregate pc gaming revenue growing fast growing even like low single digit crazy hardware would grow faster software environment dependent upgrade cycle continue outpace growth software sale sure outpacing ability based actual card choose overall software intriguing pc gaming exact game completely different experience based overall gpu desire becomes almost competitive opportunity individual gamers playing friend really overall existing set game go update overall hardware joe moore colette kress joe moore colette kressso uncommon see overall harbor potentially growing faster individual overall software player look amount actual software one single piece hardware leverage across growth potentially higher okay great thing impressive growth done fair amount exposure emerging market going little bit headwind could talk little bit see looking forward focused currency risk focused macro risk think multiple speaker sure growth term gaming actually quite solid across three region u european region well asia pac overall china region able monetize quite well three growth rate little bit seasonality two growing steady three growth term emerging market well seen europe year ago due large fx swing necessarily affecting overall gaming purchase still saw gamers look capital market feel gaming still strong priority overall entertainment watch closely term gaming still quite strong market condition seen okay great finish gaming question mentioned virtual reality obviously virtual reality pretty cool expensive feel like big opportunity think rate adoption 2016 2017 obviously going drive high gpu sale somebody already one could talk little bit yes vr look bonus help everybody understand term needed partake high level virtual reality see generally tethered pc pc term minimum spec would make experience good experience one top three gpus sell essentially gtx 970 overall higher look great opportunity either existing gamers upgrade new cast potentially enter overall gaming market little uncertain u information regarding number unit available uptake look another joe moore colette kress joe moorereason continue higher level gaming market okay make sense maybe moving data center part business business including tesla grid 7 revenue grew 70 2014 grew high single digit last year talk growth coming think high performance compute oriented business cloud centric business moving one another absolutely actually data center business concentrate couple different thing happening data center overall computing arena several year continues grow consistently discussed theorem supercomputing 2015 back late fall amount application using accelerated computing overall improve workload work load throughput continues grow nine 10 top 10 computing application using acceleration nvidia gpus one key one overall acceleration going continue see core component data center overall growth saw least last 18 month definitely focus second half year focus hyperscale overall service provider using gpus deep learning training essentially artificial intelligence deep neural network term providing additional information user specific service application specific thing thing see video encoding voice recognition voice translation popular type large data set using overall gpus scale overall application better use overall user key project key area term seen u focused google facebook alibaba baidu across world term key project using deep learning training driven lot overall growth come term lumpy type project clear focus think term growing tam going forward growing overall revenue okay grid portion business looking actually virtualizing gpu capability enterprise consumer segment hpcs want lose visibility segment seems pretty interesting multiple speaker talk little bit opportunity excited enterprise type deployment consumer infrastructure service colette kress joe moore colette kress seen great interest service provider microsoft aws provide ability using overall streaming capability key workload also expanded tremendously term key enterprise also interested using grid virtualized workstation virtualized pc specific overall application progress term working vmware citrix continued grow see developed going forward long cycle definitely business unit lot enterprise working vm citrix actually putting overall production seeing strong interest strong growth really solve lot problem global workforce wanting clear value providing workstation cloud okay great thank much maybe move onto tegra opportunity conversation two year ago would largely smartphones tablet auto would afterthought become largely automotive opportunity talk little bit talk ce presentation guy largely oriented around auto focused drive px kind future asp differentiate revenue today opportunity going sure tegra business probably largest business unit underneath tegra segment automotive automotive business 8 10 year focusing key design infotainment car infotainment relates center console and/or digital dashboard really visual computing capability see across audi bmw lot really type car driving overall revenue 10 million car road today pipeline 25 million yet go based existing design win approximately asp probably around 50 100 different module inside car growth rate really success auto manufacturer understanding importance key technology people really thrive focus continue build virtual dashboard think future correct focus talked ce really channel opportunity autonomous driving one go anywhere without key headline term newspaper interest car really overall disruption technology would next 20 year actually car road driven individually human focus joe moore colette kress joe mooreis different term providing infotainment system want provide autonomous car autonomous driving car focus essential compute central supercomputer taking exact learning learned data center work term deep neural network overall determine everything surround overall car data network information create database car going forward could pleased term platform platform interest essentially data center car amount work tier 1 manufacturer overall tier 1 supplier well key startup researcher approaching problem quite interestingly going question term happens first continue see ada opportunity continue develop market merge autonomous driving going forward also probably see transportation service focus really want change whether actually person behind wheel driving others around focusing truly starting autonomous driving rather ada going question term happens first focus really central compute type offering okay maybe move chronologically business serve today obviously going grow quickly lot car dial knob moving virtualized cockpit far think transition competitive think market qualcomm made fair amount noise penetrating audi application think market win socket keep many year like traditional auto business could competitive yes think high end would still competitive really moving point screen knob dial part car expertise focus sure opportunity make standard component offering every single car going probably move term necessarily part going focus really focus virtual dashboard move collectively autonomous driving think definitely opportunity going forward expansion term overall technology colette kress joe moore colette kressokay thinking ada opportunity wrong think almost two different opportunity one deep learning global 100 program 100 car gpus going around gathering data building analytics capability compete guy develop one picture time separate ada opportunity gpu car every one every car ada system data collection analytics opportunity separate necessarily lead volume road let talk probably first think better understanding using example like volvo announced volvo 100 first piloted car use drive px platform come probably 2017 road set thing provide actually allow build overall neural network overall digit spot ph enables take data data provide together create training environment eventually go term car continue work development platform layer development tool help term algorithm build want car react go forward lastly actually drive px actually included car probably trunk actually running processing actually car primarily focus still ada well seen audi zfas announced last ce ce using processing power building algorithm term two overall funnel term get autonomous driving really focused primarily overall supercomputer kept focus automaker desire fit feel like talk lot striving add value right want able add top platform providing something focused open type product market customer want yes think work seen traditional car manufacturer really interested understanding technology software incorporated car going forward essential centralization centralization management core soul term car future best work fully understand importance safety overall security centralization software joe moore colette kressand overall joint work ability provide consistent platform set development tool order enable software layer key going forward probably see u many development contract go forward actually platform module actual sale term working collectively think key manufacturer really focused manner startup term get single platform entire car necessarily working traditionally industry 50 year approaching new manner start start overall computer platform build top okay one tegra question open audience unrelated tegra question couple year ago view tablet would evolve need graphic actually still think make lot sense really happened yet big focus guy shield effort evangelize get ultimately software written gpu feel like lot development activity let develop ipad port android platform giving superset graphic functionality versus iphone ipad really done much prospect change much guy internally still think gpu intensive smartphone tablet environment yes think relates back overall gaming environment pc gaming one strength overall performance enabled ph even last year focus mobility overall gaming example notebook gaming notebook specific gaming machine extremely popular area particularly leading holiday oems clearly seen pc gaming overall market continue expand building specific end notebook mobility gamer key area particularly even lead towards virtual reality virtual reality notebook also something expanded build exactly tablet well moving pc notebook tablet order type mobile type gaming continue grow wanting game everywhere want term tablet tablet potentially connect monitor screen tv order shield prime example also take advantage capability provide streaming collectively finish full offering joe moore q unidentified participant colette kress q unidentified participant colette kress joe moore colette kresscontinue see grow think early stage seeing mobility gaming grow going forward okay let see question audience eight minute question answer question competition maybe specifically intel acquisition altera altera vocal trying go market acquisition see playing threat growth market sure altera many potential form accelerated computing data center existed many year altera form gpu seen sale far gpu bar none probably strongest capable term accelerated computing data center one key piece term overall programmability recall several year ago enabled cuda every single one overall gpus market gone university research institution trained overall capability using cuda although asic type approach altera possibility term configurability programmable necessarily seen overall market focused really key key customer using overall gpus overall know overall performance capability gpu term programming understand definitely different way actually accelerated computing intel competes within gpu compute well topped midteens market share thus far least q unidentified participant colette kress joe moore colette kressyes really come term sometimes software overall capability able expand talked supercomputing 2015 accelerated computing top area reason moore law likely reach max capability essentially slow maybe go zero huge interest term accelerating overall throughput term overall data center work saw focus new accelerated data center supercomputer world grow substantially still 70 75 overall share top supercomputer world using nvidia overall acceleration hoping could clarify u recent comment split last call training inference think ultimately inference market given historically cost optimized compute acceleration market come unit revenue profit pool overall think thanks referring overall deep learning artificial intelligent work see overall hyperscales want consistency moving overall training environment actually production using set already seen initial work complex translation language translation necessity overall gpu type inference environment seen hyperscales come talking using gpus inference also came referred series back late fall series take smaller form factor overall gpu size large overall candy bar also taking lower overall power consumption offering key piece would exist term existing data center configuration needed find key slot add overall gpu capability series right type work term inference see continue roll announced end fall key component move new year question audience maybe could give u update samsung litigation early setback stand sure samsung litigation work still progress correct probably little disappointed initial ruling itc initial case last week heard back regarding case samsung sued u joe moore q unidentified participant colette kress joe moore colette kresscommission review two patent term judge ruling pleased next part outcome see case little unsure term actual legal system play term think true say feel infringing product using product without monetization overall ip something would like see careful thoughtful go forward create business unit litigation really important decision felt term defending ip underneath product little bit way go term existing agreement said understood okay see one question back let finish quickly looking little bit context 25 million unit pipeline figure curious looked like year ago much grown average duration assume vast majority 95 plus still infotainment multiple speaker focus term car manufacturer model continuing grow pipeline tend see u expand number manufacturer working announced increase term honda daimler continued work audi bmw tesla many bentleys others term piece interesting relationship continued model use platform already approved term design work term additional model continue see see move module way across many model within type 25 million ﬂuid continues grow term revenue received last year well addition fine tune overall model go forward going continued growing model still opportunity set stone continue switch term model go wrap colette thank much thank
