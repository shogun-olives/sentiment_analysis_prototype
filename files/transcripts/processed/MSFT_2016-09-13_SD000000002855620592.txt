okay everybody let get started lunch keynote thank joining karl keirstead cover software cover microsoft excited scott guthrie executive vice president cloud enterprise u today scott keynote many wall street event super honored come catch scott attend lot microsoft event software event see red shirt totally convinced right guy think thanks dressing u begin scott colleague zack thought might nice idea get jazzed read inspirational quote go begin microsoft may make statement presentation refer sec filing risk factor relating business true whether person listening web quote behind going let scott outline role play microsoft business umbrella scott going take u presentation sit chat thank scott thanks people hear okay great real pleasure thank much hosting kind mentioned going kick little provide little bit context term role particular role kind see cloud playing microsoft broadly going forward open question interactive dialog think one thing see industry happening right think pretty much everyone seeing call journey cloud really generational shift computing happening right really impacting every organization every company pretty meaningful way think every enterprise particular right trying figure path go take advantage cloud offer think cloud microsoft often think term infrastructure term saas apps really across wider spectrum different capability think think every organization need productivity software enables employee able collaborate richer way able even competitive able get done think every organization looking business application increasingly delivered way enables reinvent business process reinvent business model become even competitive see huge rise happening space infrastructure cloud right fundamentally believe infrastructure around enabling organization really unleash application innovation specific business talk specific example little bit later presentation organization size industry looking take advantage cloud able connect customer better able drive revenue able improve operation achieve lot application driven data data increasingly heart pretty much every business model going forward think iot think power machine learning advanced analytics exciting time really industry last least different scenario need delivered secure way way organization really bet business manage holistically different compliance trust security capability involved really combination different capability company looking microsoft looking deliver part microsoft cloud sell thing individual product service often see increasingly organization looking figure put thing together big part differentiation market deliver capability common call global trusted hybrid promise go little bit detail mean global side far easiest understand cloud need something work world particular meet unique compliance data sovereignty requirement organization around world order run business hard work microsoft building cloud infrastructure last several year provide service 34 call azure region around world customer basically matter second deploy run code deliver set application solution employee customer region aws google combined particular broad coverage region also meet unique data residency promise cloud vendor delivers whether china whether germany whether u government department defense make guarantee around access data example germany china make promise american microsoft employee operational control data center data able meet specific market give sort truly global scale company operate deploy solution like joke little blue dot kind see space many case massive massive facility one east u region sort see scale little thing bottom right large truck another angle build happening ultimately facility think actually built two mile long one location ultimately host million server kind scale global level something fundamentally believe really company world going able provide part see instead race today aws provider look differentiate scale level really around trust unique enterprise requirement see business trust certification cloud vendor meet whether individual industry whether individual country boundary credential necessary company bet business top u deliver unique hybrid cloud capability none hyperscale cloud vendor able deliver basically tell customer run application run data run code data center able easily bridge existing investment already take advantage public cloud without rip replace every system work infrastructure layer way stack data layer security management layer way business application productivity layer management tool security tool enable look single pane glass manage infrastructure set solution data center microsoft customer data center even cloud data center like aws operation management suite enterprise mobility suite offering provide secure way manage holistically one differentiated aspect platform deliver thing enterprise grade gartner legendary magic quadrant like rate software vendor independently term capability leadership position gartner magic quadrant cloud cloud vendor combined seeing tremendous uptake adoption cloud 85 fortune 500 company taking advantage microsoft cloud 70 taking advantage least two element cloud example azure oﬃce 365 azure dynamic 365 example think thing also seeing industry people look take advantage cloud real economic opportunity far beyond traditional boundary thought lot used case internal around payroll application around document store internal document really around enabling organization take digital technology really reinvent business fundamental new way example kind customer logo wall really becoming software company using cloud power business could organization like bmw many people bmw two people raise hand think lot okay buy bmw today connected example azure telemetry vehicle ﬂowing cloud entire user experience digital perspective dashboard vehicle well mobile companion application provide powered using azure cloud delivered basically looking infuse type cloud capability basically make vehicle smarter make vehicle directly emotional end user able kind transform building product seeing industrial icon like boeing ge name also betting azure big way ﬂy across go home good chance engine aircraft telemetry downloaded soon airplane land engine able provide service engine airline help improve ﬂight safety operation even go far indicate individual pilot well ﬂy term fuel economy able drive cost term aircraft retail space got lot customer like increasingly using azure advanced analytics able optimize supplier chain well retail pricing jet.com bought 3 billion couple week ago another great company using azure example start unicorn great exit yet another example term type company building financial space seeing across portfolio well cloud increasingly large financial institution starting move take advantage microsoft cloud technology mastercard one example company using primarily today using lot new data technology run azure able streamline thing like fraud detection overall retail operation know heard keith morning docusign another one great customer take advantage data product well azure service term running saas service collectively customer driving huge amount adoption got 120,000 new customer subscription created every month 1.6 million production database hosted azure alone q karl keirstead scott guthriethan 2 trillion iot message week 5 million organization sunk identity server integrated user employee security part cloud 4 million developer thing always like emphasize much focused enterprise cloud great enterprise also make lot easier software vendor build solution hosted cloud reach enterprise well 40 overall revenue example azure come software vendor building solution top u little bit context term different piece part run basically dynamic 365 azure sql server overall data platform microsoft including cortana intelligence management security offering well development tool offering visual studio family looking forward chatting interactively answer question question answer thank much scott one point made intrigue idea azure lot net new stuff displacing done think interesting think lot people might look total addressable market azure basically spend percentage might go cloud use price deﬂator asp difference boom get tam maybe narrow view world want get perspective much done azure fact net new day rather displacing done prem yes say part think true azure also probably true aws cloud vendor especially early phase cloud vast majority usage net new scenario number customer looking lift shift sharepoint server data center azure sure ca top head even name one interesting often individual business unit product unit within organization actually accelerated cloud fast exciting thing tam suddenly explodes far beyond traditionally possible enterprise software kind include literally every type physical device and/or digital transaction scenario mentioned bmw one ge schneider electric others example ultimately think pull open market big way starting see would say particular last 12 18 month traditional organization shift starting move plan starting see think new last two three year versus earlier say still majority usage particular biggest growth often around net new scenario q karl keirstead scott guthrie q karl keirstead scott guthrie got talk second displacement existing sum revenue aws azure gcp today probably talking order 15 billion know guy microsoft calculate total spend let say sake argument trillion would suggest public cloud infrastructure today low low total spend put forecast hat think could go scott well think term opportunity think serious limitless term total tam mean obviously limit lot zero term total opportunity think lot going bounded le market size around creativity scenario see used azure today asked say three year ago would sounded like science fiction whether fraud detection whether hedge fund quant analysis term portfolio bursting whether around manufacturing scenario predictive maintenance equipment lot thing never think `` least would thought think exciting part trick obviously need keep growing maturing think exciting part beginning long journey going exciting journey term net new used case enable think exciting thing lot people audience feel like spoil going go smaller group vendor lot big technology shift opened large tam describe investment capex required make business succeed incredible handful company even capable perhaps gone day two guy named bill paul could start company garage turn behemoth going take lot investment suggested sort race maybe could talk little bit whether think prospect ibm google player could think hyperscale cloud vendor think increasingly going thing enterprise going want adopt think ultimately need three thing create kind mode around market one need able spend vast amount money term capex billion billion dollar year building data center buying private fiber building server immediately creates pretty big barrier market second thing need thousand engineer write distributed system code ca buy market none server use shelf server q karl keirstead scott guthrie q karl keirstead scott guthrie q karl keirsteadwe building server design manufacturing capability server level network level storage level managed hosting buy traditional vendor get need engineer able able manage million server large environment big big barrier entry need infrastructure layer data analytics layer security layer stack even able credible want third thing need frankly time lot thing learn cloud term operating scale book go barnes noble manage million server pretty new right pretty new extensional order kind learn kind ca really figure think way need couple year experience able operate slas security trust complaint boundary provide combination three thing creates pretty big moat look vendor market think going diﬃcult folk break right certainly see pretty much every engagement amazon u engagement think china got ali strong china think going struggle succeed outside china think large hyperscale cloud china place google think scott got engineering chop got dollar bank could pull think would outside china place kind think credible vendor could google yes challenge going lack enterprise capability even way built infrastructure historically really optimized search look example number region around world operate currently think four versus 34 want compete uk want go bank uk consider using u cloud ca say well ca guarantee data going stay country ca actually meet regulator need sure would support whether going able human end line pick phone ended kind conversation think going struggle little bit certainly next couple year term building enterprise credibility able get point scott guthrie q karl keirsteadmake sense two vendor right side moat little company seattle maybe unfair question described earlier tam enormous going room two fun time next 10 year think lot people audience would love given outline little bit key differentiation pitching aws fortune 500 two three thing hone customer seem appreciate could touched little bit slide deck love ask think definitely arm race funny thing kind almost see across lake lot respect think side vendor industry think thing important ca ever complacent ca ever think got killer thing going make invulnerable many year technology industry exciting every six month three month something going coming along focus couple thing azure try differentiate obviously number 2 aspire number 1 sometimes feature example invested heavily iot early mentioned like bmw royce ge iot win win first market particular category whether iot new data lake service coming fall think also quite differentiated bi another area think quite differentiated security management space thing definitely looking higher level service beyond infrastructure sort get market something really differentiated perspective definitely focus think area really enduring perspective really spend lot time focused global trusted hybrid hybrid particular probably biggest single differentiator versus ability go organization say build apps run cloud also data center even across street aws data canter hybrid ﬂexibility tends really really resonate le trying move quickly particular enterprise audience think something use aws service use aws ca use azure ca use different category fuel think crowd customer target enterprise isvs targeting enterprise sort maybe center bull eye make sense scott think another question lot investor hear market emerging massive capex two scott guthrie q karl keirstead scott guthrie q karl keirsteadthree viable vendor one could led conclusion sort race bottom price become extraordinarily scrappy one dueling noticed check azure aws community frankly sometimes main differentiator come stuff pricing front comment tough mean would put term part competing price think either one u versus typically competing value say point difference versus say two three year ago think actually cost per vm cost per storage value mean feature performance infrastructure high level service feature performance really ability differentiate really deliver true innovation way possible thing interesting also say hyperscale cloud vendor large enough footprint one way take cost system actually dropping price individual vms really around giving ﬂexibility particular customer scale scale need place taking cost system traditional often biggest bang biggest impact benefit capacity needed organization could spin moment notice take example financial industry starting see lot customer starting move cloud really last year substantial way like joke kind tell bond price look like financial customer quant analysis whenever bond market get really frothy like massively diverse job inside cloud kind hedge monte carlo simulation many spending lot quite spin cost thing actually value getting want good price ability kind match need scale scale give huge discount would otherwise pay existing infrastructure turn kind value part guess one thing microsoft sure rival stay competitive unit price decline lowering internal unit cost could pas saving client touched little bit respect comment microsoft leaning little bit custom odm versus elaborate thing microsoft cloud infrastructure get leaner meaner cheaper pas saving client scott guthrie q karl keirstead scott guthrie yes see see announcement later month ignite conference keynote satya keynote cool thing possible technology going kill tell anyone right going careful give away much kind see cost cloud versus use combination software hardware together kind unlock new thing could example talked ability programmable hardware inside azure fact use called fpga processor inside ﬂeet start enable u algorithm whether healthcare whether financials whether space dramatically like order magnitude shrink time cost take solve something would example cost effectively way 10,000 server really need able ﬂeet million order justify level investment similarly term build data center build data center portfolio adding hundred megawatt capacity per year rate getting lot better get traditional enterprise data center kilowatt term power consumption lot eﬃciencies scale able take advantage drive lower cost procurement perspective really around investing ip technology layer well differentiate one thing hear talk prospective customer considering public cloud scott lingering security fear data privacy fear mentioned describing purview responsibility security one maybe opportune time ask specifically team get security conscious enterprise hump feel good putting sensitive customer data azure well think general threat environment live significantly scarier decade ago versus two decade ago think adversary getting sophisticated type attack happening happening frequently going new normal u going forward important thing think security got paranoid ca take anything granted vendor say hey use stuff perfectly secure run away get security lying often talk customer say multiple layer security need worry responsibility run infrastructure provide cloud environment everything possibly make sure q karl keirsteadit secure core capability secure also responsibility customer code level building application responsibility make sure also invest security app provide feature service help part journey example let say azure detect turn anytime look like someone trying access database called information see called typically sql injection attack got web app inadvertently encoded input incorrectly allow someone execute sql statement database common security hole inside app layer automatically warn given daily basis typically warn several customer hey see something suspicious go follow ability automatically warn identify see attack happening one feature differentiator provide help app layer help keep customer secure investing heavily intro level make sure provide everything term best practice term defense depth around security guideline well sort example would also think one thing help cloud vendor especially hyperscale cloud vendor base level fact many server much stuff managing force much homogeneous environment inside data center managing million server ca human loop think one thing sometimes security expert say beneficial public cloud environment avoid lot theme see traditional data center got little bit every technology awful lot people run script action managing million server going automate homogenous kind prevent obvious theme see environment opening really ca take granted constant get secure even quarterly basis term defense put place particular defense depth approach adopt even someone get something actually get environment door beyond catch albeit ignite event atlanta sure talking little bit security angle could probably talk day long azure run little bit microsoft azure got billion prem server business would love ask ﬂip one think great thing microsoft story well azure 365 scaling server product business actually hanging like champ case lot large technology firm seen great cloud growth business actually steady decel still growing talk little bit long last scott guthrie q karl keirstead scott guthrie think seen business stay pretty healthy despite lot cloud shift happening think probably fundamentally couple reason technology perspective hybrid story really resonates customer often see kind disruptive change happening market like cloud end happening people put purchasing decision hold hey sure going need thing go plan buy le inaudible white board going look like three year ability tell customer buy database use data center lift move data center pay anything extra use data center service data api data capability three location something let say oracle database vendor able articulate able promise helped u quite bit think term unlocking think thing kind focused good set product come sql 2016 went ga earlier summer best database product ever gartner magic quadrant operational database system oracle leader probably since started know 15 20 year past year first year passed oracle execution vision database category sql 2016 testament sort amount innovation product beauty value capability perspective fact tco prospective customer run 11.7 time cheaper equipment oracle solution put u nice place go pretty much every organization right feeling frankly angst oracle price increase able say give value give lot capability price hunted resonate tier 1 database take out take long like quick one conversation happen really really big win think got good motion seeing good traction market versus oracle particular database space similarly management security space able keep growing nice cliff even developer space think great revenue usage perspective kind roughly ﬂat couple year going back couple year seen actual number developer using visual studio family product doubled last 18 month reaching new developer mac development io development android q karl keirstead scott guthrie q karl keirstead scott guthrie q karl keirstead scott guthriedevelopment previously tool even sell starting reach end market still think great role combination cloud think real special sauce kind enables part sql server exact note bull part business growing heady clip talk oracle always characterize microsoft sql server database side market functional parity yet talk database head large firm refute say fact functional parity displacement even hear trust would agree assessment really think think even since gartner study gartner magic quadrant one database business little bit earthquake oracle able say yes cost effective easier use till leader remind u recent magic quadrant think database side guy neck neck oracle neck neck year one passed already top right absolute leader space combination plus tco saving able deliver plus hybrid end conversation started pretty much got good partnership example enterprise even kind exadata style hardware basically deliver hardware software fraction across oracle say let foc three month price performance value perspective pretty much win every time seeing good success right market part got big chunk server product business sql server database window server o tougher market wondering could comment around outlook window server think nervousness traditional server o look like cloud world cloud end going linux need strip lighter weight o maybe could offer comment window server part business yes term important part portfolio today thing hard work really great product coming q karl keirstead scott guthrie q karl keirstead scott guthrieout later month window server 2016 release specifically going point mentioned build container deep way doctor support natively right operating system support call nano server light weight version minimalist think designed new application workload big part window server 2016 think existing customer focus around security baked particular really enables run existing window server application much secure environment much protection think combination resonates well market want pretty excited see grow uptick next couple month come market think trick mature market sure trick think still lot innovation able provide business licensing perspective vast majority annuity based opposed kind license transaction able add continuing add additional value footprint also help term continuation perspective making easier customer adopt since already also think make value proposition even valuable maybe last minute business responsibility dynamic think everybody room eye popped little bit couple day ago announced win hp inc. significant number respect perhaps limited giving u much detail thought hp inc. salesforce client take away say dynamic crm think general perception product wonder win hp inc. perhaps harbinger microsoft little success oracle salesforce think hp inc. takeout yesterday salesforce takeout yes large salesforce shop yesterday planning massive migration big bet dynamic one one public one starting see really good success market broad level particular around enterprise would say crm particular enterprise sweet spot part dynamic maybe little bit european state particular customer engagement solution think got strong enterprise product growing fast think kind talked cloud growth obviously azure oﬃce 365 dynamic absolute q karl keirstead scott guthrietear well see huge upside exciting part announced plan acquire linkedin complete yet kind standard caveat interesting thing assuming regulatory approval right caveat zack want say signal get professional graph say example linkedin know know know relationship yow know skill set worked past insight get sale rep customer service rep inbox exchange oﬃce 365 insight get someone calendar even skype phone voice communication im traﬃc take together cloud deep insight analytics machine learning ai top create ultimate selling tool ultimate customer support tool industry much insight assist sale rep assist customer service rep one vendor provide excited term next year make really come market see lot announcement demo type technology even next couple week well congrats deal congrats great success sql server importantly amazing growth trajectory azure well done thanks attending event learned lot hopefully everybody thanks microsoft ir team bringing scott thank thanks
