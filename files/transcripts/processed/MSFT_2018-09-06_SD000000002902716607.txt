singularity without work huge differentiation offer kind operational data environment kind ai sensing environment cognitive service delivering market library service materially greater competition platform service isv portfolio ip deliver vertically differentiated provide u pricing power cloud platform others couple good azure ic side guess wanted ask oï¬ƒce pbp side e5 sort expensive skus oï¬ƒce good driver could talk security data analytics number different telephony different sort avenue customer pursue get e5 seeing term e5 adoption driver sort today versus initially yes feel great e5 right interesting 1 driver security followed closely behind analytics power bi really feel good competing tableau power bi fact replacing left right customer effectively buy suite e5 say `` well gosh get security benefit advanced threat protection window estate mobile device heterogenous endpoint protection core oï¬ƒce 365 tenet addition get effectively power bi along also effectively team taking skype convergence value immense huge driver u skus actually also incredibly well people look either `` well okay make investment suite roll left right say `` well look start security problem biggest one going start security asset move rest suite time strong bullish continuing growth right sort share within total base customer e5 still relatively small growth opportunity quite large judson althoff q walter h pritchard judson althoff q walter h pritchardgot maybe diving little bit get question lot investor microsoft side well cover security space security massive market got ten billion dollar microsoft sort played little bit market lot money spent customer adding something exchange oï¬ƒce 365 secure pc got authentication solution people sort folding active directory forth sort
