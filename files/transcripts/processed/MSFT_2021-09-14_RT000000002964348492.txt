welcome back everyone brent thill software team jefferies happy u scott guthrie evp microsoft cloud ai scott real pleasure coming almost quarter century microsoft incredible journey maybe tell u little bit story journey kind bring u microsoft cloud everyone want hear kind perspective important point would take away perspective yeah quarter century long time done lot different thing microsoft involved first azure microsoft cloud broadly guess 10 year kind brought early satya work azure joined cloud business enterprise business 2011 inaudible routine satya became ceo took role head called cloud enterprise kind evolved microsoft product portfolio since responsible microsoft azure dynamic 365 power platform thing like github visual studio developer tool thing like hololens whole window operating system bunch stuff fun ride yeah think make microsoft cloud unique breadth portfolio walk bunch thing interesting individually put together also magic happens really excited kind drive customer success forward going future question answer question answer scott guthrie q brent thill scott guthrieand unique advantage point cloud trend 18 month ago satya said saw three year worth digital transformation two month digital transformation evolving seeing think next year yeah think even covid seeing talking digital transformation idea sort buying technology really using technology change fundamental business really built microsoft cloud without mind term stitching together whether collaboration employee whether supply chain management whether infrastructure obviously azure whether developer tool business github visual studio thinking help organization transform obviously covid happened would say lot gasoline got poured fire digital transformation business went thinking digital transformation something priority live today suddenly covid suddenly became existential even stay business early day retailer trying figure significantly accelerate online experience open store employee trying figure work home collaborate productively employee longer physically ever oﬃce security model look like make sure keep employee engagement employee successful think evolved recently thing like supply chain management get adapt supply chain world lot gap lot crisis navigate way think also seeing even employee moving company lot company realizing need recruit need retain need kind keep thing like linkedin talent management business think help think going see continue evolve new area given year think hot spot particularly high focus company think general covid effectively accelerated digital transformation change think really put technology center literally every company technology company retailer financial service manufacturing consumer product everyone trying figure use technology really reinvent business think exciting time obviously someone sell platform tool application help hopefully good time also business perspective think decentralization theme kind question around view importance edge computing see playing vital role going forward well think one trend happening mentioned couple like general retail supply chain management key thing covid organization trying kind reinvent thing case going case changing business process using cloud infrastructure still fundamentally entering data screen somewhere track shipment track many people store open many people store store manager typing think place going world world ﬂowing real time way many people store camera camera counting real time many people store like browsing shelf look like item hot need activate supply chain inventory run yet look like lot people hovering around area hot deprioritize going possible world literally everything ip address iot signal going able gathered accelerated cloud insight going able derived big part portfolio enables starting see organization adopt deeper way get information think organization also realizing push compute back edge provide better experience store provide better experience say car vehicle sell provide better experience inside home going require edge computing customer one example would someone like vw group make volkswagen branded car porsche audi skoda whole bunch brand want know car problem customer call much better experience hey detect problem going reach even going say hey would like schedule appointment fix click 1 correspond sm term appointment time work kind enable type feedback look using azure microsoft cloud inside hard data center central coordination actually running azure starting vehicle next year actually vehicle literally every one vw vehicle number one manufacturer car world actually embedded embedded version azure actually running car driving intelligence driving customer experience directly vehicle think going see high volume high value item like car quickly lot every manufacturer think going time going see coffee machine working folk like starbucks barista even iot chip starbucks coffee grinder coffee machine starbucks ﬂow new recipe new tuning coffee shop another example kind iot workload fairly modern fairly new going see q brent thill scott guthriecertainly healthcare big part acquisition announced earlier year nuance around even enable ai enable data edge computing occur doctor oﬃce better doctor experience going talking physician think going see trend continue part going cloud infrastructure also thing get connected also going local compute local processing edge holistically security perspective management perspective trust perspective developer perspective key thing focusing think microsoft cloud make much better achieve vision volkswagen bus azure mean security going vital component think spend considerable amount dollar driven lot attention initiative talk happening around security compliance seems like really come long way least since covering many year question big driver yeah mean think couple element security aspect think one keep investing security product service given running world top microsoft cloud everything make sure build run incredibly secure table stake everyone think thing enable customer using product service also use capability implementing business specific logic behavior interoperating ph product including product security vendor help protect broader sense end day everything right protect product customer end misusing misconfiguring something unsafe still problem big part focus last couple year building microsoft security portfolio thing like azure sentinel azure defender m365 defender gotten incredibly mature gartner forrester two kind independent analyst firm kind rate vendor leader five gartner magic quadrant seven forrester wave security vendor 12 leadership position across many security category big change u versus say five six year ago think think resonating well analyst particular customer think talked beginning year passed 10 billion annual revenue security product alone accelerating growing fast think going continue see u investing think increasingly going around even take example know lot financial analyst watching conference today thinking compliance inside organization identify insider risk identify potentially behavior insider trading thing like historically q brent thill scott guthriebespoke service awful lot human looking data manually try detect new compliance tool oﬃce help make lot easier even kind detect device accessing data information shared et cetera example problem think new tam creating solve real customer problem obviously use technology make u secure think last thing mention security side think resonating well trust world digital transformation security paramount ability u give tool help secure paramount also trust microsoft paramount world providing data cloud vendor data like raw data base like real business data supply chain customer data connecting trust really matter security side also like trust vendor use data purpose think area also differentiate versus google amazon facebook business use data different way sometimes compete directly lot enterprise yeah think third element something also sort bit intangible think definitely resonates talk say inaudible trying make technology bed really strategic business partner technology bed want know trust unique vendor mentioned hybrid strategy business probably exceeded expectation sustaining really good growth obviously azure phenomenal concept hybrid many kept business well cloud growing happening perspective think one thing great strength fact historically incredibly strong business think 60 server world run window server number one database vendor sql server well yeah obviously window client device strong well come productivity software end user software large successful presence lot trust built customer think part magic make sure provide easy way customer keep using technology easily take advantage cloud technology well enable seamless ability run mode going long time think probably would le inaudible going enable cloud try keep everyone prem know 10 year ago could done sort said think world moving cloud moving decentralized computing model q brent thill scott guthrielet fight instead let really invest make sure product really easily moved cloud unique thing azure oﬃce 365 power platform dynamic platform github really run hybrid mode force use cloud level integration whether around security whether around identity whether around management tool whether around patching back thing care lot resonated earned customer trust big reason success microsoft cloud importantly meant people still want keep paying u software lot capability get better move cloud kind think customer happy help u well happy customer always good speaking seems happy customer would recently choosing run 5g core network public cloud pretty strong testament say hey going bank run backbone guess kind multiple thread people want pull opportunity could see telco kind working azure go seems like answer vehicle go anywhere maybe address want seems like big endorsement yeah think mean think something inaudible moment telco operator industry think gsma sort estimated going spend 1.1 trillion capital expenditure upgrading equipment upgrading service spent 5g trend sort independent movement microsoft happening industry think operator telling okay lot capital expenditure rebuild launch new service want able eﬃciently possible think lot money really want agility thinking okay deploy lot compute lot data center high agility public cloud correct way think wave interest wave spending coming think part working make sure position microsoft cloud like branding perspective really capability perspective best public cloud enabling set acquisition last year right pandemic starting mean company sort cut back way accelerated said look think 5g going big thing bought aﬃrmed network metaswitch two company provide service lot telco specifically help run core network space microsoft historically lot experience brought tremendous amount knowledge helped u helping u build set capability directly azure think barely differentiated think announcement tremendous endorsement q brent thill scott guthrie q brent thill scott guthrieone largest operator world also seen operator thought leader trendsetter fact betting u kind run core network help really build 5g capability think going help u tremendously make successful operator reaching saying hey love something similar think probably example place continually growing tam opportunity total addressable market opportunity way maybe five year ago think would area people even think tam think tam lot tam going continue see u invest aggressively know one hard everyone asks inaudible cloud journey analogy easy use know frame guess said telco trillion dollar opportunity got long way go however slice way frame kind journey well hard think kind mentioned telco opportunity think pie keep getting bigger kind like converting journey journey know take example enterprise think 20 way awful lot roadmap ahead taking kind traditional enterprise public cloud workload maybe would thought two three year ago term moving cloud lot upside think bigger upside new thing emerged part calculus historically people say 20 way like 5g operator iot particular thinking factory ﬂoors ot data system traditionally thought part public cloud think new way using data new experience going get build expect new pocket tam emerge year ahead exciting time lot opportunity lot potential upside tying back original question around digital transformation great thing directly investment helping business get great feedback cycle see business benefit want invest think going good set year ahead excited journey last question mentioned hololens earlier one role oversee lot talk metaverse zuckerberg talked lot next generation internet guess look enterprise opportunity consumer opportunity pretty incredible guess framed metaverse opportunity give u high level quick overview seen far q brent thill scott guthrie q brent thillyeah mean think thing ar vr cusp mean think look hololens example commercial great example using manufacturing using healthcare mean doctor go covid ward oﬃce actually see lot patient quickly lot hospital system u.s. right unfortunately used example said leading edge solution still custom meaning mainstream yet starting see people use think form factor get move kind goggles kind something little bit like glass probably going two three year going start see mainstream ability see world around socially acceptable set headgear time able see thing user able kind richer experience going transform think fundamentally live life think say 15 year ago see people cell phone restaurant saw people talking go restaurant everyone phone seems like sometimes think new world moving going new compute paradigm going see lot people replace phone per se definitely going new pattern experience 15 year feel obvious way today spending lot time phone feel obvious part play really around best commercial vendor lot commercial application might seen announcement u.s. army around program called iva focusing public sector workload well large contract going push technology challenging way help u build better tech definitely going consumer aspect participate well company think whether u facebook apple others going play set card play set inaudible move based strength also add unique value see u well scott really appreciate joining honor congrats momentum thanks part conference thanks much really appreciate thank
