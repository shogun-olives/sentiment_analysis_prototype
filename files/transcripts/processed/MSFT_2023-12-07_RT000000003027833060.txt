hey welcome next session really happy rajesh one thing speaker microsoft always like big organization right positive thing always like well done amazing positive thing big elephant dance yes maybe get everyone page talk little bit role microsoft yeah lead experience device microsoft would microsoft 365 oﬃce team window surface also search browser effort question answer question answer think last 12 month like crazy journey term new innovation et cetera like talk little bit like experience like last 12 month guy like kind funding well rajesh jha q raimo lenschow rajesh jha yeah mean first let say know mean last 12 month exciting time yes microsoft long time came graphical user interface thought big deal internet mobile mean last 12 month actually think generative ai big technology shift bigger put together u last 12 month got lot done reﬂect back gpt4 production year jan apis azure safety trust enterprise customer expect february took large model put socialnet browser think represented new way people find information reason stuff march took step back thought productivity would generative ai power thing affect impact way work done june brought private preview lot enterprise customer great journey november launched microsoft 365 copilot reﬂect back course github copilot first one went clear could help developer incredibly productive last month also taken look business process business workﬂows world generative ai take system engagement take natural language natural language interface bring whether salesforce workﬂows service provider workﬂows whether doctor workﬂows copilot thing thought extend copilot allow customer developer extend copilot specific information lot happened thing tell lot technology shift also intersected work anyway microsoft 365 covid spent lot saw lot customer engagement intensity populated call microsoft graph represents customer important database think project know term knowledge people calendar email document right permissioning generative ai reasoning engine meet microsoft graph provide generative ai ﬂow work q raimo lenschow rajesh jha q raimo lenschow rajesh jhaso still early exciting see entire company rally guy must thinking little bit ahead like wanted ask like slightly bigger picture like thing generative ai insight u like would think way work change time like going forward like glimpse give u yes mean look soothsayer stuff let share already seeing customer yes early adopter program june microsoft 365 copilot many hundred customer jump opportunity see thing 100 200 went really deep invited microsoft go deep analyze impact productivity looked three dimension productivity one eﬃciency quickly get job done much go balance taking look quality work enough ai assist something quickly mean quality output term accuracy term third thing looked effort much effort much grind take result really impressive going publish work trend index think coming day 68 72 people felt made eﬃcient improved quality work felt put le effort time innately human creative reﬂective work collaboration 70 would say course copilot make generative ai make productive also telling 55 people feel ai make creative today ask question see move forward think workﬂows going today copilot ai help existing workﬂows lot grinding let take step back copilot vision copilot autopilot work agency work permission work context today helping existing workﬂows helping everyone entire group workﬂows change reimagined starting see team customer q raimo lenschow rajesh jha q raimo lenschow rajesh jha yes one want leave one thought far ai prior generative ai human being work ai editor would show grammar check spell check ﬂipped ai work first draft summarization human being editor gone ai editor human being editor ai assistant rajesh like reimagining workﬂows et cetera like example make slightly comfortable u like hear hear know mean yeah yeah let give couple example maybe one couple customer example maybe one team one customer people started using copilot first thing tried figure hey go asked u distribute seat across different department go one department based work tell go one function find taking peer group giving copilot help reimagine workﬂow customer gave service department operational company complicated process long running incident hundred people incident would day long core company complicated overhead people work shift incident next crew came going transfer knowledge going come speed entire workﬂow context copilot meeting new person would come copilot would summarize could `` hey summarize happened last six month one apply specific function able get rid lot manual overhead human overhead transferring knowledge shift example reimagining workﬂow another drug research company corpus lot data around clinical trial drug research different system extended copilot copilot people could summarize quickly came latest finding last q raimo lenschow rajesh jha q raimo lenschow rajesh jhaweek colleague context email come around chat document plus message record team saw super interesting thing product manager want go incubate idea process used would come idea product management team go lobby resource engineering team design team could us copilot product manager early career incubation idea used copilot generate know coding designer idea used copilot create perfectly workable mobile app incubate bunch stuff got try lot different thing idea stated brought core team actually go implement saved specific scenario month time coordinating people think see workﬂows going reimagine addition augmenting human ingenuity creativity taking grind yes maybe started actually think copilot productivity gain started github copilot side yes like first guy using oﬃce side like seeing term productivity gain seeing work behavior coming one github first thing github copilot many way blazed trail u design language spent lot time ai get instantiated team user organization mean secret ai get thing wrong course ground information rag pattern using reasoning engine fact engine github copilot taught u design language copilot autopilot working behalf making sure human loop actually accept change commit action saw github copilot land 50 55 eﬃciency developer thing created copilot stack mean copilot stack take look microsoft 365 copilot largest model capable model fact model grounded microsoft graph permission brought q raimo lenschow rajesh jhainto copilot design language user experience use need extensible entire thing call copilot stack copilot microsoft built orchestration extensibility design language made thing available azure service whether azure ai studio copilot studio think many way github copilot blazer trail u one design language seeing term customer working copilot adoption curve telling coming like look productivity gain hearing somewhere like 20 30 like 50 people working kind developer worker expensive think like hang like everyone rushing getting like thing adoption consider like kind experience far yes great question clear end user whether context creation summarization first draft payoff mean talking going see work trend index benefit 50 60 70 term meeting summarization task 80 85 clear value end user let talk admin enterprise also responsible security regulation compliance one thing done microsoft 365 copilot actually built mean understands thing like additional access policy place raimo outside zip code try access code data allow access inaudible challenge authentication copilot understands policy thing like interaction copilot discoverable regulatory reason generates audit log done work still go validation process thing one piece feedback got early hey love notion copilot helping meeting want create data retention policy transcript retained enable copilot work could get copilot perform meeting without creating transcript last meeting bunch evaluation adoption adoption guided microsoft adoption microsoft.com reason one hear customer know roi built copilot dashboard actually go take look impact copilot join custom data bring hr custom data bring sale performance custom data join copilot data see roi gone built q raimo lenschow rajesh jha q raimo lenschow rajesh jha q raimo lenschowand end user really teach new way computing u grown keyboard mouse white gesture using prompt good prompt sale person good prompt organization manufacturing context copilot lab end day copilot going go bit adoption cycle enterprise got work risk got work compliance procurement make sure auto like time value copilot feel unlike anything done enterprise space last 20 year much much much faster think microsoft graph already exists built show ﬂow work like mentioned microsoft graph lot actually think side pay enough attention got lucky like play actually super would say happened go back oﬃce business oﬃce business premise bunch silo understand user well understood job exchange outlook understood mail calendar job sharepoint oﬃce understood document management link time understood meeting tele thing stuffed pipe moved cloud really got microsoft graph reason stuffed pipe customer could deploy product time every silo standalone able exist even pure silo different version cloud one data structure customer job keeping allowed graph get created covid accelerated use microsoft 365 lot intensity use microsoft 365 better graph covid ton customer deeply immersed microsoft 365 graph healthy permissioned get generative ai take graph ground generative ai graph context yeah say bring user experience people using today microsoft copilot differentiation microsoft copilot rajesh jha q raimo lenschow rajesh jhayeah wanted shift gear little bit like mean way compute like first fundamentally also microsoft moment much demand side copilot et cetera external demand azure like getting gpu yeah mean first mean look built azure optimizing layer stack year said answer question think couple way course customer come azure use frontier model openai use model hugging face meta model service announced use mistral premium model coherence model j model use lot model large model use first party application azure openai api done work leverage one implementation one stack optimize usage gpus across bing window oﬃce dynamic azure openai use apis third party using apis come bring model use plethora model use large model getting leverage fact using api endpoint course underneath cover clearly close partnership nvidia course amd silicon bringing picture think waterline work optimizing long time year work waterline hitting large model get optimize traﬃc across first party anybody using azure openai api okay excellent investor relation getting little bit nervous tried ask like number number question like monetary question think creating ai lot value client look pricing still like look 30 per user still like classic model like price think like github copilot like 9 tell talk customer like steal 20 productivity gain paying 9 guy cost 150 getting 20 like give think dynamic going forward like rethink well mean let say early day yes thing believe take look oﬃce oﬃce existed word business application excel business application said want democratize q raimo lenschow rajesh jha q raimo lenschow rajesh jha q raimo lenschowthis user microsoft copilot github copilot democratization ai user basically said `` hey want take core capability used productivity ai enhance productivity want take user like done oﬃce addition per user lot construct top whether e5 construct whether team premium construct right really way thinking ai let bring every information worker every first line worker get enhance productivity sure lot opportunity u add value capture value yeah since kind working experience side microsoft need reimagine ui going forward classic way like good generative ai system interactive like work super good question 35 year computing changed term way phone swipe pc use keyboard mouse operating system basic job abstracting away hardware allowing get application yes going change way see u integrate copilot example window think line shell search browser copilot going blur enable something understands intent higher level natural language take lot grunge application relationship operating system copilot going evolve rapidly start see u stuff bringing copilot window going exciting think new paradigm user experience yeah kind get question around device like guy always good showing partner possible like actually remember surface came bought loved like oh cool kind way almost forced innovation partner side way way like need kind almost reimagine device et cetera mean announcing something thinking rajesh jha q raimo lenschow rajesh jha q raimo lenschow rajesh jha q raimo lenschow rajesh jha q raimo lenschow rajesh jha think natural use natural user interface multimodal way natural language speech video stuff think existing hardware form factor going evolve accommodate new form factor yeah let leave like let leave like yeah tried yeah okay thing like switching shifting gear little bit back kind adoption client adoption see copilot side like thinking term speed adoption support given shortage gpus like see playing give like every client like limited amount every client like one client get lot learn lot think play field yeah open business customer copilot really like earlier conversation customer going evaluation security policy governance procurement feel confident ability optimize across usage usage know go optimize capacity okay yeah would like barclays say like think big team shop guy say want copilot everyone going like could theory yeah happy sign right yeah yeah want talk team tell q raimo lenschow rajesh jha q raimo lenschow rajesh jha q raimo lenschow rajesh jha yeah yeah yeah mean last question like think guy working partner one like view hand like like whole broader world like seeing evolving guy term working people bringing people equation going forward super good question mean back day bill used run company mean remember meeting would take incredible pride every dollar microsoft would create would create 3 ecosystem really platform company azure layer even m365 layer already team 2,000 isvs countless application extend team see platform sensibility talked build ignite coming year build talk developer developer inside organization well isvs augment copilot custom logic inner activity productivity still human various form going build interesting application want copilot microsoft 365 copilot platform working know chance take look raimo ignite probably three week ago showed lot lot customer partner actually extending microsoft copilot yes think yes mean conference really exciting like really nice see innovation coming guess hey 58 second german time nice job thanks joining thank really enjoyed conversation thank raimo thank much thank everyone
