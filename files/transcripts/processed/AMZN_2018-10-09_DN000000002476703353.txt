good afternoon everyone welcome bloomberg intelligence state database market cloud webinar today arguably smartest existing database come across inaudible start housekeeping item today presentation recorded available playback access replay via link sent email bloomberg webinars bottom slide window adjust volume maximize screen ask question submitting one right slide address question conclusion presentation also quick word bloomberg intelligence provide research data industry company credit litigation etcetera plus people department cover close 2,000 company access research terminal bi agenda today talk little bit overall state database market much going grow oracle cloud strategy comparing amazon oracle microsoft alternative database technology nosql data lake carl present summary conclusion let pas presentation carl go discussion thank much anurag ph get started topic today let give little bit introduction know name carl olofson research vice president idc covering data management software industry 40 year spent part time much time software development building database management software product manager marketing product manager past 21 year working idc analyzing researching market time course seen lot change seeing change reï¬‚ected remark today begin talking overall state market general term going high level revenue observation overall market growth relational database include product like oracle database microsoft sequel server ibm db2 forth grew 2016 2017 6.9 saw growth happening cloud surprise strongest growth shown amazon web service product rds aurora redshift microsoft product sequel database whereas tepid declining growth sort big mainstay industry oracle ibm sap teradata public cloud service share market approximately 11 present driver include overall data growth say amount volume data world rapidly growing edge iot data analytics management analysis edge important data science space includes legacy product run mainframe many computer hierarchical navigational nature well end user database database market grew 2.2 2016 2017 stable market customer relationship decade old application database dependent database people reluctant change interesting vendor space intersystems modernized database something completely different characteristic product called cache mostly found healthcare sector united state variety sector country especially western europe australia new zealand dynamic data management software market market includes thing typically refer data lake hadoop software well sequel database called dynamic unlike two product market require scheme ph word ingest data defined system also tell knowledge definition rule data exists program code rather form definition within database management system overall market growth space 2016 2017 62 dominant vendor microsoft hdinsight cosmos db amazon emr dynamodb new development present cloud revenue drive growth would would think development implementation would cloud driving growth product open source people developing gradually implementing thing production using open open source model open source model slow growth model based people using product first getting certain point maturity use product acquiring subscription growth rate slower whereas cloud buy subscription soon go pay use technology cloud cloud revenue growing faster revenue even though user base larger prem cloud eventually sort normalize driver space include new operational data model thing managing data smart apps handheld device forth handling routing data maybe coming sensor also general online state management application gaming application specialized application typically internet based require lot state data operate well specialized data analytics require functionality native relational system look competitive situation amongst vendor three market described relational area oracle continues dominate 42 market microsoft 24 ibm 13 interesting amazon web service 3 look really small really small fast one faster growing piece pie getting bigger whereas ibm 13 piece pie getting smaller sap fairly stable really expect lot growth driving many customer hanna sort tapered bit past year expect growth continue strong fairly strong nonetheless lot damper people moving hanna people moving legacy sap product sap ase sap iq space actually right hand side screen dominant vendor microsoft access followed ibm ims mainframe hierarchical database see intersystems 14 company growing steadily word 10 year ago sort next got 14 actually become third largest vendor space important one continue watch dynamic data management software market middle see microsoft largest share little bit mentioned dynamo sorry cosmos db hdinsight amazon following emr dynamodb going continue battle google bigtable google going become important player future cloudera hortonworks interesting recently announced merger sure going mean company making projection would little bit irresponsible however think going continue important space okay foretasted database market growth expect relational database market grow 7.7 compound annual growth rate 2022 driver include continued need analytic need analytic transaction processing mean blending analytic query transaction processing transaction processing today involves simple background query know processing order look customer sort thing analytic query thing like looking pattern data previously possible overhead demand placed database new model involve inaudible data management capable transaction fairly sophisticated joint type query operation fairly sophisticated analytic operation data analytic transaction processing think merger oltp olap going become increasingly important also higher quarter analytics machine learning one thing finding lot experimentation using hadoop spark deep analytics machine learning still going use still used continue used thing many case people found need discipline relational database moving functionality back relational sphere cloud significant factor relational database last couple year forecast word five year forecast lot company preparing move cloud moved much much cloud smaller company moved production data cloud customer moved data cloud production data cloud thing watch database expected decline 2.2 compound annual growth rate 2022 compound annual growth rate way customer user looking move cloud user looking move cloud using mainframe hierarchical navigation database considering rewriting application year would consider kept system seeing total benefit moving cloud supersedes cost risk involved rewriting application starting look database probably ï¬‚at decline important know like pick database forth end user legacy mainframe decline lot end user database functionality made available mean various kind memory analytics sandbox thing people used use thing like microsoft access forth think going general decline dynamic data management software market system expected grow 30 cagr 2022 cagr following fairly normal growth curve market sure others aggressive forecast dealing space mostly open source revenue forecast estimate need necessarily conservative rapid growth open source usage resulted lot lot user lot revenue think account subscribe year period going major growth driver space document database also becoming thing like including support asset transaction never existed document database well except marklogic document database also adding security feature obviously data security major concern everyone day going putting data especially personal identifying information document database need make sure secure ca hacked data lake space settling supporting role year ago people thought hadoop going take everything quite work way hadoop course designed data collection space driven mapreduce however mapreduce today appears adopting limited role initial ingest processing sorting filtering formatting organizing data rest work analytic work seems handed spark hdfs survives file standardize file format environment continue unclear much rest hadoop cluster management file management technology actually come play especially people move data lake cloud look see data cloud native object storage run spark directly seems raising model use also mean cloudera hortonworks combination need basically rise general den confusion respect data lake offering comprehensive package capability make straightforward deploy manage okay forecasting forecast three market know print small think access slide look leisure see growth rate mentioned reï¬‚ected interesting thing notice forecast top part column cloud forecast bottom part see relational database actually ï¬‚at growing growing percentage point 2 le 2 think whereas dynamic data management software space cloud portion part portion growing gradual growth people deployed various document database like mongodb couchbase forth purchasing license protect investment effort investment putting corporate information least business important data system grow expect deploying cloud lot new development going cloud simple reason cloud environment development way sort say want server certain size certain amount storage development work immediately whereas operating context make requisition server storage reserve time system etcetera etcetera slows development process living agile time slow go database picture right see declining part showing growth cloud element probably mostly end user space thing like file maker forth growing cloud way picture look okay far oracle cloud strategy concerned lot question come important understand cloud critical success factor oracle absolute priority move customer many possible oracle cloud cloud oracle cloud important maintain account control always key oracle success largely reason oracle came autonomous database service versus oracle autonomous data warehouse service talking lot transactional service learn oracle openworld thing necessary order two thing one demonstrate value cloud place longer assume responsibility physical management database also apply patch thing mean database going available time going running top performance level dba technical people work developer create application adjust system match enterprise need rather constantly tuning database value proposition oracle kind database nutshell honest clear demonstration cloud oracle cloud important course autonomous database managed oracle personnel presumably knowledgeable expert managing environment also enjoy economy scale managing multiple customer instance time therefore effort effort spread across work well customer really important oracle mean successful program retain bulk database customer base said key customer move oracle database cloud aws azure google something else would bad oracle level account control split customer attention interaction cloud provider could ultimately mean customer spends le oracle le inï¬‚uenced oracle even could contemplate moving another database system aurora spanner something else would disaster oracle keeping oracle customer oracle cloud important ideally customer also oracle cloud use oracle infrastructure service workload word choose keep data operation together obviously pushing forward well hear read quarterly report management remark see infrastructure service coming time reason also want attract new customer important oracle historically really good attracting new customer reason pretty simple oracle large expensive direct sale force direct sale force order get justify cost sale embedded using sale force sale force concentrated largest user mean smaller user really get attention therefore oracle hard time attracting oracle tended respond problem working third party isps consultant bring smaller customer sometimes get way product strategy historically done real good job managing together moving cloud alleviates essential problem oracle cloud provides direct mean ordering service people sign online adopt pay grow pricing model mean using little data pay little processor use pay attractive several level one oracle customer deal sale person lot people glad know exactly getting control account progress fact said even larger customer model reduces amount interaction need salesperson move cloud see exactly stand audit everybody hate instead see stand online make adjustment accordingly everything transparent improve customer relation customer relation oracle typically find technologist really like oracle dba really like oracle program really like oracle business people friction created oracle audit deal oracle sale force powerfully motivated increased sale wherever possible could help customer relation question byol bring license largely motivated customer demand originally part oracle cloud plan oracle found lot customer wanted apply value existing license cloud order get move cloud swiftly adopted policy remove friction account apply license cloud get credit another reason customer want use license least use perpetual used license traditional form license management people typically lawyer contract management people uncomfortable subscription dealt understand perpetual use license contract support contract well working year sure implication switching subscription think time switch subscription model give ï¬‚exibility obviously oracle like give guaranteed revenue stream time reluctance byol policy general policy reporting perpetual used license cloud necessary overcome objection mentioned get people cloud sooner comparing amazon oracle microsoft relational database sphere really represent different background different amazon sort darling new application developer application developer come aws build application make available user cloud really like everything amazon relation need transactional relational database naturally turn amazon rds relational database service number option including number database control oracle microsoft sql postgresql however aurora one managed amazon optimized amazon aws environment customer like idea mysql service layer take code mysql run around also postgresql service layer go either depending chosen write application gaining lot popularity within aws community redshift analytic database sort data warehouse platform fairly frictionless adoption process people committed aws environment microsoft situation different microsoft lot legacy obviously make stuff spin around long time lot existing customer main challenge move microsoft sql server user azure aql database lot harder move customer amazon sorry azure get azure really need platform optimized azure like cloud environment highly dynamic resource virtualized system need able take advantage sql server course designed run defined server conventional environment storage going give dynamism resource dynamism would need cloud problem two represented code critical upper level meant application written sql server would automatically run sql database would changed microsoft taking step change application run either platform seems like help moving application seek azure sql database therefore azure hope course lot client sorry lot vendor providing software existing vendor reluctant move azure feel frictionless process happened lot lot new vendor developing azure quite happy quite possible could see azure growing fairly strongly anyway gain even momentum result shift emphasis microsoft everything model big difference microsoft amazon microsoft heavily prescriptive meaning put together element need various used case say tool element need thing whereas amazon liked chinese menu inaudible amazon say use azure use oracle use microsoft mysql one several mysql variance also available aws option choose confusing heard lot people complain little hard figure configure environment microsoft cookbook oriented difference oracle coming perspective large enterprise well established need move enterprise looking go get datacenter go cloud need move oracle cloud oracle first job customer retention big way course largest demanding customer demanding workload requirement entire focus people lot people may realize oracle actually three relational database system oracle database time 10 memory database developed separately acquired mysql also acquired role time 10 role time 10 pure database used case memory pure memory capability critical latency low lot data processing handle memory size huge mysql basically open source mean attracting new customer large large mysql community even though many people community using alternative percona mariadb oracle still actively involved mysql community important prospect base mentioned one issue oracle moving customer cloud many customer reluctant increase dependence investment oracle past experience oracle hoping change made address alternative database technology lot excitement past 10 year regarding called big data system sequel database result lot lot breathless explanation system going make relational database absolutely seen happened however new system address new emerging workload well fact better relational database relational database continue address workload traditionally addressed well relational database model actually developed mean providing application neutral query data prior relational concept came late 60 offered dr. ted codd way report data write complicated program could navigate database find database look produce report ted codd aim provide system could dynamically query result strength reporting still relational database architecture designed right fully normalize data anticipate question going asked answer mathematically valid question pose along line query know structure collect certain structure ask question would give answer system work way others dependent structure retrieve sift find detail looking reason transactional database relational database customer want use one architecture transaction another query necessary provide database work reasonably well classic two dimensional data structure list ledger thing sort back oï¬ƒce accounting thing maintaining customer list stuff like tough time different shape two dimensional one precursor structure graph embedded structure graphical object forth demand demand style organization either break relational model perspective database work try impose relational model perform ca perform another aspect relational database require fixed schema word relational database schematic database mean database need know organization data put data whereas new class dynamic data management service including sequel operate basis idea put data first discover organized capability supported thing like graph database case people use key value store document database database actually also schematic different also serve job used especially relationship close language java alternative technology include data lake called sequel database originally actually met sequel decided well sound restrictive call sequel really really mean well support sequel interface go define data right way mark right way put metadata execute sequel really relational database data lake serve three basic function first initial ingestion includes filtering sorting regularization also discovery data need secured forth may either export relational data warehouse may write object file system analysis spark may run spark directly largely sort deep analysis conducted data scientist looking discover pattern anomaly data initial ingestion deep analysis third function data retention cheap related technology data lake includes hadoop sort element apache hadoop constellation project also object storage particularly native cloud storage aws s3 operating mediated hdfs protocol people starting use parquet file access enable user manage data common format spark become sort pay factor standard analytics environment emerging role data receiver data organizer data router mean becomes kind operational data hub data come external source maybe streaming source case also structured managed internal source get combined different way moved say emerging role believe speaking believe direction cloudera hortonworks combination looking pursue space see general benefit lack schema support mean developer go ahead thing build make change application application right document document database database support address constantly shifting requirement fulfill agile development model operational constraint give greater required asset give greater scalability ï¬‚exibility case data putting unrelated data putting database consistency really issue issue formal relationship need little worried thing document database key operational side sql database content defined application code meaning field name actually occur document document become inconsistent make analytics diï¬ƒcult remember nothing controlling put rule system put rule force document consistent primary requirement commonly used online session management maintaining data session data user use online environment important recoverability user session also later analysis tracking also iot tracking iot data tracking gaming application common popularly used gaming application sql system include viacom store cassandra also agile add new comp great complex query optimal operation performance issue pretty good analytics particularly aggregation analytics large collection data key value store mainly used shared persistence application internal data also key value store underlie number document database well sort like two layer system got document management layer top got key value store underneath actually key value store usually used emerging relational database system well going wrap formal portion get onto question relational database remain core data processing enterprise data warehouse traditional boring thing well lot developer going encounter stratum dreamforce whatever call boring relational database move cloud whose know oracle microsoft amazon contend specialized provider data warehouse functionality like snowï¬‚ake interesting see work fact teradata cloud called intellicloud well recently developed data lake nosql primarily served new workload relational database historically ill suited oracle need broad acceptance oracle cloud thrive long term critical requirement/ anurag rana carl olofsonmicrosoft jumped front azure people first came azure people scratching head said even need turn really smart thing amazon web service solid like matter u buy use stuff use people stuff deploy manage amazon retail mentality brand product shelf brand shelf well buy still win still business amazon amazon approach going continue approach put lot burden making decision consumer mongodb horton cloudera plus hortonworks growing pretty well open source model make diï¬ƒcult track predict mean thing open source order know going really need really strong sense using without revenue account itc way survey done time time need measure user basis product order give better view think got pretty good handle think mongodb couchbase others growing pretty well user community eventually translate revenue growth well concludes formal portion presentation going hand back anurag question answer yeah lot question carl let start couple read one coming listener would request question please fire ahead one thing clear mentioned oracle successful long term oracle cloud succeed obviously seen slowdown perhaps largely pace migration larger database legacy client cloud general think oracle accelerate shift oracle cloud part problem largest customer really need largest customer come oracle cloud also complex situation data center ca move ca turn dime anurag ranain word need complex oracle installation lot technology data center need make lot decision made decision technology ca moved various reason implementing hybrid cloud strategy going continue see going formulate plan thing lot technology data center depreciation schedule going stop going turn expensive server storage system hit depreciation limit mean timing becomes important well really expect large number customer moved think seen sort initial rush people demand past serious long term get kind thing going take several year know oracle could speed one thing two thing done one oracle autonomous database technology come attractive enough mature shown mature right got lot people talk beta customer need another year u get experience people technology production particularly transactional one even available yet thing help accelerate process moving cloud make easier thing thing thing called oracle cloud customer box work like work like little piece oracle cloud datacenter people say well ca move system yet ready interact oracle system low latency basis need keep connected internal network say okay problem put oracle cloud customer run oracle database oracle managing database right oracle clouded customer actually support oracle time database think distant future put way sort cake eat start process cloud icing part data center actually keeping element data center physically connected internal network system two thing oracle try accelerate process carl olofsonfair enough seen stock work similar way use hybrid methodology let talk legacy enterprise large customer oracle shop using oracle database several year fairly big customer one high paying customer oracle decide move database cloud probability would go either oracle amazon microsoft like way skewed given legacy investment think one size fit answer question depends using database many specialized oracle feature using developed application lot plc sequel probably going stick oracle technology mean go oracle cloud could deploy oracle aws rent think believe even deploy azure people going go azure people believe centric people oracle system people microsoft system going appeal azure going pretty strong lot plc sequel going move another data hand mostly use sort generic sequel function third party application support multiple database might consider switching database system part cloud conversion process mean go anywhere see people considering thing tend think end day large oracle customer conservative stick oracle used sure would happen try move database another system one one might go say enterprise db based post solution something like may even switch altogether every vendor probably know oracle conversion tool supposed help move oracle database platform heavy investment oracle really see moving oracle appeal oracle cloud especially also using oracle application pretty great question would ask heavily customized oracle environment use lot pl sequel two using lot oracle application dependent ib oracle application either case likely go oracle go oracle cloud neither case variety option might consider anurag rana carl olofson anurag rana carl olofson begs second question case second example gave easy migrate large database oracle let say amazon somebody else well first thing would need look characteristic database maybe data warehouse know ask proposed target system handle answer may eliminate lot would consider potential option looking large complex database data warehouse instance probably likely want move oracle probably likely consider another database system designed handle large complex data whereas teradata rather something like redchip could handle feedback gotten data warehouse user tend comfortable larger highly scalable environment case database might say fairly prosaic large number possible choice talked customer migrated database platform seem quite satisfied question moving large complex oracle database transactional database would lot due diligence examining potential target moving something moving azure sequel database instance proof concept project determine whether handle load decide go route said everybody oracle conversion tool also third party oracle conversion tool way mean would also assume risk free effort free exercise going catch going thing anticipate part friction present making conversion fair enough one last question call given almost close 1 one client one question google cloud platform even running completely irrelevant view anurag rana carl olofsonoh think relevant google course term presenting cloud platform considered suitable enterprise data management think spanner new product build formulated opinion white paper look good see real customer case know interpret going everything think deployment new application initially least google cloud platform number vendor good relationship google committed gcp support also thing bear mind gcp everybody comfortable idea totally committing say aws azure like third choice maybe people distribute resource across platform simply order give little ï¬‚exibility feel like completely dependent one vendor putting egg one basket fair enough carl always pleasure talking bunch question try take oï¬ „ ine get back thank much look forward talking welcome appreciate everyone attention time attending event thanks
