collect recurring cash ﬂow stream customer 20 30 year depending contract incur cost immediately recognize revenue inaudible period look mpv number q2 number little 4 billion releasing number inaudible wednesday next wednesday okay sensitivity discount rate assumption using 6 discount rate assumption actually go website look earnings line sensitivity 6 8 4 give different number okay thank also inaudible bit careful earning call next week lyndon mentioned want preempt call answer thing broad level ca preempt earnings call okay thanks ben kallo baird hi elon lyndon sorry background noise look forward capital allocation think capital tesla versus solarcity asked little bit last time panasonic buffalo think capital contribution thank want speak panasonic pretty optimistic obviously great relationship panasonic discussion gone well way thing work tesla panasonic make battery cell bunch supplier make inaudible material inaudible whatnot also working integrate gigafactory inaudible everything past cell level would expect something similar buffalo q ben kallo elon musk q ben kallo elon musk jason wheeler jeff evansonthat point action capital necessary take place already already funded think pretty small capital climate going forward get thing going cell level little innovation inaudible file inaudible structure put roof really technical diﬃculty pretty optimistic going turn though think really conservational general comment incredibly consumer level customer positive quite naysayer natural front free cash fund whatnot say okay predict outcome good predicting outcome tesla past formerly tesla batting average zero really question whether future prediction going better least evidence inaudible one batting average think better zero versus inaudible panasonic one big partner speak inaudible hear panasonic two big project another big partner affected panasonic working thing thank sure understand question panasonic great partner tesla many year almost decade thing going really well battery gigafactory believe quite strongly combination solarcity technology cellular front added panasonic cell technology make eﬃcient ultimately cheapest solar cell world battery cell best cell world also cheapest cell jason one thing would add capital need business always cash generation growth think demonstrated q3 result really focused tesla side strengthening cash generation profitability current product inaudible future growth largest extent possible thinking donovan go next question please operator q john murphy lyndon rive elon musk q john murphyjohn murphy bank america good afternoon guy apologize simple auto analyst going ask basic question maybe might seem basic think asset value solarcity side well cash ﬂow curious thing change really two different angle one guy innovate form factor well performance solar roof seem great job impact existing value asset base installed second house change hand contract payment stream change new owner trying understand recourse cash ﬂows change kind change lyndon two total separate market segment customer looking buying new roof absolutely look solar roof customer roof five 10 year left roof would make sense buy new roof still lot value left old roof still see retrofit market active market u continue grow today actually address part customer really old roof buying cycle going get new roof solar able facilitate especially like inaudible huge database customer sorry using word huge large database customer rejected solar panel roof roof basically old need replacement make sense put solar panel roof nearing end life group replace every 20 year anything le five year even maybe seven year left roof really going make economic sense put inaudible solar panel going need new roof older also susceptible leak actually huge database lead putting solar glass tile roof apologize meant like installed solar roof two year later sell house lease loan guy responsible recourse work lyndon rive elon musk lyndon rive q john murphy lyndon rive q john murphy elon musk lyndon rive q john murphy let separate whole roof versus standard business standard business size right 20 25 people move every day never ever prevented customer selling house new customer like see cheaper source energy installation already done transfer rate extremely high good credit underwriting able raise financing inaudible transferring really easy happens every single day solar roof probably would fall lease inaudible purchase agreement straightforward loan case asset ownership challenge transfer ownership new homeowner think like buying roof really buying roof happens generate energy reduce utility bill yes two transaction essentially right house roof right assuming two loan try design one transaction okay multiple speaker existing mortgage second mortgage something like inaudible like kitchen remodel like let say deleted appliance way energy eﬃcient effectively reducing utility bill asset house transferred new owner lyndon rive elon musk q john murphy elon musk lyndon rive elon musk lyndon rivegot theoretically guy might get paid point follow asset base 5.2 billion innovate happens implication value asset carrying actually see massive upsell opportunity 300,000 customer inaudible powerwall 2 actually simple retrofit procedure u go back 300,000 customer upsell powerwall 2 actually see multiple speaker sorry see time continue innovate product customer count increase able derive additional economic value providing additional energy product customer powerwall 2 inaudible comparable think like maybe much complexity like way simpler may sound like made house better solar roof powerwall add asset value house inaudible cash loan provided lease provided lease somebody could pay time selling house want transfer new owner lastly another simple question look sale three product together roof tesla car powerwall many triple play think able sell relative right really time 100 sale know 100 bleeding think time think customer going opt three even opt three time think think front solar storage opted high percentage high percentage yes roof tie whether need new roof elon musk q john murphy operator q unidentified participant lyndon rive elon musk operator q colin rusch like solarcity got 300,000 customer installed consult customer tesla around 170,000 approaching 180,000 customer pretty significant base cross sell product thank vishal shah deutsche bank thank good afternoon rachel vishal question revenue synergy cash generation solar side existing asset guy think existing asset maybe generating additional revenue traditional standard sense term utility service solar plus storage additional service revenue synergy guy outlined today number put cash generation solarcity reminder plan created standalone include synergy asset standalone synergy number conservative actually increase think additional product would like bring think people find counterintuitive first find obvious seems pattern counterintuitive stupid never going work okay obvious like remarkable people thought would never work think obvious people crazy colin rusch oppenheimer given said much capex spent buffalo walk u much total spent buffalo much spent state new york expect delivery equipment lyndon rive elon musk q colin rusch lyndon rive q colin rusch lyndon rive elon musk q colin rusch lyndon rive state new york think inaudible mentioned allocated 770 million towards building new equipment equipment progress lot majority arrive end next year much arrived already point think put maybe 15 20 know exact number heart inaudible financial value think around number around 15 20 much ordered point would expect equipment set change materially start layer new partner project think change think material change approach silevo panasonic cell base cell design component technology inaudible going take create hybrid version yes expect equipment perfectly applicable new cell process pretty exciting highly comfortable inaudible best cell lowest price best battery cell lowest price high inaudible cell lowest price think price really elon selling u right 0.40 watt module guy going able reach 0.30 0.32 watt start ramp scale talking inaudible tesla look look cost compared price could ultimately get comparing price commodity solar panel low eﬃciency think get price point 0.40 watt time watt go panel eﬃciencies 22 eventually approaching 24 elon musk lyndon rive elon musk q colin rusch operator q brian johnson lyndon rive q brian johnson important distinction consider labor cost putting panel panel require lot labor lot material order get saving power output 15 panel 16 panel compared say 20 22 panel mean need 50 area bound system start get labor transport logistics need weighted cost per watt multiple speaker significant factor yes like conservatively direct cost reduction panel estimated around 0.15 watt inclusive labor mounting hardware also got think differentiation eye customer well superior product always pick differentiation think make difference well exactly want compete price good make good business trying put metric around maybe revisit solarcity call given short time today thanks much guy brian johnson barclays yes good afternoon couple question debt side combined company understanding course see solarcity inaudible first think statement recurring cash ﬂows exceed nonrecourse debt 2 billion 6 discount rate much 2 billion renewal assumption year 20 seems gross value 4.8 billion looking q2 number contracted number 3.1 billion uncontracted number 900 million total 4 billion debt 1.8 billion leaf u 2.2 billion okay would 1.1 billion excluding rental second related given shown solar roof think going affect lyndon rive elon musk lyndon rive q brian johnson elon musk q brian johnson lyndon rive elon musk lyndon rive elon muskthe renewal rate solarcity panel lease know 20 year since dealing mpvs going 30 year high probability many customer actually may need replace roof within period happens today remove panel put back remember panel essentially pay inaudible customer could repurposed yes could repurposed expect depending customer roof healthy percentage renew okay third question clear going take long time really deploy solar scale ultimately order 70 million 80 million residential well take north america including canada mexico big number maybe 150 million something like roof sheer scale yes north america getting customer definitely take solar roof successful renewal come 20 year may better option customer leaving panel aging leaking roof certainly number customer take panel put say commercial installation put customer roof essentially value roof sub zero like panel still working fine really key point understand generates electricity real value panel q brian johnson elon musk q brian johnson elon musk q brian johnson elon musk lyndon riveeven somebody say want go solar glass roof take panel electrical equipment supporting panel reuse house take long time everyone say want solar roof ultimately yes everyone panel still going make sense kind ﬂat roof installation thing visible commercial insulation ﬂat rooftop residential situation ﬂat rooftop really point beautiful aesthetic standpoint nobody see final question relating debt solarcity convert reading may wrong payable cash given stock price conversion come right b downstream cash c actually convert settle additional share think tesla level refinancing solarcity actually part confirm going sub tesla going guaranteeing debt new solarcity sub post acquisition solarcity certainly debt obligation course sure mean well guess one technically still plan keep solarcity bankruptcy remote subsidiary tesla current abl seems indicate would one company think really see zero chance solarcity going bankrupt zero right tesla downstream money pay refinance solarcity refinancing convert going one company address actual payment convert remember two year time company generates roughly 200 million quarter mpv future value elon musk lyndon rive elon musk lyndon rive q brian johnson elon musk lyndon rive elon musk lyndon rive elon musk lyndon rivewe proven monetize cash ﬂows last 120 day raised cash equity securitization deal securitization selling financing future cash ﬂows either debt equity investor coming buying cash ﬂows feel like lot confusion securitization selling cash ﬂows product general corporate debt none corporate debt multiple speaker focused convert corporate debt solar bond inaudible solar bond talking core piece puzzle talking 4 billion talking 1.8 billion corporate debt asset financing real clear nonrecourse financing looking run rate company looking net present value generate every single quarter roughly 200 million maintaining run rate able monetize enough cash ﬂows essentially cover convert q brian johnson elon musk jason wheeler q brian johnson jeff evanson elon musk jeff evanson operator q charlie anderson elon musk lyndon rive okay plan jason add one point top solarcity 2018 convert also 2018 convert original issuance convert 660 million actually paid 415 million convert done last 90 day significantly derisked 2018 capital structure inaudible last quarter okay thanks right everyone mark want take couple question could donovan let take next question charlie anderson dougherty company thanks taking question one comment blog post revenue synergy quote customer overlapping product interest wonder statistic back whether model 3 reservation holder overlap maybe solarcity pipeline anything would helpful thanks surveyed customer would somewhat speculative know lyndon idea q charlie anderson elon musk lyndon rive elon musk q charlie anderson operator q joseph spaki think overlap model 3 quite dramatic asset think fair amount probably much see model 3 follow wondered maybe compare contrast outlook tesla energy without solarcity considering probably two different outcome potentially perspective expressed pretty optimistic road going early work far inaudible favor inaudible quite inaudible turn case inaudible product offering would selling battery trying solarcity would selling solar system would well integrated would sold package really would good basis favoring solarcity separate company would forced situation actually make harder diﬃcult went earlier year say hawaii utility deal combined solar battery system went u inaudible go long process approval verifying ongoing transaction slowed whole thing way scale going time hundred level solar battery installation want assume integrated system utility level commercial level consumer level unwieldy two separate company thanks much joseph spak rbc capital market thanks quick clarification rod first question quite catch 500 million going include cash hand close deal lyndon rive elon musk q joseph spak elon musk lyndon rive elon musk lyndon rive elon musk operator q julien lyndon rive new generation new generation cash yes okay thanks follow last point reason deal go would look set partnership joint venture sell solar storage combination potentially even look multiple partnership think really joint venture hate joint venture think rarely work sure good basis unless one company mean inaudible jointly working heterogeneous company would worst product worst experience end user inaudible interest u tesla store see solarcity whoever smorgasbord solar offering store would strange would go apple store see like six different cell phone getting sold julien ubs hi julien good afternoon question comment real quickly around remaining obligation new york term 5 billion 10 year comment something would contemplated kept level panasonic deal something negotiated part panasonic think q julien lyndon rive q julien operator elon musk q philip shen elon musk q philip shen lyndon riveso clear basically cumulative inaudible would tesla solarcity panasonic combination also includes operation solarcity currently new york actually think inaudible excess number period none relationship really going affect one way another make sure heard right still confident hit number still remains company even pro forma deal guy engage panasonic still feel comfortable absolutely great thank philip shen roth capital partner let take maybe one last question thanks squeezing key member silevo team leave soon acquisition ahead commercial ramp yes one member silevo team think honest scattered different direction still maintain good relationship yes variety different reason wanting take different direction nothing planned ramp necessarily think addressed earlier continue plan move forward silevo process expect find think mentioned hybrid cell possible silevo hip hit cell panasonic produce case plan inaudible making hybrid high level explain happen basically bring best learning team give example silevo perfected heterojunction cell using wafer q philip shen elon musk q philip shen elon musk lyndon rive elon muskpanasonic yet transition wafer take silevo learning six inch apply learning panasonic achieved year scaling heterojunction cell gigawatts beyond great relates solar roof number company tried pursue solar shingle past number year dow energy conversion device et cetera come gone fundamentally different cost target solar shingle timing cost target dude three question said last one thanks elon definitely appreciate know lot people interested answer question definitely appreciate first never seen solar roof would actually want even one maybe dow one one aesthetically look worse normal roof every one seen worse normal roof without exception unless going beat roof aesthetic bother none particularly attention detail aesthetic integration cell right type glass always done poorly know single case done well really quite solar panel roof area hard see roof french slate roof one style wanted use like could make roof look like french slate could replace entire roof would aesthetically better technical diﬃculty going get super hard manufacturing process confident going low cost basically glass using lot technique automotive glass business lyndon rive elon musk jeff evanson operatorand case obvious announcement tesla created glass technology group really phenomenal people inaudible first inaudible model 3 like glass expensive actually volume glass cheap resilient applying hydrographic almost like painting hydrographic coloring also fundamentally inexpensive process using inaudible provide color also low cost volume like none thing fundamentally expensive know nobody done blow mind area others failed ignore aesthetic let say beautiful distribution process another reason think succeeded went bought inaudible product going distributor sell installer get installed multiple people value chain compounding margin end product expensive yes exactly inaudible overhead profit like fifth power lot interest distribution chain look fundamental cost say cost like inaudible analysis like cost glass cost per pound cost per kilogram glass glass incredibly low basically processed sand much would cost hydrographic printing volume also low custom produced micro lever film volume low basically plastic inaudible durable plastic tile snap skeleton structure jus like snapping light bulb really simple like ask somebody done know wish would bother bizarre reason right thank much everybody thank joining u today look forward chatting future lady gentleman thank participating today conference conclude program may disconnect everyone great day
