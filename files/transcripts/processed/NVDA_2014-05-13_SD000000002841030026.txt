good morning everyone name betsy van hees semiconductor analyst wedbush security excited senior director investor relation chris evenden way santa clara california nvidia going little different prior going little fireside chat chris wanted start thing chris giving overview nvidia telling everyone little bit company overview nvidia nvidia founded 20 year ago started gpu company meant improving gaming experience pc gamers evolve technology improved technology leveraged ip new market first adjacent market went professional graphic levered technology go professional graphic product called quadro advanced gpu technology made programmable leveraged go compute using gpu math graphic business called tesla actually leveraging technology provide gpu power remotely business call grid finally using gpu technology betsy van hees chris evendenintegrated soc mobile computing application tegra market mobile automotive well 4 point something billion company 60 revenue geforce business 20 quadro 10 15 tesla rest tegra perfect thank chris next question wanted ask well casual fireside chat next question wanted ask guy great quarter great guidance congratulation wondering could talk little drove guy sure standout quarter previous quarter actually core gpu business specifically gaming model analyze geforce business internally look two fairly distinct market sell one gaming consumer buying pc largely gaming mind might make excuse significant pc gaming definitely significant part business buying boutique pc buying aftermarket gpus upgrade pc icafe china significant business example element geforce business mainstream pc largely notebook oem buying gpu differentiate notebook define notebook premium notebook like much weaker business seeing weakness mainstream notebook market think everyone seeing business think market mainstream notebook think decline however pc gaming good health seeing think 57 year year significantly year year still well lot new game came fall think perversely fact console first time history essentially pc architecturally new console pc mean much easier game developer port aaa console content pc well think see continued strong stream content pc platform betsy van hees chris evendenand china interesting development china long biggest gaming market ea piece tended lower seeing decline climb game like blade soul high production value game high production value mean high resolution content mean get better gpu mean revenue u factor driving strong gaming revenue last couple quarter year year tegra significantly well quadro generally gaming would say standout strength tesla strong tesla continuing grow nicely important point question answer anyone question raise hand open q one biggest thing hear investor sure hear thing gaming market gaming market dead go ahead get free game android going go spend money paying game yet guy continue tremendous growth continue see important driver well gaming market pc gaming people telling pc gaming decline ever since entered industry decade ago believed would depressing could truth pc gaming extremely healthy bunch reason think biggest reason sort alluded question business model pc gaming quite different traditional console model charging 60 software sort model pc gaming open platform innovative seen lot innovation china partly china impossible charge software find way monetizing content see innovation term subscription term game transaction downloadable content innovation generate revenue software developer without actually requiring 60 upfront fee betsy van hees chris evendenin fact analysis think dfc analysis suggests something like 80 pc gaming software revenue let say say way around 20 pc game software revenue software rest downloaded game downloadable content thing lot innovation around monetizing content course regardless monetize content need decent pc play content geforce give innovation rewarding game developer also rewarding u well going say american actually american know tell someone little american lived decade sometimes forgiven believing pc gaming good health go best buy really hard find pc sort graphic console almost ubiquitous travel bit far east think develop different impression actually another example misleading evidence eye ﬂew yesterday san francisco walked plane always back plane reason know wrong everyone using iphone everyone using iphone yet worldwide iphone share smartphone market 30 live box extent also pc gaming huge america bought best buy people buying graphic card newegg building pc using newegg buying razer pc company gamer probably may heard downloading game going gamestop buy cd dvd actually downloading game like said go asia go icafes see think starbucks brand proposition starbucks place work home function icafes china meeting place social place place people go hang lucrative business moving market well premium offering good u pc gaming market decline decline last decade since industry betsy van hees chris evendenthe strongest piece evidence give demonstrate pc market decline look revenue written multiple speaker account good point excellent point want leave consumer side gpu business notebook obviously notebook side talked challenge got integrated graphic always attach rate slowing always big bear case nvidia aside pc gaming kind wanted touch market guy also question leave pc gaming asp talk little bit asp said newegg positive corporate gross margin sure yes people talk attach rate percentage basically number gpus shipped expressed percentage number cpu shipped people talk integrated graphic free graphic come every pc might threat u think missing dynamic think attach rate certainly going increase year may well decrease driver people starting play graphic game integrated graphic driver pressure mainstream notebook market general specifically cost pressure manufacturer device mentioned beginning gpu defines notebook premium also drive touchscreen think touchscreen penetration seems leveled touch screen ssds think continue increase put pressure gpu attach rate market certainly growth market year would say certainly modeling decline u said gaming notebook growing quite nicely core gaming desktop market growing nicely well overall geforce business healthy think unit year year asp revenue point profit margin well much richer mix u well asp significantly lower oem business sale whereas gaming sale like sale since betsy van hees chris evenden betsy van hees chris evendenwe providing something someone specifically want asp stronger charge appropriately value provide one thing many thing nvidia great guy fantastic technology foresight term innovation change made guy saw declining pc market course gaming market continues robust guy ventured area said call tesla grid becoming interchangeable talk two able talk grid got like 50 deployment think right going grid grid actually hundred trial worldwide well stand corrected grid mentioned serving broadly speaking serving graphic cloud serving graphic power gpu remotely number way monetize technology one making citrix vmware better virtual infrastructure improving one providing gaming remotely one ﬂexible provide graphic power heavy graphic user small organization like architecture firm rendering time time moving forward one focused immediate term virtual desktop infrastructure opportunity one nearly 600 trial running worldwide number increased last two quarter least increased 40 cost extraordinary early day yet still double digit term revenue parlor project question start converting production conversion rate size typical deal impossible characterize right still early day fully supported citrix december last year announced fully supporting vmware esx next version vmware said betsy van hees chris evendenexactly coming month away delay get full production implementation end year would think data use characterize properly think going material business u q3 q4 year think significant revenue course margin profile business extremely good well luck building recurring revenue component well software software maintenance q3 q4 material great beyond really next leg story calendar year 2015 2016 look growth projection sure guy modeling business yes would say enthusiastic grid anything lacking enthusiasm business grid certainly one see immediate significant contribution looking interest synergy last year citrix user show go year last week inaudible little bit preoccupied enthusiasm extraordinary removed one big obstacle adoption virtual desktop infrastructure user resistance department love virtual environment love security love manageability love idea leave laptop plane lost laptop data issue love fact back data get hand user issue implementation bit clunky support video well support even basic 3d application think autocad example market u running today mostly intel integrated supported although fairly 3d much 3d virtual desktop infrastructure support removed obstacle ecosystem like around citrix vmware excited whole new market u enterprise desktop never place played enables u get million seat front million user q unidentified participant chris evenden betsy van hees chris evendenso wonderful opportunity something leveraging existing ip provide something demonstrable value corporate desktop yes interesting business inaudible whether using virtual desktop regular pc repeat question benefit question saying user ca tell using virtual desktop local pc know ever invisible certainly bringing two experience much much closer together allowing use application using local pc virtual desktop certainly case gpus server improving user experience actually broadening applicability virtual desktop environment well wider variety user leave gpu space wanted talk competitive landscape amd/ati former employer making big push market late wondering could talk competitive landscape amd sort refocusing reenergizing business love idea refocused energized long even joined nvidia focused winning workspace share u example making aggressive noise right think behavior changed significantly staying workstation moment charge trying win business eight according idc 82 unit share estimate 90 dollar share workstation amd recently redefined consumer win workstation win one fell swoop increased size workstation market technically gain workstation share wo gain u growing market redefining existing skew problem face gaining workstation share u broadly better solution better software compatibility better testing better performance better relationship hp dell sell majority card also customer well strategy cutting price win business work workstation people using workstation one betsy van hees chris evendenwith sharp end generating wealth company skimp provide sitting 10,000 workstation salary probably 200,000 let say software another 20,000 100,000 depending actually running 2,000 graphic card 1,500 graphic card 500 saving immaterial consider loss productivity lack stability using untested solution strong defensible position market low end transactional business guided price may movement back forth term revenue share see changing significantly story broadly similar geforce well actually notebook unit talking actually large proportion number unit sold quarter actually small proportion revenue even smaller proportion gross profit actually dropping significantly price could win nice large piece notebook business without moving revenue needle data good always like surround market share data big caveat unit data revenue data see movement share movement share would caution understand unit share probably need drilling decide actually revenue high end confident technology started introducing maxwell 750 750 ti launched last quarter extremely successful worldwide think bodes well rest maxwell range introduce year want talk tegra spent good amount time got much time tegra important innovation seeing future making change seeing happening tegra success good time bad time look like back track congratulation revenue growth wondering could break market little bit depth term guy refocusing energy versus year ago especially gtc analyst day talked smartphone market chasing mainstream right tegra leveraging core ip gpu integrating cpu component need build soc multimedia computer chip vision five six year ago build smartphones one market going number market within android smartphones certainly largest term unit tegra 4i thought really really good chip obviously success hoped despite strength product challenge investor never tire reminding getting market made decision ca solve problem tegra 5i tegra 4i good chip even hindsight think think good product product issue market structure domination certain provider whatever ca fix tegra 5i let stop banging head particular brick wall move said still seeing success smartphone market discrete chip separate soc separate baseband phone shipping unit right xiaomi mi3 continue offer product smartphone market continue offer product tablet well looking various way monetize market well provider like shield looking build shield handheld gaming device looking build gaming ecosystem android believe android significant gaming segment within talking someone necessarily buy everything people buy shield obviously buying game people buy tablet gamers buy tablet someone like play game want buy tablet anyway reason want buy tablet may well one actually support hobby playing game well think significant niche opportunity call niche large opportunity u market go shield software work build ecosystem course automotive one right easiest point unqualified success growing rapidly year year stable business betsy van hees chris evendenwe right across model volkswagen audi group top bottom bmw one major manufacturer announced obviously working hard others well something like revenue pipeline pipeline probably right word commitment 2 billion worth revenue sat hand next five six year revenue would come clearly sitting hand clearly going trying win market dynamic working u electronics becoming important part car experience sit new bmw new audi increasingly fully digital dash quality dash say lot driver car also programmability gpu sort touched talked tesla much today gpu good taking data turning image actually good taking image turning back data take input camera around car discern lot environment car driving audi example think vsas call specific term basically advanced driver assistance system parking car warning getting close car front system even recognizes speed sign speed limit sign side road alert tell going fast recognizes whether drifting outside white line alert got blinker moving white line probably drifting sort thing important technology step route fully automated car something map well tegra market continuing play strength see strong opportunity growth whereas role driving nav system driving nav system actual instrument cluster increasingly also getting involved driver automation system well opportunity car actually growing even number car opportunity growing well 2 billion moving midrange car well betsy van hees chris evendenso european audience would know scotia manufacture part volkswagen audi group scotia definitely mainstream manufacturer audi a3 bmw mini limited share premium car think market love talk tesla automotive car love talk lamborghini love talk bentley reality stretching right mainstream modeling suggests forget market research firm say 100 million car 2017 made think opportunity 2017 40 million unit 40 million car one unit per car average still significant opportunity u point actually gauged somewhat geography well manufacture going mainstream car found way get tougher motif 1,000 car yet definitely moving mainstream sound like guy really early mover advantage guy got nipping heel going able maintain dominance currently today continue 2 billion grow even larger automotive good question traditional competitor space freescale ti think significant strength time significant strength computing user experience think early success qualcomm certainly made lot noise wanting get car intel made lot noise getting car complex software stack long product cycle think pretty strong position said think unique depth knowledge particularly come advanced driver automation significant differentiator u software stack talked far today actually software engineer hardware engineer although classified semiconductor company basis engineer would ask reclassifies u software company make chip well betsy van hees chris evendenand huge think difference product offering difference geforce quadro tesla software chip extent true offering within tegra well software stack incredibly important think huge part value provide little red ﬂashing know wish time thank much chris really appreciate coming new york thank much thanks inviting
