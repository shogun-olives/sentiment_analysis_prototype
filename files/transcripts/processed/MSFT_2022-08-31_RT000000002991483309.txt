got business sql sort big leap data think everything sort build history cloud offering infra great storage great ca something data really going make difference spend bunch time money making data product offering better targeted toward customer think see growth think u stickiness come collection service one service data probably sticky average end really want product work together across whole cloud consumption perspective company use data lot others depends term cost think fair value prop data service look somebody sign dollar contract u dollar contract piece data noted earlier look across whole microsoft cloud need make sure competitive market think think continue drive cost think surprising thing last year quickly combination software hardware able take cost model allows u pas better pricing customer think seeing benefiting doubt pivot talk oﬃce yes switching oﬃce 365 commercial specific company noted moderation smb new deal volume recently much recent seat growth driven smbs versus larger enterprise customer much runway left customer segment maintain seat growth medium term sure well thing work oﬃce oﬃce obviously deep penetration enterprise hand continuing add q brad zelnick dave q brad zelnick dave oﬃce benefit customer even though might deeply penetrated offering whether team security new offering come lately think enterprise perspective room grow e5 penetration still room grow smb perspective account large chunk new user think continue account large chunk new user look building oﬃce business combination new offering new suite enterprise also sort simpler straightforward offering smbs frontline worker think growth opportunity job add many customer get value combination p time q oﬃce business talked little q maybe little p. healthy debate around arpu driver oﬃce 365 growth e5 seat think 60 past quarter account 12 installed base think penetration extent smb frontline skus offset uplift arpu likely meaningful growth driver going forward think combination arpu seat growth growth driver might say arpu might tick tick seat growth might tick tick figure two going throw new offering come oﬃce product like team others might charge separately think add growth well even team think phone think room event lot opportunity even growing within team combination thing think ultimately result revenue number like sort pulling switch hit specific

market think lot room ﬂoat lot boat security helpful way prepared today fully appreciate extent spent time deal much responsibility maybe general question know going give u shopping list know got hand full right activision pending anything else share maybe even term thing expect microsoft area characteristically functionally philosophically antithetical microsoft future sure would describe way satya always start whenever talking whether building product acquiring company whatever like tell tam growing growing faster tam fought hard get growth rate microsoft today want buy bunch deal going slow key question like tam growing growing acquisition going accelerate u going slow u think culture team team going cultural fit permission play like somebody going look say hey make sense think got
