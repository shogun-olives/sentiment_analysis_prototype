welcome everyone know name mark moerdler cover global software bernstein distinct pleasure welcome takeshi numoto corporate vp cloud enterprise takeshi microsoft since 1997 brings today discussion deep knowledge microsoft commercial product commercial cloud solution since jacket take mine roll sleeve hold inaudible okay want relaxed lay lot interesting question going start would call speed dating question blast question get quick answer question investor asked u high level give inaudible like start high level make microsoft cloud platform product talk externally microsoft cloud cloud run rate revenue metric example talking commercial cloud service offering includes thing like azure inclusive underlying offer like em power bi well oﬃce 365 dynamic 365 excellent high level many datacenter region worldwide takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler well really customer demand driven sense customer need term environment look complex whether regulatory requirement like data residency ability really datacenters close wherever want deploy application solution kind look term giving customer option able deploy solution application closer either employee market trying address big datacenter region datacenter comparable microsoft amazon google might build one thing first want clarify talk 38 region azure something may heard region datacenter region essentially logical representation one datacenters typically set region represented huge datacenters one large datacenter region case typically aggregating multiple datacenter location within network latency proximity logically represent one logical datacenter call region 38 announced world basically competition offer wide margin like said reason offer really geared towards enterprise need think one key reason enterprise customer look u ability deploy application solution closer need application solution deployed also unique sense offer essentially global provider legally licensed operate cloud service offer china offer partner called 21vianet also unique essentially data trustee model germany datacenter offering germany data controlled term access data controlled partner microsoft directly give particularly customer germany europe additional isolation term data sovereignty great thank big datacenter footprint mean could say built support 10 world compute mean fair metric takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdleryou built date share bunch collateral term sheer scale datacenters quite impressive sometimes people talk cloud lot people immersed kind thing like server room think well cloud sheer scale datacenters let alone sheer scale region aggregate multiple datacenters quite staggering could sort show sort video reel ph talk amount concrete used one datacenter number cabling used one datacenter exceed essentially circumvent encircle earth multiple time thing like scale quite impressive sense term built capture big portion world capacity think question implies cloud largely sort mere shift trend ph u sort customer adoption pattern bear cloud course place shift workload many time cloud also place new thing want advanced analytics want learn machine machine learning inaudible want apply data may activity done surely thinking building datacenter capacity percentage world computing capacity even capacity really basis customer demand basically scaling meet need customer demand consumption growth azure substantial q1 think talked compute azure compute growth doubling year year overall consumption growth around 120 year year basically looking seeing customer interest consumption growth across world keep capacity think ratio talked okay fair little detail azure adoption cycle still early adopter guy kicking tire enterprise running large production enterprise workload think takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto would say certainly early adopter would say best one way think almost like early inning play baseball okay everybody playing game everybody game varying degree customer starting sort tiptoe water maybe saas application like oﬃce 365 azure maybe something like disaster recovery customer far deeper term really deploying application like sap running azure question essentially answer question participation cloud really taking across customer base degree sophistication still high variable level participation cloud think broadened dramatically last year okay expect continue obviously yes good excellent microsoft cloud value proposition customer versus sort enterprise software vendor workday vendor future see customer using multiple cloud like azure aws compute oracle workday apps think world moving next number year journey see customer going entry point journey cloud could different depending customer customer may start mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdlerby introducing saas application environment whether oﬃce 365 dynamic 365 may one part journey might start infrastructure first may start something like storage disaster recovery might actually start using cloud term developing net new application sort hard conceive deploy particularly around thing like new data ai type application whether start saas first infrastructure first net new application cloud first see customer evolving end needing three might actually start one three different scenario time customer essentially need whether saas thing ph thing net new application development platform see customer number q1 example talked fortune 500 company 90 fortune 500 customer running business microsoft cloud 60 running three microsoft cloud offering basically improvement year year kind go show u customer may start one different entry point actually evolving use compared vendor really ph approach far comprehensive see even partner like sap basically bring application run azure made announcement week ago application know enterprise stand alone never silo integrated different application data need shared across different application huge role horizontal application platform cloud platform like azure play course customer want go essentially deploy saas application purely sap workday actually connector integration point whether thing like active directory go integrate want make sure customer way use azure whether conjunction existing saas app using azure horizontal line business model okay brilliant one ph number said 60 customer running 90 fortune 500 running three solution still early inning within opportunity build use azure correct yes first 60 within 90 takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numotookay actually 60 multiple speaker base talk three sure even within three 60 already using three service lot consumption growth opportunity may starting use one three service use volume service addition consuming service lot opportunity excellent provide sense opportunity azure saas solution vendor building running top azure gave sap example big going run think could run azure going saas member quite sure get particularly fixated notion saas interesting really think opportunity essentially enterprise isv application essentially move take advantage something like azure given historical relationship many enterprise isvs opportunity work talk enterprise isv solution take advantage cloud also move essentially business model one cloud example esri delivers geospatial solution top azure historically solution bring cloud solution cloud teninose ph core vacuum ph solution historically solution working u inaudible via cloud opportunity think whether delivered sort multitenant saas application deliver essentially cloud host solution necessary saas multitenant huge opportunity u work enterprise isvs bring solution azure help essentially transform business time also opportunity work net new isvs net new world developing net new solution offer sort faster hopefully better chance succeeding marketplace use azure ingrate enterprise environment enterprise customer example necessarily want set another directory authentication scheme new saas vendor particularly established ph player offer help saying hey integrate azure azure ad ph example offer sort unified authentication scheme application enterprise cio csos would like mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdlerto able able manage application opportunity onboard net new enterprise isv stack ph well whether helping transform existing enterprise isvs bring net new enterprise isvs azure think great opportunity course catalyze consumption azure following azure versus cloud platform building datacenter well think boil three four thing focused microsoft cloud level initially azure segment sort microsoft cloud segment focused first talked sort global scale set level region actually address data residency need essentially deploy far option competition offer term able deploy solution application closer need whether market employee partner one advantage much focused really making easy partner customer able trust cloud implementation model trust huge deal key enterprise design point u think work around security amount compliance work far compliance certification global cloud vendor think soc ph iso even vertical compliance standard like hipaa pci name competition essentially lower barrier customer partner use azure huge differentiation point thirdly think big one really deep notion hybrid u hybrid mere notion connecting public cloud even moving virtual machine public cloud far complete consistency platform way application layer thing like productivity business application data technology like sql way identity infrastructure provide really consistent platform essentially enables partner customer able much ﬂexible deployment model focus app deploy think best way deploy three big differentiation versus others takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numotoexcellent define approach almost giving client ramp cloud versus rip replace ph cloud certainly part like said lot cloud consumption taking place initially lift shift right also using net new also like new scenario combine already net new mean isolation oftentimes share data share technology already using cloud extend focusing much energy ai machine learning creates new use case well u cloud perspective consumption almost prime directive right want everything drive cloud adoption consumption could enriching new offering like delivering new offering use case like ai would like able add speech recognition application would like scenario face detection useful emotion detection useful application offer apis use build apps azure certainly add new scenario business opportunity monetization opportunity apis offer also broader application consumption brings sure similarly focused essentially expanding tam speak cloud offering embracing os solution think supporting variant linux including red hat operating system support broad set os technology whether mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numotodata side like mysql mungo ph language framework lot os developer familiar spending lot time making sure sdks php goldman sachs ph whatnot bring os developer azure certainly showing customer adoption think azure vms quarter vms running azure linux right right okay opening opportunity opening linux saas guy many running linux capability shrink opportunity window server necessarily think might expect fairly rigorous tracking installed base sort share enterprise term percentage server stop running ph enterprise window versus linux initially seeing dramatic shift term window business regard continues pretty healthy even think business result q1 reported growth premium version server product part customer become increasingly sophisticated use cloud ph want technology sort compatible copasetic model driving sort higher addition adoption server initially think cloud transition essentially shrinkage window server opportunity really certainly cloud giving u opportunity participate market participated linux market embracing following feel investor comfortable window business continuing growing business given put take everything else certainly think lifetime value window server whether healthy growing mix annuity actually thing like azure hybrid use right baking annuity business model essentially buy window server actually take license deploy essentially run window server cheaply azure basically almost think hybrid business model one way make sure customer journey cloud accretive business overall mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler excellent one window think much window server use case tied hosting traditional microsoft window workload like exchange sharepoint et cetera look use case vast amount application deployed window server application like sharepoint exchange certainly important application u term overall impact installed base window server mean would say dominant okay changing gear dynamic really investor really focused yet dynamic yet quarter really good result dynamic crm online cloud version seemed growing fast focus dynamic product midmarket enterprise think well think historically might recalling asset originally started dynamic business based acquisition centered around midmarket right might cause hey kind asset think business growth seeing really really strong business growth would call vpe space well increasingly dynamic business midmarket business certainly growing rapidly enterprise well market win whether vhv switcher salesforce get customer like american online ph adopting crm seeing adoption enterprise sure takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numotoand today predominantly dynamic crm think long term mixed vrp new product within dynamic family well actually one thing recently done spend ph time increasingly announced new approach biz apps going market unified branding around dynamic 365 really break sort silo exist market today crm erp treated completely differently kind segregation duty separation segmentation largely vendor based customer really want ability think really hey actually run business best way possible essentially lead way cash gone onto market available today market called dynamic 365 essentially unifies asset traditionally used call dynamic crm well erp asset basically one unified cloud offering essentially handle process addition addition unifying sort ph crm product erp product also done way one large monolithic thing buy want start customer service want start sale automation want start field service project service automation get going essentially scenario like knowing fully well platform fully integrated add additional application business application actually consume capability done way actually start way think way approach product even pricing model licensing modeling quite disruptive marketplace quite bullish excellent fully integrated dynamic 365 span oﬃce 365 similar name azure product dynamic 365 unified biz app offering across sort crm business process way operation finance product biz app mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdlersuite integrate oﬃce 365 lot capability offer get email oﬃce 365 within outlook let say customer emailing includes like quote number whatever right would recognize essentially prompt quote backend system dynamic 365 lot integration across product dynamic 365 encompass oﬃce 365 basically peer product integrate across future upsell opportunity absolutely okay give u sense advantage oﬃce 365 dynamic 365 azure much big think sell module upsell sell suite big sticky opportunity well mean number quoted think sort speak point seeing customer use multiple cloud offering right going 60 fortune 500 20 point increase year year substantial movement takeshi numoto mark moerdler q unidentified participant q mark moerdler takeshi numotoright think speak power really thinking microsoft cloud holistically think get lot question community essentially attempt take kind think narrow comparative view azure versus aws google versus oﬃce 365 pretty narrow way real power seeing customer adoption cloud end needing element cloud uniquely positioned able address need holistically opportunity able essentially address need across different cloud need seeing number think excellent let open couple question audience keep question short able make sure repeat mic thank question answer technical diﬃculty question go methodology internal thinking term insourcing datacenters versus outsourcing well say insource outsource use sound like asking kind kind question whether facility leased want make sure like actually run datacenter operation like azure datacenters somehow outsourced term operation whether underlying asset leased built one clarification wanted really hate might like answer really basis sometimes know think ability get market quickly sometimes lease might faster option build might take slightly longer might imagine think long term cost build q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numotomight slightly cheaper like think element basis think best way none business fixed stone sense region encompasses multiple datacenters given region might encompass datacenters two different implementation model one leased one built one region represent customer really implementation detail think way excellent next question good easy look microsoft cloud vision look commercial side business expectation much fast transformation ph cloud going fast like go well guess would always like go faster right right ask inaudible hey azure growth pretty substantial satisfied would say hey want course say want tell want time inaudible overall think quite encouraged growth seeing continuing see growth consumption compute consumption like said doubled year year first time ongoing quite lot work notion essentially real technology stack bring bear public cloud also consistent platform customer use prem seem resonating really also helping cloud approach also helping u address new tam participate overall think quite bullish excellent would limiting factor continuing grow rate growing within azure business oﬃce 365 business q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdlerhmm maybe well course always execute better go faster across azure side need great job consistently balancing two key growth lever one acquire new customer basically adding 200 subscription week high run rate either customer acquisition time great job customer acquired growing consumption right make product easier use engage customer sale resource investment made actually help accelerate consumption cloud thing go continue fully execute really upon market momentum clearly ph behind u really upon u seize opportunity excellent changing gear sql server see biggest direct competitor sql server would compare oracle delivers today versus aurora ph delivers today think really disruptive value proposition particularly sql server 2016 think value capability added product whether capability advanced analytics right top database oltp ph performance implement made bi ph capability added would essentially product oracle product realm right takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler documented roi difference total cost ownership basically 12x cheaper really bringing differentiated value prop table folk like gartner really recognizes u sense like right top corner magic quadrant two year row right sort bringing increased value proposition table really seeing opportunity growth business existing base also taking share excellent see key differentiator new version sql server could drive adoption well total tco ph value difference capability inaudible talked think big lever another one worth talking go previous statement around hybrid really thinking deeply mean deliver hybrid capability sql 2016 actually deploy sql 2016 basically set policy portion table getting drifted ph stored cloud application remain unchanged database would basically provide unified query back data sits across cloud right example delivering true example really rich example hybrid use case premise sale motion really catalyze also dialog around cloud way make sense customer sql 2016 growth opportunity sql license business per se also great way engage customer cloud excellent takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numotooﬃce 365 e3 version e5 version market today see core thing driving going drive people e5 end future possibility keeping expand market term capability price two answer actually probably three one oﬃce 365 e5 motion per se within sort product dialog seeing tremendous amount customer reaction particularly around security value proposition approach security product essentially intrinsic securing workload customer customer want secure oﬃce 365 workload right security element oﬃce 365 particularly thing like advanced threat protection really resonating security portion e5 rally ph proposition think going really well certainly lot accelerate adoption essentially analytics voice capability really happy fact way participating market big market opportunity opportunity grow term advanced analytics bi also voice e5 vehicle give u lot opportunity excellent okay e5 give opportunity especially security side heard earlier today another speaker much resonating security compliance et cetera analytics seems part important voice ph capability within e5 sure sort best person talk opportunity voice huge opportunity horizontal application essentially necessary something small population employee need something everybody need right lot resonance compatibility way general sell cloud generally bullish opportunity q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler q unidentified participant q mark moerdler takeshi numotoone thing talk term relation e5 oﬃce 365 e5 great opportunity also helping company rally around particularly around notion security creating offering called secure productive enterprise right really make easy customer buy essentially product across window oﬃce em altogether right essentially upsell opportunity security perspective making easy customer buy transact u way solution essentially protects window device protects mobile device protects oﬃce 365 environment across endpoint actually something bullish excellent let see another question audience continue yes technical diﬃculty question azure stack customer feedback customer interest feedback azure stack tremendous seen forget exact number certainly higher expected number term downloads customer trying dropped essentially technical preview night week month ago customer feedback interest strategy really delivering hybrid cloud solution use public cloud service well create environment highly compatible offer public cloud resonating really well q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler excellent let ask little azure since obviously lot question space azure accelerated quarter obviously quite bullish opportunity company building datacenters driving simply fact moving little farther inning people driving adoption magic going think sort combination three factor one seeing quite healthy growth existing customer right customer get going azure month month year year consumption customer already acquired azure going well big driver consumption growth another one course really focused addition consumption growth acquiring new customer talked 200,000 new subscription sort metric look term velocity customer acquisition need get customer started right initial consumption might small get going quickly possible grow time thirdly consumption grows seeing really healthy growth premium service consumption growth happens customer use pattern use case become sophisticated perhaps may originally sort base compute storage network initially seeing good growth thing call azure premium service like database service advanced analytics service machine learning service seeing think nine consecutive quarter term ph growth premium service essentially catalyzing consumption growth takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numotoexcellent move stack premium version thing going continue drive coning improvement premium done add capability well think three thing one certainly continue invest product make product richer better time secondarily seeing nice roi sale investment made term really dedicated resource engage deeply customer use cloud deeper sophisticated way continuing sort drive good return another one thirdly work isv ecosystem tech solution isvs partner si partner build term practice deliver value end customer building ecosystem growing ph accelerate consumption microsoft always organization obviously initially selling cloud downloading direct selling guess lot cloud see mix keep driving ecosystem get bigger better absolutely right strong dna company centric really important cloud particularly think product like azure like end customer wake say want virtual machine database furtherance solution solution come form solution customer develops likely could iv ph si partner implementing notion really cultivating partner ecosystem able better take advantage cloud ph invest important u part reason investing new business model like csp partner program enables partner essentially deliver finished service end building top microsoft cloud service azure also oﬃce 365 dynamic 65 saas vendor point taken model many infrastructure paas vendor taken almost shopping cart pick couple thing dropping drill little advantage approach taking today payouts microsoft q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numotowell two way think one certainly would like engage saas vendor customer right deliver saas perhaps even unbeknownst customer run azure azure inaudible need key engagement model u announced since partnership adobe example bringing marketing cloud document cloud creative cloud saas solution azure important opportunity u time like said apps particularly enterprise live silo data shared application integrate system opportunity u basically provide platform saas application vendor customer use collectively share data think sort best world excellent obviously started purely offering azure expanded adding database technology think add add whether add simply something available virtual machine versus something platform play think certainly striving incredibly feedback driven rather team sit redmond think technology add next actually lot signal get consumption see okay people stuck consumption improve documentation improve better ph sample many point data able collect even documentation know whether know core documentation github anybody community anybody internet basically sort give u feedback hey need thing like need capability like need document done essentially commented get u open way team look say hey actually take feedback either improve documentation include way product presented essentially change capability product q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numotoand think really feedback driven given feel like critical mass footprint community github recently gave u award one biggest contributor code base also contribute code engagement model broader set community really feedback driven think way going drive feedback type loop used need add zyz brand linux nosql database based customer interest absolutely yes totally customer interest constantly monitoring make decision way think want put word mouth ask microsoft think purely consumption model therefore whether consuming someone else consuming microsoft something want chase yes think like said gotten really clear typically around azure consumption prime directive right course like software love people use software cloud kind best case right time going basically clear fact prime directive consumption particularly many customer like really picking two technology already preferred technology saying hey use azure really make sense u basically sort basically try embrace thing people want whether os q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numototechnology language framework operating system standpoint database standpoint humanly possible reason push sql linux certainly one element also saw great opportunity add value frankly capability sql really really great actually deliver set developer write application exploitive capability advanced analytics capability essentially address tam sql okay expands tam sql business given market expansion purely traditional sql database nosql hadoop database rest think think sql opportunity ph traditional market variant part market think sql moving able support nontraditional added capability respect yes well certainly working expand relevance product think lot capability like hadoop added capability sql 2016 called polybase example allows basically write query across relational database data source unified way right get sort unified result back another way continue essentially expand aperture sql useful time also directly embracing lot nosql type technology well thing like dot tv service cloud basically made api dot tv compatible long wave ci ph familiar q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numotolong wave tv actually use dot tv essentially exactly way already familiar using long wave tv example across data technology portfolio broad base technology sql capability like dot tv hd insight essentially managed hadoop service even advanced technology like azure data lake highly differentiated sense fully managed service literally put petabyte object system handle sort charting inaudible query automatically broad portfolio furtherance recruiting application data leveraging azure given breadth depth offering give sense much traditionally five 10 year ago addressable microsoft sold guess many new thing particularly thing exist azure probably would addressable previously net new tam expansion also think go back think azure versus aws sense way really spent lot time thinking microsoft cloud holistically example azure data lake technology originally sort started capability originally built bing term huge data store capable indexing internet technology originally used bing right market expanded people require level capability figured way essentially offer commercial service azure work azure team showing azure team capability showing azure thing like face detection emotion detection similar sense essentially way microsoft company surface investment made place like microsoft research shine lens azure lot capability offer oﬃce 365 essentially engineered azure engineering team show trying q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdlerreally way package monetize product based engineering team work essentially think ﬂexibly regardless engineering team work best place show customer whether oﬃce 365 azure really sort rallying around microsoft cloud whole way running business cloud reach commercial cloud feeding bing window live xbox live everything else appropriate yes course make commercial offering go compliance interpretation inaudible value azure team often commercializing technology right wanted give example way think microsoft cloud really manifestation microsoft engineering capacity showing way make sense customer regardless engineering org okay significantly different saw many year within microsoft think whole notion engineering output customer packaging make sense something increasingly getting better okay speed market term going idea something also improving change development strategy process takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler q unidentified participant q mark moerdler yes mean company year yes time experienced speed delivering new capability fact one thing constantly working keep partner ecosystem seller field partner trained date level new thing coming ferocious rate right could argue good problem something work want make sure product customer representation product reﬂecting latest greatest right okay guess also part value prop get client going premise running either hybrid cloud pure cloud lack better word client going able get much faster capability new improvement et cetera et cetera feedback traditional customer driving acceleration upgrading latest version window server sql server et cetera well certainly intent trying execute excellent question audience yes technical diﬃculty question fortune 500 company running aws decides move azure cost time takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numoto q mark moerdler answer many aspect conversation customer initially switching already done like next workload may already done next project cloud penetration cloud consumption happening rate oftentimes far le switching far next opportunity net new increasingly customer particularly may invested heavily aws definitely looking strategy saying hey want make sure cloud want able manage portfolio sits across different cloud course give u opportunity say hey next project going azure perhaps relook one done first likelihood success focus switch actually focus next workload would imply amount greenfield opportunity massive point compared ability interest taking one cloud vendor another right certainly believe market expansion momentum growth initially come expense okay mean going see mean competitive situation mean competitive bid right always procurement expert every company get earn business sure also time initially always switch required u win right okay much switch q unidentified participant takeshi numoto q mark moerdler takeshi numotoone last question think audience technical diﬃculty yes let explain done term essentially simplifying pricing october really done may come across price reduction really simplification sense historically azure pricing somewhat different based contractual inaudible used buy azure basically seeing lot growth particularly customer may traditionally engaged u may learned lot actually know sort check channel distribution find greatest price maybe startup may relatively unengaged customer microsoft distribution mechanism order make sure simplify pricing model particularly azure reach new audience way already way priced overall visible website simplified website price basically reﬂect offer channel excellent apologize going cut point takeshi thank much really appreciate time effort thank thank much
