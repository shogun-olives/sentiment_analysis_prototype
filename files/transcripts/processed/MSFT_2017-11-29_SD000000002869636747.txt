12 month survey enterprise reaction saw inï¬‚ection point azure saw fiscal q4 result actually showed reacceleration growth attribute reacceleration azure business well think thing one guy sort remember meeting fact remember meeting year ago said look really need double engineering need get working better faster need build service within azure made bet bet think bet paid hear customer azure service much better shape feel much competitive differentiation key category like hybrid think made bet year ago starting pay starting see thing think candidly better selling something came natural u used selling product enterprise agreement environment figure go online product consumption environment took u get sale force feel like sale force figured able articulate value prop better work personally work closely many big deal customer think closer customer value prop service better think add faster growth q michael barry nemeroff david m. q michael barry nemeroff david m. q michael barry nemeroff david m. conversation like largest customer evolved selling cloud azure large enterprise last let say 3 2 one year ago well even think 3 two year ago still people saying need move cloud need happen kind past point customer talk clearly mode need move cloud think point tam expansion acceleration growth market market even bigger might thought lot debate anymore whether move cloud like move cloud think lot fear first customer thought need move environment environment need move cloud think one thing caught hybrid offering saying look need dramatic need pull everything able offer service cloud work together think probably resonating customer shift last 2 three year get get need cloud strategy also get fact need one migrate responsible reasonable way one thing talk investor well question get investor sizing opportunity iaa paas saas environment overall cloud opportunity sound like hybrid approach expansion tam know cloud guy view size market opportunity cloud yes good question resize frequently would say look every six month every year say good news get better think also assumption around microsoft talk hybrid assumption product sort fade away cloud grow question always could grow faster ... cannibalization cannibalization seen window server example seen lot product continue grow also growing cloud q michael barry nemeroff david m. q michael barry nemeroff david m. q michael barry nemeroffbusiness think reï¬‚ects success hybrid strategy people want throw invested lot money invested lot hardware investment want make sure make use look cloud let move stuff let new stuff cloud time get honestly even know time mean like window server business look like 3 five year right feel good window server business continue see decent growth long customer happy long enable work coexist cloud environment think continue customer microsoft best guess workload public cloud today versus still behind firewall think could think look could look like ratio next say five year yes mean know would call microsoft best guess would say number seen like 10 workload cloud would make argument might even optimistic might even yet think still lot opportunity move workload cloud think take place next year two year like next 5 10 year think even 10 year still think still folk running stuff going hybrid environment year come talk large enterprise think hybrid cloud hybrid approach give distinct advantage competitor market yes absolutely think uniquely positioned way vendor go say hey stuff running continue support take care help run well cloud offering person need go company need go support microsoft think lot time people look legacy something might hold back boat anchor see way see legacy great asset customer running product responsibility make sure cloud offering work existing product go nasty transition bailing cloud think company planet array offering talk large customer moving workload cloud demand driver shift cloud david m. q michael barry nemeroff david m. q michael barry nemeroff david m. q michael barry nemeroff david m. talking well one 2 would point think probably pronounced one want left behind want make sure current best technology competitive advantage look get competitive advantage moving cloud look say competitor going want left behind one two every conversation quickly evolves cost conversation guy really cheaper still customer say even cloud offering run cheaper get show number show benefit scale geographic footprint get goodness come along security everything else cloud think understand different stream

barry nemeroff david m. q michael barry nemeroffbasically saying going lose deal based price think global footprint something hard everybody else match data center world anybody business outside u.s. super important well mentioned would match price cut think better matching price cut keeping price little bit higher others market given premium service differentiate microsoft well think combination mean one said hey going get position price see fair somebody offering service offering service underpriced think microsoft always company focused share continue think also getting much better earlier question michael seeing different getting much better explaining innovation adding cloud thing offer u hey going get beat price pay ... compute compute pay customer microsoft price get innovation investing think ultimately market going go priced base innovation opposed low cost came said hey going match price save price conversation get conversation back innovation back best technology feel like mix shift premium service versus compute offset price cut ... yes premium service growing faster core azure expect continue mentioned earlier see legacy product asset interesting durability server product last couple year see continuing evolve see durability continuing server business david m. q michael barry nemeroff david m. q michael barry nemeroffwell yes mean would say continue support server product continue support customer running server product long find useful long getting value right getting lot value go back hybrid story making sure product work cloud even oï¬ƒce using oï¬ƒce example transition oï¬ƒce 365 online version done well still lot room grow stuff take year year transition think important thing customer made big investment want throw investment also want benefit cloud expect u make work together one question get lot investor capex spending spending building data center footprint around world support azure long could support azure look like capex going roughly ï¬‚at year last year investor expect large spending capex build azure last couple year done kind leveling start see improvement margin well would say getting lot question cloud margin think 12 18 month ago term thought cloud margin explained time candid playing aws head start u azure came later catch catching meant build data center footprint u.s. also around globe putting lot building investing lot server spending lot money networking cost catching saying past think much better demand signal largely built global footprint country go largely built addition earlier comment made sat room said need really double engineering piece think driven really good engineering improvement last couple year super smart engineer working stuff gone done thing core code make run eï¬ƒciently cost effectively get server get data center think look capex curve steeper slope playing catch sort start ï¬‚atten seeing benefit scale good engineering driving cost eï¬ƒciencies think continue see benefit engineering investment made continue see investment global expansion made david m. q michael barry nemeroff david m. q michael barry nemeroff david m. q michael barry nemeroffone question get investor around utilization data center comfortable utilization cfo business fill well engineer would say measure utilization 50 different way depends inaudible measure metric look would say well give cfo answer measure cloud gross margin right cloud gross margin improving getting return asset long continue drive improvement cloud gross margin feel like getting decent utilization obviously engineer go look look chokepoint within data center say chokepoint expand counting continued good innovation engineering side drive better utilization data center brieï¬‚y touched gross margin business last quarter first time saw actual margin split commercial cloud implied healthy gross margin azure probably lot higher people believed attribute strength see going time well think continue improve would say think thing state obvious thing impact margin first foremost price think price able achieve market part goal sort neutralizing price conversation think ultimately innovation think continue see engineering benefit even though think engineering team done great work last couple three year still lot opportunity go drive good benefit also think thing always put take thing like building availability zone make sure customer running downtime think investment willing make might swing little bit way would say time continue see good improvement cloud gross margin sure cfo look competitor margin business say okay good better aws margin right david m. q michael barry nemeroff david m. q michael barry nemeroffnow public cloud business reason could match exceed aws margin cloud business yes believe always said scale inï¬‚ection point able able achieve gross margin think microsoft unique position really talk microsoft cloud last quarter reported 5 billion cloud revenue
