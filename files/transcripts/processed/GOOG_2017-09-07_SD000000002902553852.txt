welcome everyone thanks attending citi global technology conference mark mahaney sic mark may internet analyst citi today pleasure welcome alphabet conference diane greene also joining stage today colleague walter pritchard head coverage software sector pleasure welcome diane greene keynote today conference diane really need introduction everyone know diane founded vmware 1999 company acquired 2004 alphabet google fortunate enough able hire diane two year ago help lead effort cloud company really established one leading cloud provider world fairly short period time look forward talking diane key accomplishment last couple year key technology like machine learning analytics really helping win business key client around world conversation customer evolved still fairly nascent growth market diane going kick u introductory slide walter get q session time end take question please prepared although let stick cloud although sure lot question around search advertising want keep conversation cloud diane thanks appreciate great thank hello everybody mic yes great cloud getting exciting minute alphabet board seven year 20 month ago joined google time run cloud still beginning cloud mean cloud originally place startup place surplus capacity sort cost saving thing every business becoming data business cloud people moving cloud secure moving cloud gain competitive advantage google last 20 year 17 year building data center world developing data analytics could argue invented major advance modern big data processing machine learning security also developer environment engineer got 100,000 mile fiber optic cable adding new data center region month past month opened london sydney next week open frankfurt followed sãƒâ£o paulo got run approximately 1/3 world internet traï¬ƒc last three year spent 29 billion capex continuing build keeping enormous growth seeing want start security strongly believe pervasive problem every company data breach expensive think health record 400 health record get breached google information need keep customer data private pioneer feel pretty good security vigilant dedicated security engineer every day would say google engineer kind security engineer built security every layer system proprietary chip like titan say hardware tampered running binary think every layer stack software detects phishing attack mail say someone try gave password someone try use say `` sure person password want change password also developed security firewall protecting everything someone get inside kind trouble look coming call making many many service google service open internet protect much better could firewall take something like chromebook chrome o tiny attack surface updated cloud constantly get ransomware attack something like heartbleed year ago google patched publicly announced also internally developed modern programming environment agile separate layer engineer move quickly developed launched everything run container google launched 2 billion day gmail every service map forth sort 8 active user service brought cloud open sourced kubernetes becoming de facto way run service combine container everything taken care software api management apigee developer move quickly take advantage apis take advantage infrastructure automating everything underneath pretty excited going last month everybody announced support kubernetes active data analytics machine learning take something like bigquery data warehouse spotify moved one competitor 1.5 petabyte think 1.5 billion file got 35x speed using bigquery take something like spanner combined hardware expertise atomic clock every data center make transaction distribute world someone withdrawing either side world wo let overdraft happen example machine learning google machine learning really larry got going right founded company pretty much built data model give share world apis language apis even job api recently announced 30 language example translate natural language video recognition popular finally alan k said serious software going build hardware processor open sourced machine learning tpu google really pushing world openness tpu processor tensorflow google open source active machine learning project github finally support people taught cloud workplace collaboration productivity people increasingly discovering huge transformative effect company collaborate know public company whose board director collaborates google large public company collaborate google doc ask question work ceo thing like search everybody document see working proven amazing suite got 150,000 user verizon moving nielsen 60,000 using hangout time really getting big enterprise customer moved gain agility company collaboration pretty proud massive effort infuse machine learning see thing like smart reply calendar hope quick overview google cloud look forward question one little fun thing mention took q mark alan may diane b. greene q walter h pritchardone big data center building overlaid stanford stadium still see little bit building thing massive exciting area basic data center working customer share google technology see take advantage thank question answer thanks diane google cloud business kind moving faster cloud market overall last couple year wonder could think time far google stage maybe talk key area focus look build maybe know want go first year second year area focus going forward get sense business evolving time sure sure think came mostly focused startup obviously enterprise opportunity least slide deck mean enterprise opportunity going made huge stride really get table stake functionality thing like identity access control networking configuration compliance regulatory got done enterprise customer fully deployed u buildout certainly direct sale force immense number customer engineer google quality customer engineer customer really value set professional service set oï¬ƒce cto customer reliability engineering advance set lot partnering really important thing ecosystem big global strategic partnership people run cloud integrate technically together partner building ecosystem huge priority got done started looking vertical taking machine learning applying vertical taking kubernetes support hybrid lift shift bought apigee facilitate api management would say big milestone gotten top google drive gotten top quadrant gartner forrester named u leader paas clearly came basically every customer partner discussion google really serious enterprise heard month diane obviously run large enterprise software company past think probably know well take presence perspective able compete couple competitor space obviously microsoft ten thousand sale marketing professional virtue legacy market diane b. greene q walter h pritchard diane b. greene q mark alan may diane b. greene running vmware ... right exactly right amazon building feel like kind great limiting step google cloud growth factor look going forward guess want focus particular much limiter want next several year yes well definitely environment working hard kind hand deck turn anybody away work exciting u building leverage build training certification train partner certify partner started announced deep strategic partner sap going give u lot leverage sap google pretty excited partnership also advanced data trustee thing see partnering announcement recently announced nutanix hybrid support many foot street growing rapidly recently brought seasoned sale executive run billion revenue somewhere else continue buildout really focused partner making successful mentioned sap g suite set application market leader paas competitive side sort moving stack partnering sap apps think long term term mix business google want cloud importance saas well g suite strategic u thing like bigquery sheet drive great place put file getting greater time machine learning gmail well 1 billion user pretty commonplace g suite communication mechanism go cloud storage individualized storage team storage saas vendor partnering announced huge win marketo big deal example kind partner going saas vendor run google cloud take advantage want work every saas vendor think huge advantage cloud every time one move go oh fantastic talk thing improved advantage sap stack mean sap well hana run google cloud sap running q mark alan may diane b. greene q mark alan may diane b. greene q walter h pritchard diane b. greeneon google cloud integrating g suite working machine learning people know data trustee relationship announce reiterate time data center supplier running germany running data center running workload german company data united state company key milestone u interesting hybrid brought kubernetes think maybe two year ago lot standard one definitely gelled leading container manager container orchestrator see google product market leverage kubernetes vendor sort hybrid google offering hybrid seem like also parallel hybrid cloud got enterprise large data center large data center everybody see advantage built getting sort mixing diï¬ƒcult hybrid strategy potentially kubernetes big part look like well want kubernetes run extremely well run extremely well every cloud pretty certain going run best cloud mean invented developed announce partnership around hybrid nutanix solution built solution customer running kubernetes cloud would say stay tuned lot come okay taking also new development take next level open source maybe question machine learning talk important winning business today example provide actually used enterprise customer today sure yes machine learning one major disruption going get always cite google carbon neutral data center set data center world always prioritized optimized data center energy usage much humanly possible applied machine learning cooling got 40 advantage human getting 2 3 40 advantage machine q mark alan may diane b. greene q mark alan may diane b. greene q walter h pritchardlearning kind amazing working basically every customer machine learning even bring advance system lab work public customer talk like airbus use vision build model take cloud image something never able 20 year ocado biggest online retailer u.k. based u.k. able use machine learning detect customer sentiment know handle call call center familymart japan use huge chain neighborhood grocer stock 3 time day using analytics machine learning figure stock thing predict lot might imagine ca talk sure earlier day cloud think still get airplay price reduction focus everybody market reducing price lot google actually sort headline making price reduction couple year ago talk impact price reduction market drive strategy around pricing especially infrastructure service kind service offering question pricing putting word mouth saying service commodity well saying seen price reduction think agree maybe basic compute storage service around longest mature one seen greatest price reduction wondering view maybe price elasticity demand market drive strategy around pricing versus competitor may one thing pioneer model pricing customer look total cost end quite bit le expensive partly charge minute partly give automatic price reduction use require reserved instance partly great performance forget name group cloudharmony something like published study showed u 1 performing cloud service low total cost becoming company biggest cost item company care get big deal lot work everybody sort got custom lot work go contract large team people u lot go develop proposal customer diane b. greene q walter h pritchard diane b. greene q mark alan may diane b. greene q mark alan may q unidentified participant diane b. greene q unidentified participanti guess along line given transparent segmented pricing many customer actually sort rate card versus contractual pricing varies dramatically well certainly big online business right maybe people get bigger bigger might come back discus optimize top fortune 5000 google cloud get together talk snap formerly snapchat get together talk going run much going know ahead time load going spiky going work customer outsider translate see kind public rate type price change immediate ï¬‚ow customer contractual term see immediate benefit customer reported ... yes well mean certainly yes honor price matter yes sure could microphone think audience wanted definitely give inaudible yes would love question opportunity saw hand yes got right guess walter asked enterprise sale force said partnering nutanix someone else guess sap yes sap guess ... diane b. greene q unidentified participant diane b. greene q mark alan may q unidentified participant diane b. greene partner salesforce box partner coming think everyone recognizes amount money guy spent guy leader technology walter point point need upgrade enterprise sale force let say two year road google cloud kind still maintaining current trajectory walter probably walter mark ask question need traditional enterprise sale force ... well think cloud hiring incredibly aggressively alphabet investing cloud sort saying `` oh done sale force googlely building serious enterprise sale force would argue cloud demand different approach think going company move cloud something run building assembling almost application putting container kind everything else going need partner need salesperson drive contract sort project manage also want lot technical people involved customer need take advantage data analytics machine learning transform agile development migrate thing building serious enterprise people think really way translate become extraordinarily everybody google cloud focused customer talk every partner every single day share lot information going customer partner driving business slas track carefully would say getting pretty people one advantage many advantage google cloud one advantage see really trouble hiring people really like come google helpful think question towards middle diane good job describing lot ip developed inside google last 5 10 year kubernetes example think commercial software would probably worth entire enterprise value vmware peak q unidentified participant diane b. greene q mark alan may diane b. greene q unidentified participant diane b. greeneye sometimes say 80 product yes describe decision open source software ip rather monetize internally go decision kind monetization opportunity open source ip created somewhat principled approach feel benefit far greater run everywhere open sourced take kubernetes driven creating customer value really kubernetes available everybody run anywhere really amplifies value kubernetes feel know better anybody else advantage tensorflow way want build ecosystem wanted get huge community continue accentuating advantage running cloud want make available everywhere wherever something open advantage get hugely amplified available everywhere open source ... think game trying lock people cloud see great customer decision advantage think google cloud become apparent open seeing customer find pretty appealing go ahead sorry talk little bit decision build hardware machine learning kind see future use case better run tpus versus gpus well first let really clear lot gpus google cloud work well nvidia tpu google immense amount machine learning internally well externally big data machine learning training using model saw opportunity build custom chip would give order magnitude performance advantage actually save u lot money also let u better job machine learning could turn thing around quickly natural put cloud user really exciting thing google cloud vehicle take google really ongoing technical innovation share world every company every geography every size q mark alan may q unidentified participant diane b. greene q mark alan may diane b. greene q walter h pritchardpretty exciting natural thing share tpus also take advantage innovation coming nvidia well maybe time one go ahead inaudible yes two quick question one would compare experience vmware versus google cloud vmware leading front look like coming behind second think need make acquisition accelerate enterprise adoption yes compare ahead vmware behind number customer would say behind every category mean actually similarity think came virtualization vmware nobody ran best way run system people see value lot operating system running native every machine behind certain way got people realized value definitely ahead think could say thing going google technology going really automate thing people give competitive advantage ongoing basis behind term people saying `` okay going although never seen one thing different vmware pace never seen pace vmware pretty rapid growth 11 year 2 billion revenue similar kind startup feel google cloud although immense resource immense technology people got replicable customer deployment go across board every single vertical pretty optimistic guess sort think competition bad thing certain way competition running old way well ... think second question acquisition inaudible acquisition yes definitely acquiring lot fairly small biggest acquisition apigee worked really well api management big big deal modern enterprise company work across customer partner constantly lookout size acquisition constantly revisiting strategy acquire find way make help u accelerate thing yes diane b. greene q mark alan mayi think come end allotted time like thank diane team alphabet okay well thank much okay real treat thank diane
