integrating number google technology advance cloud deliver industry solution foundation google data center infrastructure even today google transmits transfer 25 internet traï¬ƒc world data center network allows u share capability building power google property also cost point view give u material cost advantage relative cloud provider able distribute workload way cloud provider let look solution infrastructure modernization historically heard google support sort workload within organization thing like called lift shift take legacy workload move cloud offer disaster allow run sap instance cloud older view google technology today support major type workload customer want provide number solution whether disaster recovery archival et cetera customer use include cardinal health moved huge part supply chain infrastructure google cloud air asia one airline asia using u transform department health care field broad institute us u manage genomics data data science infrastructure second one key capability customer want move workload cloud manage vast quantity data scale broad brush involves 3 type infrastructure either allow migrate existing database cloud called hosting allow deploy new workload cloud build new application cloud allow take existing database migrate new infrastructure cloud support 3 capability support capability transaction processing analytic processing well specialized data source understand infrastructure requirement google technology analytic processing solution called bigquery used many leading company world handle data warehouse scale handle multiple petabyte single warehouse amazing performance scale scale compute storage independently one another query processing second guaranteed response time query example google technology advantage managing data scale enables company like metro group one largest retailer europe well home depot run commerce estate cloud build application allow customer use variety different tool well technology stack including thing like openshare pivotal cloud foundry forth heart trying eliminate burden developer operator manage source technology manage infrastructure making fully managed infrastructure

customer legacy application migration hsbc building set application regulatory reporting various purpose managing information getting information data essential problem lot organization want u solve move digital world 2 broad capability offer first one capability around artificial intelligence look sky television collecting data stream million device want take data stream coming process identify pattern human behavior coming data stream google technology artificial intelligence allows take raw data stream convert information allows personalize experience user time also traditional analytic processing technology thing like data information service combined 2 offering offer customer enormous advantage example people example telegraph large publication united kingdom moved another cloud provider u entire estate advance offer analytics ai lastly area productivity many many year people focused productivity professional worker 1 billion professional people earth people work corporate oï¬ƒces 2 frontline worker worker people like pilot field service technician person come repair television person retail store productivity collaboration solution meet need people corporate oï¬ƒces

workload cloud estate cloud people worried 2 thing risk capability risk 2 biggest risk worried availability security availability point view public statistic available show 1/10 downtime every cloud provider word 10x reliable number two vastly secure google advance security around protecting infrastructure protecting data customer protecting user also giving transparency important customer like scotiabank target use u infrastructure provider second lot organization want build application deployed 2 different way one called hybrid cloud want cloud run inside data center reason want latency reason want something close system example mainframe could regulatory reason could national jurisdiction time many company also want support called ability write application deploy multiple cloud provider technology called google cloud service platform run inside customer data center google cloud well cloud provider allowing customer write application without change able deploy environment give u material difference capability compared cloud provider importantly offer customer extraordinary choice deploy application workload separate need choosing deploy time write application important customer like hsbc airbus frankly important factor almost every fortune 500 cio next want make easy people adopt cloud customer like bloomberg bnp paribas choose u take away burden customer operate either infrastructure database application platform analytic tool want focus building application getting information data take care managing infrastructure thereby reducing cost burden improving speed ease adopt cloud probably familiar google advance ai machine learning material capability vastly differentiated provider market whether raw infrastructure thing like tensor processing hardware tensorflow dominant machine learning algorithm framework market also moved stack computer vision understanding image document video applying arrive different solution many many company beginning adopt whether pharmaceutical industry identify pattern drug genetics whether entertainment business example like lg using look different piece information manufacturing shop ï¬‚oor also taken technology integrating capability google example klm domino pizza put together ai framework called cloud dialogï¬‚ow digital assistant talk 28 language oï¬ „ oad contact center improves experience somebody

research average data center today world look power consumed computer data center power go data center typically 3.2x amount power consumed data center go data center power network mean almost 2.2x power lost wasted lot money google publicly published data center run need 1 megawatt power data center need 10 enormous work gone great discipline optimize use power data center design data center recently advance talked using ai optimize machine consume power load balance power consumption example look google data center consume lot power look spend spent enormous time optimizing even grow business invest growth paying extraordinary attention making sure competitive think one right thomas thanks highlighting kind differentiation peer want get thought term look kind amazon microsoft obviously seeing amazon kind move stack infrastructure adding path side also database also seeing microsoft kind mean historically strong productivity apps also going stack infrastructure side would love hear thought term player moving order address need customer strong differentiation infrastructure side would love hear broadly speaking think term stack gcp continue add improve order able address need holistic level customer thomas kurian q heather anne bellini thomas kurian q heather anne bellini number solution stack infrastructure platform example building industry health solution health care company called google cloudhealth provides using ai ability extract information medical health record solution contact center service targeted complement existing contact center oï¬ „ oad cost people adopted number industry solution marketing top base platform already number solution base infrastructure platform targeted specific industry see u continue expand footprint well right think time thank thomas much thank appreciate
