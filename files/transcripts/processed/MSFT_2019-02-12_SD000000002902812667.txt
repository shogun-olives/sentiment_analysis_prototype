right yes exactly ready go thank everybody thank coming today really want thank microsoft team coming may watching weather seattle gotten hit ton snow last week know herculean effort get want thank julia white coming corporate vice president azure marketing u always great session really appreciate taking time absolutely yes question answer guess thing get asked lot kind transition go back year ago five year ago people would thought 100 workload well everyone always optimistic would public cloud depending stats look far market growing aggressively think transition yes couple different angle mic yes hear couple different angle would say well general cloud adoption great definitely growing moving even kind adopter percentage ip application built migrated go cloud still pretty small still lot go company today workload migrating cloud q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellinibuilding new cloud still majority running think couple thing changed definitely moved seeing kind early adopter moving cloud getting kind first workload cloud even adopter think kind cycle customer type definitely pushed even farther interestingly past year conversation really basic cloud conversation next wave adopter started come front right think workload azure moved first guess think cohort like mentioned right early adopter putting azure today year ago see uptake technology kind migration changing people able learn cohort yes type adopter yes see overall tam azure public cloud right 2 thing one application exist today migrate cloud net new application built migration innovation 2 basic way go back early early cloud adopter innovation like net new thing lot actually early azure workload came new mobile app new system built moved wave like `` actually get cloud really going start migrating existing set business area say went back three year migration workload looked like backup disaster recovery system migration pipe good innovation pipe kind normalized kind type tranche workload within migration seeing thing like sap huge pipeline like system running azure obviously microsoft running sap system azure proof point definitely moved kind tier 2 type workload migration tier 1 think front balance innovation kind workload application migration normalized tell thing kind shaping whole market level sophistication migrated also increased still early mean know extent guy kind talk give u way think kind going path like iaa versus paas penetration azure meaning azure workload julia white q heather anne bellini julia whiteright percentage would revenue much would paas versus iaa like think like moving higher way think would encourage others think think workload application customer using right straight migration going use core infrastructure right even like couple year ago people would say `` going migrate leave alone actually meet customer talk like anymore walmart great example started migrating like `` anymore modernize everything bringing see eﬃciencies get say modernization mean mean using core infrastructure using thing like developer service data service managed service get greater eﬃciencies cloud well taking advantage talk service built beginning incredible scale supereﬃcient great user experience say overall pipeline still lot people migrating infrastructure almost immediately modernization work happens platform service data service start getting consumed mean involved business quite time take look kind marketing message would help team create looking competitor kind going pro con competitive differentiation look like today feel competing strength weakness talk yes thing talk also hear back customer u talking first think hybrid long time huge differentiator belief compute distributed public cloud distributed well true talk hybrid data center cloud even move intelligent edge distributed compute building consistency around area certainly talk next one would overall talk productivity point view came heritage know customer varied range technology skill set technology team built management tool built developer tool built policy people moving cloud learn tooling system productivity message certainly resonates last one actually really increasing around trust trust security compliance privacy accreditation attestation mean public cloud certainly important pivoted even farther trusted vendor transparent core competency business going turn around compete customer q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne belliniobviously big theme hear market well term overall trusting microsoft partner right amy talked lot earnings call enterprise mobility included obviously azure line strength business kind think maybe saas application running top think type saas application reason care typically higher gross margin right think kind expand touch point within azure saas touch point within azure yes enterprise mobility em set azure service sell sapplications right protect user device apps kind package really actually go market microsoft 365 great opportunity area mean honestly data service really think follow class kind service part azure business incredibly healthy see ton opportunity class service customer moving cloud one biggest problem trying solve around data estate operational data also analytical data particularly everyone ai strategy everybody like `` got use ai got create ai application system `` get always like dream ai go `` look data analytics system old rigid ... ai without data right quickly pivot like `` oh gosh got work analytics data warehousing data lake part cloud growth phenomenal going go going build ai going build data estate analytics system make sense part think higher level service right probably hear much one earnings call would seem like would one come term technical diﬃculty little le em maybe given well guy done bit area julia white q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini yes mean think overall growth em 94 million paid user like huge business phenomenal love point slow scale data service area azure still putting number really big business right question come lot interested perspective investor consternation every quarter whether azure growth whether 74 76 like lot market cap trade small difference percentage know amy reminds time sure say people fixate specific number well important number bad one pay attention going pay attention keep perspective right mean azure massive business way report also inclusive em part business well per user graduating growth aspect well unpack behind number incredible growth within seen data service like growth huge huge new industry going yes business size going see growth moderate always feel bad internal review high expectation amy high expectation u say beating business business growing 100 like `` god happen try keep problem yes like went business school one taught grow business 100 yet within dynamic feel good couple thing one new business entering whether analytics going see next quarter additional place investing new business crashing mean effectively got unlimited tam playing majority azure right em cap iaa paas perspective ... julia white q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia whitevery unlimited operationalizing well capitalizing well yes see growth continue stabilize really high number though internal benchmarking azure performance like know like determine okay make amy happy certain benchmark look aws growth rate kind grading segment yes obviously triangulation different area certainly looking vendor growing rate time life cycle certainly one way look looking size shape existing equivalency would fast moving see early signal term ai going true type data adoption need happening working back see market signal perspective looking 3 little bit arc obviously kind unlimited tam type business every time think put aggressive number amy kind push u little harder job keep trying one question started come last month guess idea salesperson getting paid presell capacity getting paid quota presell capacity might kind area expertise kind think changed always told process getting paid right changed year ago like salesperson focused consumption share u kind changed potentially compensation strategy changed yes journey took sale force paid billed revenue selling microsoft expired license azure commits purely paid consumption kind graduated three year 100 based consumption microsoft salesperson paid azure consumed revenue customer chooses say `` hi want give 1 million upfront use next year salesperson see 1 million quota see get consumed year 100 true company still obviously financially recognize customer chooses bill upfront interesting pulled done much field retraining go build motion get rid muscle memory go consumption actually found customer like q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia white actually kind like buy lock dollar yes actually customer technical diﬃculty feeling course take money way salesperson front line actually recognized also incentivize compensate partner channel either also consumed revenue right okay wanted spend little bit time azure hybrid benefit seems like mean guy uniquely positioned offer license movement talk u really started make way market feedback start see customer moment said `` okay great yes context azure hybrid benefit window server sql server customer hybrid benefit microsoft azure hybrid benefit allows basically run window sql window server sql server azure repurchase ip fantastic advantage kind give customer buyer window sql kind insurance plan people know want go cloud next generation obviously give azure wonderful price advantage term able run ip already bought like ... go effect going say think second year oﬃcially program landed took couple mostly 18 12 month ago really saw adoption craze awareness get people buy also operationalized product azure go deploy virtual machine say `` hi azure hybrid benefit also made really frictionless customer take advantage seeing huge benefit licensing benefit add customer also pipeline window sql application migrating azure fantastic mean aspect azure hybrid benefit also window sql server 2008 product going extended support 10 year old mean going mainstream support customer faced 2 option one buy extended security update 75 cost license move run azure get free secondary q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia whitebenefit 2008 installed base largest installed base space right right pay per year stay stay saying want paying update 75 inaudible three year three year something get customer agreement yes okay okay yes pretty road general like good good catalyst anytime actually different happening sap right everyone sap move hana 2025 huge catalyst people saying `` okay got touch sap system going move hana going move cloud see phenomenal pipeline around sap system moving azure think catalyst 2008 extended support support security update another one 2 big big growth opportunity business feel like talk specifically aws feel closed functionality gap relative year think way mean customer say reﬂected customer partner conversation part think people say equal right analyst customer interesting thing customer go like `` oh missing feature know going soon enough `` aws missing feature probably get pretty normalized pure technology perspective place materially different come hybrid category thing bunch stuff ca touch aspect like pretty normalized perspective aws obviously first q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia whiteleader get benefit doubt leading oﬃce 365 business luxury know like hunt little harder azure side see trust factor come lot think one intangible partner partner meeting morning like `` hi used work aws worry competing ... come lot real concern right think proud work done transparent plan core competency know 40 year build trust know look like used good bit window revenue run window workload running aws like happens going forward mean maybe became strong guy trend window workload running aws find way kind shift workload back azure say number obviously see mine pipeline ... must send check right well yes certain boundary ... yes yes okay amy know would say would shocked pipeline window sql better despite bigger obviously think phenomenal growth differentiated opportunity front taking application cloud another one honestly place could spend lot time competitive nature would want u like white space tam business big actually encourage salesperson focus lot energy customer like `` hi ca trust aws `` find better business say switch q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini q unidentified participant julia whitenot necessarily place actively hunting trying go pull mean aspect aws world think expected look today heterogeneous think cloud different see people making different decision `` hi going new innovation type cloud going migration cloud really customer mindset part department application application best breed want kind spread estate across different vendor vendor control vendor concern lot different thing even though customer might window sql application aws mean going put next one azure blended expect continue true take aws outpost yes come little heartening funny watch would even say word hybrid like would literally say word like `` weird guess cloud hammer hit nail would talk hybrid five year azure stack market two year right finally utter word hybrid outpost even laugh little bit name like outpost like serious sound like something way named even tell really feel think interesting azure stack people trying compare first market think year definitely different azure stack full kind integrated cloud system run locally see look like kind platform layer service able run existing infrastructure kind managed way see turn think kind like welcome welcome reality customer hybrid need hybrid interesting see play different try fact hybrid offering versus build beginning identity data management hybrid ... want see question audience oh one think mic runner hold right think perception guy strong enterprise many thing talked hybrid reliability trust positioning younger company relevant next generation company q heather anne bellini q unidentified participant julia white q unidentified participant julia whiteyes looked starting let say segmentation perspective look azure business actually equally distributed across small business kind midsize enterprise large enterprise consumed revenue perspective maybe balanced people might think obviously strong enterprise overall healthy small business well feel great feel great execution growth rate actually think really strong smb kind web direct business superstrong specific question couple different initiative targeted reactor kind center around world also investment program provide money resource actually thing reach work u go market come work u technology running azure earn right able sale force huge lever obviously earn way level idea could suddenly sold 50,000 microsoft salesperson across globe pretty impressive seeing lot strong demand specifically go back couple year ago u aws gcp throwing bunch credit think mostly burning money would move one program next program use credit leave much focused program specifically feel good pipeline obviously b2b love u b2c quite much global sale force necessarily focused okay question one back sort detected bit pickup management whenever would talk fact microsoft offer solution compete customer heather asked essentially said go salesperson go chase kind customer missing something hear well one time guess trying ask detected pickup tone management recently microsoft competing customer see throughout amazon competing customer whereas said really chase customer per se amazon may competing bit mismatch wondering missing tell seeing see answer question perhaps would say thing like retailer financial service company health q unidentified participant julia white q unidentified participant julia whitecare seeing amazon go business saying `` gosh going give money people competing money actually deeper issue data right running system cloud sense data information coming information probably want share someone competing space think thing see come often seeing like kroger walgreens boot gap lot company moving actively azure distance basically feeding competition maybe know answer question ... mentioned diﬃculties converting ai strategy reality wondering seeing takeup ai compute offering actually everyone wanted say going use actually reality quite strong thought yes mean think lot technology height cycle right everyone got excited ai still excited look executive briefing center ai 1 conversation customer want come u tell index people said `` great want ai like `` okay well 2 thing ai model ai model prebuilt like prebuild data resource like computer vision detect shoe versus water bottle use ai model application lot seen lot adoption prebuilt model building application take advantage ai model sophisticated `` going build ai model power supply chain predict customer behavior need get data science going using specialized compute able process run kind algorithm high fidelity much complicated conversation tends start dream data scientist quite know want yet tends much analytics getting data science basic taking advantage compute available kind 2 class prebuilt ai model use building capability around plan end capacity wider question plan capacity yes say seeing strong growth yes lot science combination first globally see demand signal obviously lot lot model around predict demand going coming also good visibility sale pipeline direct field also q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia whitefrom partner type application type workload people coming like sap certain type compute know need pretty good sense need distributed ai one still early little harder predict one probably perfect capacity utilization one early big part ﬂeet either kind specialized compute like wildly make lot difference margin one little bit harder wanted ask container adoption interest serverless customer saying yes kind service basically simple way 2 class data service kind developer platform service container serverless talk developer system back application migrate migrate first thing modernize move container like world chosen kubernetes containerization using technology called kubernetes go kubernetes conference selling mainstream average company like gone elite tech everybody choice absolutely next wave core every modernization project seen expect continue internally think real trend serverless lot confusion around serverless really mean people started talking kind thing like hey action happens outcome make another action inaudible serverless basically paas work right talk serverless really say paas anymore like anything require manage compute working storage underneath come play modernization net new innovation application think strong trend side thing become deﬂationary extent went cloud 4 five year ago deploying paas buying reserved instance example period might using wanted make sure always available move serverless use need right think deﬂationary aspect could cause someone iaa paas infrastructure right versus kind much could ignite even spending right additive create new use case new application yes think would theoretically say `` gosh going deﬂationary everything going shift going get supereﬃcient q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia whitehow use see reality moving quite like look classify data developer service data service growing incredibly hot shift core infrastructure running going make data even kind deﬂationary developer high level right collective basis net increase spending depends allocating right way yes think gotten sophisticated serverless mean technology different type right thing like supereﬃcient customer perspective low cost awesome hard run system technology really hard like really know build app totally make work many people planet really want theoretically possible versus think actually going happen look little differently much balanced approach people people use technology question saw standing question okay saw mic runner sorry thomas kurian ceo google cloud earlier morning wondering competitive analysis hearing feedback customer gcp fit equation yes like outside see say almost every conversation customer partner aws azure expect every meeting every discussion see gcp occasionally mostly show like france conversation tend come reﬂecting think anything else ... yes microsoft view customer telling yes see reality come could different way maybe cmo adwords g suite kind buy gcp usage kind roundabout way get account business think early trying get enterprise win going go business see come frequent honest geography see place q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini julia white q heather anne bellini okay last question github role see github playing expanding developer audience think github fit yes microsoft level right term incredible developer resource ten million developer hundred million repository wonderful ecosystem term microsoft developer relevancy wonderful asset continue run independently like seen u linkedin minecraft independent capability autonomy really important deeply understand value yet also see opportunity help customer example put offer together allows enterprise customer buy github enterprise microsoft licensing big promotion kind put see incredible adoption like customer begging github enterprise offering really done enterprise way way microsoft right customer hungry pretty simple thing got easier like `` great one thing see great customer benefit natural aﬃnity wonderful opportunity together good jamming hazard anything nature right great thank julia yes appreciate thanks everybody thank
