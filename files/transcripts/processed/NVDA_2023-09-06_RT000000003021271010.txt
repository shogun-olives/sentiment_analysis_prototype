good morning welcome evercore isi semi semi equipment conference matthew prisco semiconductor analyst morning pleasure welcoming colette kress cfo nvidia accompanying valuable discussion believe colette celebrating 10th anniversary nvidia cfo month period nvidia seen modest gain transitioned pc unit play eye many accelerated compute powerhouse today welcome colette thank joining u congratulation hugely successful journey thank question answer question answer format chat number question run save time end audience q start two main colette kress q matthew prisco colette kressbuckets fielding question today around data center sustainability supply kicking sustainability side particularly data center revenue 3q position tripled 1q level would love hear thought driving confidence sequential growth maybe close working customer infrastructure strategy thinking potential demand data center gpus today okay thanks u make opening statement sure say reminder presentation contains statement investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business okay let first talk thing regarding demand sustainability demand term seeing strong visibility well strong interest term product lot stemmed opening openai chatgpt holiday increasingly interesting time related people really started understand simplicity using ai many enterprise whether think monetization standpoint new product could whether see ai term eﬃciency everything demand seeing requires u spend quite bit time planning many customer customer see today customer also sometimes decade working work term inside data center think important opening statement say supplying chip look data center computing company helping create data center future data center future talked associated ai important killer app see really along accelerated computing think take consistently see future growth see really looking improve eﬃciency data center working sustainability data center use energy also really allowing work able accomplish without accelerated computing yes working many company helping term data center build helping term planning look term solution large language model right using product help building large language model q matthew prisco colette kress q matthew priscofuture see inferencing related model built keep mind couple different use case also see use recommendator engine use many form extracting substantial amount data using data accelerate computing well thing seeing across customer perfect foundational model clearly focus area today think number model need built long could drive training demand maybe initial model built training focus shift towards iteration specific application model maintenance adjusting drift whatnot enough training demand fully utilize current seeing discussion foundational model come one two three different foundational model created created different country different region world well specific area one type model see see additional model often related specifically company company may look two different type well internally using data information help fuel inside company also help customer term call center building model answer type call foundational model important part training continue see model built otherwise architecture built term lot system bring market today associated capability training moving inferencing stage training process extremely helped eﬃciencies data center dual use see build model work term inferencing may even come back make adjustment model time continue build leaf great infrastructure best training also sizable inferencing market future well think see inferencing related massive amount data may consumer internet company use see company microsoft considering use inferencing platform help also see gcp example looking offering well inferencing training important go forward okay 2023 seemingly year training build build come extreme compute requirement lofty asp model begin increasingly move production mix skews towards inference side think impact nvidia risk pressure colette kress q matthew prisco colette kressthe fall asp type digestion period customer kind take training build leverage infrastructure think work done training lot spent time thinking size model thinking parameter would necessary type training determined amount interested term purchasing position helping company even form ai accelerated computing really tco saving realize nothing better infrastructure save money save energy work determined pricing pricing look say value help save single chip data center whole saving pas part work done pricing use reinvestment back company set price set price beginning relatively keep price throughout ownership selling two different architecture see going forward although position ai looking generative ai important piece right probably important inﬂection people understanding need focus 1 trillion installed base x86 cpu type infrastructure time think make even eﬃcient think moving installed base accelerated computing necessarily generative ai different form computing happen likely see transition move generative ai moving accelerated computing long term well benefit thinking purchasing move towards accelerated computing ownership data center total make sense moving proliferation large language model seeing split customer creating model scratch versus leveraging foundational model meet need maybe different scenario impact nvidia differently yeah foundational model using infrastructure many large company build foundational model one foundational model upgrade foundational model time thing enterprise company building different model continue support well may supported many different factor one thing helpful model model either available and/or thing nemo bionemo help term optimizing model well q matthew prisco colette kress q matthew prisco colette kresswe software service continue support many company build model receive request time model great shape working 80 help u term optimize nvidia key infrastructure need also software support perfect thinking inference market particular majority today processed cpu model move production think gpu opportunity maybe put differently think percentage new best supported gpus kind driving view look infrastructure little bit diﬃcult u differentiate determine exact amount time spent training inferencing however believe inferencing large market likely larger long term term seeing continue selling system also specific system leveraged specifically inferencing important piece folk looking thinking cost every step inferencing platform cost course going important also sustainability energy lowest form energy use move inferencing position platform help term think continue driver inferencing inferencing become extremely complex time inferencing year ago using cpu work rather binary type decision inferencing today complex model inferencing latency required lot time end use important piece gpus perfectly set help right clear like move supply major area fielding question maybe help u understand disconnect approach many taking correlating cost capacity growth nvidia gpu shipment growth capability obviously correlation holding currently missed maybe help u better understand thinking supply backdrop potential expansion highlighted earnings plan supply continued ramp supply quarter moving forward even go fiscal year working across board different supplier help improve supply position support many customer demand put front u mean looking lot different thing adding additional q matthew prisco colette kress q matthew prisco colette kresssuppliers adding additional capacity qualifying also looking term time spent improving cycle time whole across supply chain thing worked colos important piece term putting together form packaging really lot type chip type thing keep mind multiple supplier add colos improve overall size supply done see part ramp bring supplier okay mentioned development qualification new supplier key step manufacturing process first add maybe color nvidia involvement investment developing supply chain second build supplier base think qualification process mitigate maybe quality concern utilization le mature source okay first starting partnership supplier many partner u 30 year company well even multiple decade partnership important try continue treat supplier best case may going faster supplier helping work together term improve supply scenario work look think supply may look inventory reality looking purchase commitment well sometimes prepaids helping supplier quickly bring capacity quickly bring supply going thing get understanding long term purchase commitment capacity agreement helpful continue move forward going forward taking folk need qualified additional help term bringing process work together right quality standpoint supplier new supplier serving part business serving different customer feel good type customer see supply chain quality really issue right u perfect think potential supply limitation causing heavier mix hopper overall would expected maybe could offer color stand hopper adoption curve today compare prior cycle think moving forward q matthew prisco colette kress q matthew priscoso hopper hopper current generation architecture data center market probably close year something launched last fall keep mind even launched last fall something continued improve relationship customer knowing coming helping qualify helping really understand engineering behind equally adopted quickly see lot product hopper important architecture continue see u time using hopper interesting something always seen well prior architecture often sold time selling hopper ampere ampere architecture also second best architecture market sold well many people already qualified ampere still qualifying hopper great opportunity add additional ampere project may move second stage project changing architecture may ideal continuing ampere even second quarter sold volume standpoint equal ampere hopper know see hopper continue ramp even see next couple quarter right perfect prior data center revenue explosion past two quarter guy highlighted vision acceleration attach roughly single digit growing 100 next 10 year given recent uptick thinking stand today journey 100 look like maybe color could offer term workload transition timing potential milestone anything would helpful yes statement making looking single digit percent currently within data center data center across world look full view term understanding modern data center right quite disaggregated goal percentage data center whole necessarily counting server counting individual type chip think right way look thing data center perspective right vision focus accelerated computing within data center important piece movement generative ai easy understanding really inﬂuenced folk looking accelerated computing key ai application also term long term say conserving energy finding way densify work really important tco value journey fast get 100 going really really hard determine powerful inﬂection point u continue even past generative ai move accelerated computing colette kress q matthew prisco colette kressand path 100 data center accelerated limiter thinking full data center system could pressure slope adoption curve whether hardware software ecosystem step taken kind push front important piece understand think u data center computing company provide sure gpu system important keep mind also ability adopt cpu help overall acceleration process acquisition mellanox use networking really understand importance networking many high volume system amount traﬃc come inside data center unique focusing network acceleration important step back look moment data probably entered data center accelerate work networking nvlink cpu gpus importantly software development platform stack help way application key term adoption accelerated computing without help working important time get application using accelerated computing work think full platform inﬂuencing ease adoption ease moving accelerated computing faster anything seen okay envision world full acceleration thinking split gpus asics potential accelerator maybe percent total compute best served gpus area potentially remain better suited alternative tough determine success custom asic different type accelerator think important understand data center acceleration sure form accelerated chip lot different type accelerator accomplishing work actually diﬃcult determine size success world thing moving quite quickly changing quite quickly almost type application going forward form ai ai still early journey customizing specific asic hard coding specific asic make diﬃcult thing moving fast beneficial probably take several year accomplish custom asic others may specific workload size static type workload could see customizing form accelerator something always existed possibly small different type option focus get adoption platform q matthew prisco colette kress q matthew prisco colette kressall different part platform give customer much choice possible think build future okay clearly multiyear investment cycle lot spend going accelerated compute platform think attach rate growing even 20 amount gpu spend becomes quite significant thinking growth case justify level investment think strong enough pull customer continue pay additional ai functionality seeing today something simple generative ai lot different piece really explaining enterprise simplicity using ai many different form ai improve business long term see application move accelerated and/or incorporate ai journey begun part u probably half decade well see consumer internet company see large cloud company also working term recommendator engine working moving significant amount inferencing work site search cam ad thing need marketing product key accelerated computing using ai beginning work right term software help support many individual industry seen right many enterprise turning u help software service provide helping rebuild model rebuild supporting customer well something say hey window today really whole journey going forward see increase right like move software side little bit announcement software offering partnership including vmware hugging face servicenow positive view support solidifying nvidia moat reach said quantification software revenue really changed much past 18 month driving apparent disconnect goodness hearing software side actual ﬂow p l thinking software growth trajectory yes let talk much version software help many different enterprise help customer using platform keep mind lot software embedded system provide customer onset ability full development platform full optimization platform embedded system extremely helpful q matthew prisco colette kress q matthew priscocorrect also sell separately important piece enterprise enterprise turn towards ai accelerated computing somebody running software keeping current keeping security important risk factor enterprise want see want purchase seen already term announcement second announcement vmware continuing work platform well enterprise vmware connected vmware visible inside enterprise data center key overall software selling separately selling separately likely reach near 1 billion year scaling scaling quickly key nvidia ai enterprise key part also omniverse platform long term also going see autonomous driving key factor software revenue well great maybe nvidia ai enterprise moment company made decision directly package solution h100 system recognizing baked h100 price maybe could talk strategic rationale inclusion customer reception dynamic customer buy h100 depending different form h100 also opportunity buy nvidia aie many different place buy nvidia aie example user cloud got cloud instance one many cloud provider many market store within cloud also sell nvidia aie get remain cloud get thing need enterprise software service u well additionally remember also included dgx cloud give type offering ﬂipped way infrastructure support software service underlying cloud instance term infrastructure h100 another way purchase nvidia aie purchase dgx infrastructure come inclusive software important reference architecture enterprise many different type customer want nvidia full stack everything sell nvidia aie within separately working oems odms build server configuration using hopper product also get nvidia aie term way many different way always hopper many solution provide access software perfect chatgpt build generative ai infrastructure took mindshare omniverse key focus area theoretically killer app next wave ai collaborative platform ai tool said would love update stand today term adoption customer interest maybe think colette kress q matthew prisco colette kress q matthew priscoportfolio whole next five year meaningful contributor omniverse pie omniverse great look see future term 3d internet worked decade looking 2d transformation 3d view going extremely important work continues amount adoption creatives term designer really working 3d world key think omniverse also think importance infrastructure need workstation need and/or cloud infrastructure well may use either way come important part sell license omniverse well omniverse enterprise license help group designer work together term creating 3d environment upgrade see people coming board including usd form factor full content omniverse great increase still important piece u perfect want pause moment see question audience point right keep going anybody question let u know dgx cloud moving next seems like evolution nvidia strategy partnership hugging face seems like great step right direction given previous commentary ideal mix dgx cloud 10 versus csp cloud 9d ratio limited particularly given incremental economic benefit dgx infrastructure full system would sell also dgx cloud take quality quantity infrastructure software providing cloud dgx infrastructure yes maybe reference architecture may approximately 10 sell term dgx cloud different form receive thing limit ability u working cloud provider hone different infrastructure software service top much interest work enterprise building model want build model assistance software service love infrastructure using every day cloud provider assist work great start much interest still setting infrastructure cloud provider right great make sense grace hopper superchip shipping quarter give u update early customer demand read think ramp next one two year maybe large colette kress q matthew prisco colette kressa contributor could data center business time given robust growth seen gpu side thing yes grace hopper 200 coming market second half excited include grace connected hopper architecture thing architected together really solve lot work ai accelerated computing relates processing data come data center really thinking time data processed getting ready acceleration process important part connection cpu also allows large memory position well assist size data processing data putting market type customer see interest stemming csps well company looking create full cluster available training model and/or completing inferencing really really good performance level well good cost excited bring market probably giving update finish term q3 sound great networking side seen quite robust growth particularly last quarter thinking growth profile maybe relative compute data center business could help u rank ordering primary driver business today whether infiniband dpu ethernet whatever may yes networking business acquisition mellanox really really great turnout u understood thinking data center computing important networking many customer culture similarity mellanox could stronger really help area working term acceleration networking working product building gpus leverage capability networking improve break term successful debate infiniband one important type networking infrastructure would need ai workload many top customer choose infiniband purpose really help different type traﬃc come data center preferred process use ai however also focused term ethernet see u coming x. along smartnic capability dpu important process well enterprise csps interested also staging position need dpu hard say priority important know often moving together data center system networking together important u option help end customer fully build data center q matthew prisco colette kress q matthew prisco q analyst colette kress perfect moving line think gross margin expansion data center increasingly becomes dominant portion mix interest segment mix within data center continues improve software customer buying stack kind fair baseline considering annual expansion moving part thinking gross margin stayed pretty consistent largest driver gross margin mix correct mix term different market platform sell also mix within data center business think pricing discussed pricing focused tco add term value many system higher performance also higher amount software service incorporated improved gross margin still part data center business different mix associated high performance larger system continue software additive top long term probably key driver u future already seeing term outlook q3 provided gross margin likely increase something focused term providing right solution customer also helping u rethink software investment hardware investment see necessarily gross margin seeing enabling gross margin today perfect question question curious l40 product come sound like used curious like new market inaudible think saas opportunity yes another great product l40s probably one key one think allows great feature capability one targeting specific enterprise really benefit work hundred different oem provider different form factor inserted existing server platform four different l40ss incorporated ability install standard data center configuration lining different server capability also therefore adding q matthew prisco colette kress q matthew prisco colette kresssoftware capability help discussed initial model often term child model parent model creating training also inferencing great option enterprise also seeing large company consumer internet company and/or term csps looking also inferencing type platform could put together great option guess robust revenue trajectory talking think opex growth within order support especially enter period hiring strategic priority r dollar today right trajectory opex investment important u think market today believe know need build bring market absolutely investing revenue right growing little faster opex mean focused investment investment lot different area certainly engineering front keeping track hiring able also compute infrastructure helping customer configuration overall coming market research engineer using compute internally assist continue make investment area make investment working supplier partner others well number one focus right much investment prioritizing near term new product coming also definitely long term perfect know going quite pile cash upcoming year company think best deploying capital today know 25 billion share repurchase authorization signal continued intent buy back opportunistically overall think nvidia prioritization spend think capital number one thing going investment back business discussed certainly opex standpoint term partnership could small medium lens looking opportunity work successful small medium one find something would something would outside focused term employee equity dilution making sure offset stock repurchase mainly goal make sure limit dilution authorization coming towards q matthew prisco colette kress q matthew prisco colette kressan end refreshed authorization 25 billion take u future offsetting dilution would another use term capital perfect well minute left like cede ﬂoor closing comment area like highlight may missed lot focus right certainly generative ai remember still early stage ai see today know seems amazing work ai demonstrated see future increased ai capability definitely accelerated computing long term think 1 trillion installed base x86 thought quickly people move accelerated computing center great opportunity moving key workload ai using generative ai continuing path probably moving fully accelerated computing throughout data center think see perfect well unfortunately time colette pleasure chatting today thank much joining u thank thanks much
