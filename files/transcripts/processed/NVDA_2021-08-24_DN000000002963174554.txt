right welcome back everybody colette pleasure join u always thank making time u quick housekeeping note moderator q thing finally working please feel free pop always could keep shooting email well great pleasure nvidia join u colette kress need introduction cfo company get started colette reported earnings last week maybe would helpful get quick recap highlighted business condition near term take q great thanks much hosting u conference going start reminder discussion presentation contains statement investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business let first start key highlight takeaway earnings term last week thought term think moving q3 go first data center demand nvidia compute continues accelerate saw exceptional growth last quarter particularly ai inferencing doubled area customer taking deep learning ai workload production shifting away cpu gpu inferencing a30 ramping quite well includes 4x performance improvement t4 prior inferencing specific card q ambrish srivastava colette kressadditionally seeing leadership ai training continue swept ml performance benchmark also strong growth natural language processing deep recommendators important new workload occurring likely going phase industrial ai high performance computing revolution underway see large supercomputer supercomputing taking advantage opportunity introduce acceleration good part industry talk moving overall nvidia rtx nvidia rtx available great opportunity advance overall graphic consumer gaming also enterprise graphic entering holiday season next couple month entering strongest ever product cycle expanding start rtx title rtx title gaming also lean channel inventory also biggest wave nvidia laptop back school studio well holiday season well move talk opportunity high end graphic ca start without talking omniverse power future immersive overall entertainment industrial collaboration approach move forward talk addition highlighting nvidia ai software subscription key opportunity u move forward probably dollar opportunity go forward though talk guidance provided guidance expect another strong quarter expect sequential growth driven largely accelerating demand data center addition also expect sequential growth three market platform mean gaming business mean pro visualization well automotive expect contribution cmp crypto mining processor minimal think outlook going forward revenue guidance next quarter 6.8 billion large portion growth related data center business question answer great term visibility especially given tight thing actually quite remarkable given lead time stretched guy delivered kind growth term visibility please comment visibility given stressed lead time think earlier year characterized visibility data center business strong lot project working visibility look like versus would look like normally time year think data center business understand wide set different type customer yes conversation hyperscales q ambrish srivastava colette kress q ambrish srivastavahyperscales internal use infrastructure also providing cloud instance also meaningful amount vertical industry make portion probably close 50 data center business achieved purchasing certified oems create many different server offering industry also specific sale superpods and/or dgxs work term visibility stem way helping many company hyperscales vertical industry look infrastructure solution solidify trying ai trying high performance computing inferencing lot engineering engagement overall architectural level overall visibility move q3 quite solid area continued growth part helping company end end platform system choice built okay question seems endless demand imbalance certainly seen anything extend long time context could talk lead time especially gaming business sound like throw seasonality window business different big laptop also constrained supply sure let talk overall gaming business may referred lead time multiple part overall gaming business gaming business structured support desktop support notebook support overall cloud gaming require different level supply overall working towards articulated couple quarter supply constrained gaming business way think demand quite high demand strong continue produce strong result term revenue growth continue work different partner supply looking supply also understanding oems aics helping create system board need go market lead time think already determined something usually procuring long term think growth procurement thing made u work partner make sure get board system market also system part component necessary put market feel good guidance provided q3 believe enough supply serve refer company growth aspiration second half well moving next year colette kress q ambrish srivastava colette kressokay many chip company larger run especially want use word resorted resorted order signing many different way really ensure planning help planned capacity colette nvidia done ensure planning capacity better order meet demand given challenge supply side break question regarding planning different type area overall consumer planning consumer gaming planning overall enterprise particularly deal data center data center compute planning perspective gaming take role making sure good understanding growth could happen term consumer gaming plan consolidated level think level supply would need available channel point time leave end q2 go q3 overall supply level channel still quite lean goal continue improve level allow geforce card available gamers move forward working channel partner understand available channel continue serve different market different region term type part want planning come mind show restore channel level look overall data center purchasing overall data center compute long process planning term customer would like also planning side many product ship data center take quite bit time produce end end could think supply planning long period time u serve market trying find solution customer continue area focus oems partner assure everything needed data center available oems well nvidia several overall customer okay helpful let switch gear longer term question jensen address certain extent earnings call software strategy seems mentioned opportunity way think obviously positive implication operating question recap u please three pillar software strategy laid couple absolutely great question new software new software large portion system provide throughout market platform incorporate software three different way deliver software value customer first software hardware could offered separately q ambrish srivastava colette kress q ambrish srivastava colette kress q ambrish srivastavathis case talking may enable software offering enterprise channel purchase oem partner number two software hardware could delivered together platform common csps and/or hyperscales number three community whole whether think research education software free underpinnings example kuder last decade term provided providing capability learn overall development platform think new opportunity use functionality support level three different enterprise example may prefer pay software related support milestone investor looking see purchased adopted recognized revenue immediate inform community aware practice front yeah happy share next couple year term specific software approach separate purchase overall hardware entering space important era industrial growth industrial growth use ai use software likely see first something term overall booking seeing software future see term income statement term revenue go time time happy share seeing area share u example early win since oﬃcially rolled texture told u working many different type subscription key provider many oems fully trained sell overall software application whether base command ﬂeet command enterprise ai software future talk key lighthouse win maybe size seeing term number pickup got got okay let switch demand driver segment start gaming first four quarter ampere launch think mentioned 20 installed basis upgraded help u understand typically long take extent asset brought term upgrade cycle colette kress q ambrish srivastava colette kress important area focus regarding ampere architecture performance delivered ampere architecture gaming also surge gaming use overall real time ray tracing think ampere architecture fairly early part architecture whole probably market year continuing provide new card market time talk 20 20 relates percentage folk upgraded installed base either ampere able take part term ray tracing incorporate prior architecture incorporated ray tracing looking 80 installed base still opportunity upgrade ampere architecture looking prior architecture even look pascal architecture understand great performance enhancement available ampere going forward still lean supply market believe continue serve gaming market card quarter come move season well holiday look upgrade installed base also add new gamers interested ampere architecture availability supply move architecture architecture uncommon reach portion installed based current architecture may majority installed base specific architecture may take opportunity move new architecture entice even excitement performance game coming right getting ready overall holiday season ready ampere architecture market colette right way think installed base year ago relatively simple say relatively simple could look desktop sold laptop cloud gaming think installed base right way investor thinking way think installed base hundred million overall gamers correct many different way achieve overall gaming multiple device leveraging cloud experience enabling standard desktop notebook supporting many different ethernet structure support overall cloud well ability u look many mine gaming site really see well nvidia gpus serving continue one fastest growing gpus list many site staying area focus continued provide opportunity option gamers take advantage high end gaming q ambrish srivastava colette kress q ambrish srivastava colette kress mix laptop industrial could remind u said publicly big laptop business percent overall percent versus desktop far talked quite bit new laptop laptop leverage technology available overall gaming thin light important area gamers would like see successful notebook growing quite well last couple year year date represents probably 30 overall gaming business notebook okay thank question crypto say guy great job addressing cmp product line also communicating u much earlier prior time remind u regarding confidence comment made thought pretty meaningful said expect cmp pretty almost think may word used immaterial business going forward sure let remind everybody term addressed two important area gaming well overall crypto mining focused first getting geforce gaming card hand gamers last quarter ampere gpu card one fastest ramping believe successful strategy want remind everybody though diﬃcult u estimate impact crypto currency mining sale visibility end use gpus however strategy involves providing cmp crypto mining processor card professional miner low hash rate card geforce card gamers allows u steer supply gamers low hash rate card shipped q2 80 q2 ampere desktop gpu shipment early process ampere architecture rtx starting see geforce retail price directionally starting move lower see additional work getting retail price think provided term crypto currency moving q3 choice expect cmps cmp ship minimal going forward look area lot different driver inﬂuencing even last quarter saw profitability mining quite volatile changing term lower well overall regulatory area certain region diﬃcult overall crypto right outlook q3 minimal cmp quarter focus low hash rate card gamers q ambrish srivastava colette kress q ambrish srivastava great let switch data center side provided robust guidance data center business sound like combination vertical hyperscaler driving growth little bit surprised hpc become smaller piece business move vertical hyperscalers roughly half half think exception one year two three year ago deep pull data center spend impact business seems relatively immune server cycle ﬂip side new server refreshes coming intel amt add booster business still think enterprise side still hyperscale side really immune refresh look outlook data center going q3 accelerated growth seeing also accelerated growth q2 q3 line commentary second half fiscal year great opportunity economy improved started see enterprise start open would focus term ai high performance computing type solution time seeing hyperscales build internal seen important driver whether conversational ai whether recommendators important well infrastructure needed metaverse move forward cloud instance also area growth industry focused well term crack cloud instance compute moving vertical industry vertical industry time focus acceleration focus term inferencing work discussed see equal break sell hyperscales well sell individually vertical industry supercomputing relatively small portion high performance computing part along ai included vertical industry piece think demand driver enterprise inference inferencing doubled q2 expect growth inferencing growth occur second half year aligned whatever choice customer may need know agnostic overall cpu would like provide whether come peer whether nothing even want arm overall server going forward well continue support market great thanks correction misspoke said supercomputing head always still think hpc supercomputing interchangeably talk inferencing interesting comment earnings call highlighted well growth seeing versus t4 landscape looking like similar big chunk similar colette kress q ambrish srivastava colette kress q ambrish srivastava colette kressto greenfield opportunity opening sound like also taking share side help u understand much brand new opportunity opening result training nvidia system translating inferencing versus share shift entered inferencing communicated strategy moving inferencing market several year ago entered market understanding market share going start zero area historically hcp market however overall inferencing demand type inferencing customer quite different past inferencing today strong technical diﬃculty high performance necessary technical diﬃculty inferencing specific performance card prior architecture t4 discussed also come a30 a30 based ampere architecture delivers significant performance improvement t4 saw last quarter double a100 well serf training overall system solution overall inferencing solution required technical diﬃculty technical diﬃculty driven vertical hyperscale company hyperscales provide term cloud instance many vertical industry use cloud instance case end customer made egx server oem certified server well technical diﬃculty inferencing inferencing edge inferencing consolidate technical diﬃculty technical diﬃculty power technical diﬃculty meaningful step something typically see new architecture adopted seems like different architecture community getting hand expect trajectory business professional visualization strong quarter q2 growing 150 thinking year ago quarter quarter one first quarter initial technical diﬃculty getting infrastructure employee work home lot purchasing refreshing probably stalled year ago quarter looking current quarter seeing refreshing seeing enterprise reopen serve customer think also important ampere architecture four five enterprise solution well great quarter q ambrish srivastava colette kresswhere ampere meaningful part sale within progress first quarter seeing full quarter serving ambition market ray tracing important gaming provides lot solution independent creator focused product design working many enterprise solely whole part overall company working product design pleased overall growth saw little bit lot different thing definitely seeing demand high end graphic enterprise well okay wanted switch automotive could help stop thinking last week information came tesla pretty impressive d1 chip talking application company kind internal capability built pretty big pipeline comprises hardware help u understand think timing business switch legacy infotainment sell new initiative getting traction especially relates autonomous driving leader company showcase ai know rest developing might developing solution help u understand dispositioning seeing pipeline sure think automotive business right two piece focus one legacy infotainment business part business decade area probably see decline next year move focus focused autonomous driving talked last couple quarter pipeline pipeline revenue 8 billion going 2027 good part focus term agreement daimler ﬂeet car hit next several year see inﬂection point probably next year half autonomous driving solution hit term market passenger car also robotaxis overall trucking focus platform focus platform start even today automotive company infrastructure inside data center build develop term autonomous vehicle decade going forward provide probably strongest performance also complete solution overall hardware inside car software move forward case tesla really demonstrated validated full stack approach importance innovation system networking software term put together interesting see tesla term overall performance always keep mind nvidia still working every single day roadmap sure able show customer well investor term deliver q ambrish srivastava colette kress q ambrish srivastava colette kress great think close running time wanted touch cpu strategy kind related question arm think addressed particularly earnings call might missed give u quick update arm importantly cpu strategy without arm part nvidia continuing execute let first start overall cpu strategy grace grace designed giant scale high performance computing ai use case memory capacity bandwidth energy eﬃciencies always consideration constraining factor case grace designed commodity cpu going largest cpu ever made important grace designed tightly coupled gpus full stack innovation thinking cpu gpu dpu compute storage networking data center whole hopefully see 10x higher performance 10x energy eﬃciency well 30x higher gpu cpu bandwidth grace expecting grace start shipping calendar 2023 think arm arm great overall acquisition working regulator throughout last year believe understand benefit arm acquisition customer industry arm however taking little bit longer expected answer question move regulatory process many jurisdiction come back later term timing think close right focusing jurisdiction across world great question investor question gaming inventory understand gaming inventory lean expect increase expect normal level inventory know many year ago used give number since refrained actually giving quarterly actual number could please highlight expectation normal level sure let break question bit channel inventory channel inventory say provide aics provide market retail purchase overall gaming card well number oems build overall notebook channel inventory lean level probably aligned normally seen targeted level see level week inventory quite low also see higher pressure market imbalance term demand supply q ambrish srivastava colette kress q ambrish srivastava colette kress q ambrish srivastava colette kressadditionally moving back nvidia whole nvidia say inventory order produce new product send overall aics oems discussed call q3 expect sequential increase revenue q2 q3 revenue expected higher provide last quarter aics oem channel partnership time end q3 continuing look balance supply demand q3 still supply constrained term could provide got unrelated question expect supply reach point feel like able match demand always diﬃcult determine demand long term however supply supply meet internal projection growth second half year also planned next year growth focused growth h2 also growth turn corner new fiscal year okay think cover colette would like leave u final thought well thank much hosting u think great overall opportunity architecture ampere data center data center solution focus ai high performance computing importance industry moving towards high performance computing ai software solution let also forget importance high end graphic gaming piece important part enterprise focus well second architecture focused ray tracing solution performance really heart mind customer thank much hosting u look forward next event well thank thank much colette always pleasure thank take care folk take care
