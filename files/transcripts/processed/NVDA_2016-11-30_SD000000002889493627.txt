perfect go ahead get started like welcome everyone afternoon session name john pitzer semiconductor analyst credit suisse distinct pleasure afternoon introduce colette kress evp cfo nvidia corporation going go fireside chat next 20 25 minute microphone circulating throughout room guy bashful crowd today conference today question raise hand make sure get mic colette let start thing guess lot people room somewhat familiar nvidia story always helpful room like case someone little bit le familiar spend minute position company core ip core end market try attack core strategy guess importantly talk little bit thing beyond chip level software ecosystem inaudible really distinguishes lot semiconductor company yes think good place start company founded leader visual computing work key part transformation started four five year ago really focusing gpu computing company mean new gpu computing company looking place gpu standing graphic processing unit could leveraged component platform main component big factor obviously pc platform probably key important application time gaming moving towards transformed company john pitzer colette kressfocused key market felt tremendous growth potential front extremely hard problem solve gpu would leveraged ever uniquely platform moving away component platform incorporating key gpu also development infrastructure platform incorporates development language many time key design capability library framework used market core market today gaming still significant portion business represents 55 business also pro visualization essentially taking graphic processing capability enterprise application third one data center many different part talk also automotive business term automotive today focused infotainment using computing graphic inside center console moving future strategy car overall ai platform going necessary car going forward four market put u unique position ability unified architecture essentially product one market allows u leverage essentially invest four market one significant amount operating expense probably engineer planet singularly focused gpu company business going well strategy really allowed u expand market probably 10x even three four year ago helpful start kind want drill one four business segment growth driver gaming probably good place start still sort largest four business said 55 revenue business able grow compound annual growth rate last five year 20 little bit greater 20 know tied new pc sale period time pc almost 30 peak talk little bit driver helping keep cagr specifically asp biggest driver probably better asp growth unit growth driving cagr time sure let kind talk gaming market gaming market primarily u focused pc yes overall pc market enormous 300 million necessarily growth business sell actual gaming platform underneath pc platform rarely sale term gpu market associated pc normal people pc essentially opening change overall experience gaming inserting new gpu business overall business focused providing gaming platform every type gamer think many type platform gaming get one choice think u got 100 got 1000 something sell overall experience allows u really working software developer game developer better better game game essentially change based kind gpu actually success last three year half year ago calculated overall cagr 30 historically much faster overall pc market literally driver inﬂuencing unit growth also asp growth half half ph coming unit overall growing sensitive pc platform gaming today pc platform playing greatest game social sport people sitting alone playing pong back forth actually friend online friend side bar friend watching game watching professional play like sport essentially sport term gaming esports got people online watching others tournament think wealth video youtube focus play game enormous business extremely healthy people get appropriate gearing ph essentially gamers joining two two necessarily one one term social see expansion broadband access across world think everybody broadband capability u continues grow look western world many sister country want onboard overall gaming population continue see grow gamers continue gamers longer period time 40 year old still gaming discretionary income buy whatever need overall gaming experience second come actual game game playing online type game strategic type game going volume volume franchise around ten year 15 year version 5 version 6 complicated game complicated see overall graphic capability rendering going necessary different scenario additional production value game need gpus go second piece seeing higher asp case price increase case people buying need type game want play buying gpus average selling higher price point term ph fortunate piece right launched recent pascal architecture also big inﬂuence probably one largest increase term performance last generation see pascal mean gamers performance per dollar tremendously higher great john pitzer colette kressopportunity buy exited ph market last four five month six seven different type gaming card unavailable great thing essentially anything 200 price point get buy nvidia available going well last quarter 60 growth overall gaming business initial stage holiday season one question got october quarter think channel transition maxwell pascal asp basis kind channel fill basis clearly waterfall new product assuming high asp product kind first market october quarter probably benefited move january quarter get volume guess rich mix kind becomes little bit le rich pascal side think channel fill sort mix next couple quarter move maxwell pascal sure line come whether would kepler whether would maxwell last generation pascal continued keep customer toe term coming first concentrated given exact architecture across opportunity see market different way feel benefit market one said hey want first different type channel fill want concentrate little bit actual channel channel extremely important u partner enable u deal term building best architecture term managing term channel great relationship working back forth understanding demand believe demand well seeing locally grow growth ph really factor every single region growing every zip code growing every card term growing channel fill inaudible number platform approach designed set key driver software every gaming card go see light geforce experience experience allows latest driver next game come want online gaming second see game playing see type card overall buying case channel fill also see light geforce experience help u concentrate excitement market gaming going forward growth seen seamless execution moving maxwell build term pascal know talk lot lot 20 year hard work make sure manage effectively channel partner john pitzer colette kress john pitzer colette kress john pitzercan see nicely end maxwell beginning pascal say pascal one largest performance improvement seen generation generation replace asp improvement well two thing kind track hand hand think early stage pascal probably four four half month seeing term sale think little bit early say seen significant improvement saw term maxwell generation yes average asp far driver growth factor large factor growth well another element driving gaming business october quarter albeit smaller tegra side business nintendo switch think kind initial build think modeling next three four quarter yes relationship nintendo pleased opportunity meet key specification inside console much love overall console market focused focused relationship appreciate underlying value gpus put case soc number two really important u work relationship know need engineer 100 focused making sure nintendo product great done working time ready upcoming launch number three business model important u appreciated value producing could situation nintendo well nvidia ca announce number nintendo great product great product look really cool hope greater success yes working ceding socs upcoming launch question get gaming growth perspective longer term impact ar vr kind curious perspective guy look separate within gaming look application continues along path higher asp time colette kress john pitzer colette kress correct think would look ar vr essentially next generation gaming gaming today two dimensional overall screen move importance virtual reality thought getting realistic take different character term stand within game hard work done many year improve overall technical capability allow vr ar need need performance ability render speed pleasant experience virtual reality think early stage virtual reality gotten point great experience opportunity increase overall content underlying hardware capable well probably improve overall form factor vr hand many focused platform enabling vr couple way see almost pascal card come essentially vr ready know likelihood going come buy card going factor mind say wait buying able vr later point mean going spending 100 time vr even going spend 10 20 time new game vr old want ready factor type card believe choosing today separate category think extension next wave gaming go last question gaming front competitive side guy done great job last several year taking share marketplace see amd largest competitor coming back market year polaris done roadmap vega next year look data actually unit basis took share back earlier year hard find dollar basis profit basis think competitive market amd coming back new product amd nvidia two firm together quite time however took different approach probably five year ago component inside type pc taken hold determining end customer gamer looking use oems help u see market right think established high performance level think type gaming people want think initially seeing well received think got way go think excited running around track somebody else think make run harder think fun john pitzer colette kress perfect switching gear data center 10 15 business today tremendous growth story go back last three year gone 200 million annual run rate 1 billion annual run rate help audience sort understand extent driven better penetration within supercomputer hpc market versus new workload especially around ai think good u kind introduce data center business seems kind simple talk actually quite bit complexity different area exactly five different market inside data center business spoke overall performance computing market area focused 10 12 different year term growing business area mathematical computation need completed well known using accelerator gpu taking workload cpu travel gpu speed workload think many large data center would benefit getting work done faster largest supercomputer world top 10 application computing using accelerated computing using gpus continues important growth market u growing quite well expanded u market second one talk actually grid virtualization case want leverage vdi environment use gpu instead relationship overall pc gpu cloud environment interested streaming application streaming overall compute capability software layer virtualize gpu experience make approximately 10 15 business space working tremendously citrix vmware others continue build market significantly improve user interface break rest really fastest growing piece three type area artificial intelligence first started many year working many hyperscale’s around world would hyperscale’s focused significant amount data significant amount data different form factor running network trying u make application provide u work better thing search thing term image deduction thing term video transcoding type thing important u noticed search command seems getting smarter reality artificial intelligence behind scene gpu uniquely john pitzer colette kresspositioned available expand use artificial intelligence framework referred deep learning framework deep learning framework framework working inaudible allowed take significant hundred million data point infer answer different computing know answer significant amount data actual accuracy information better hyperscale’s moving speak phone better battery performance term translating information returning back millisecond term need term response work gone application application workload workload hyperscale’s continued advance almost every single hyperscale’s planet term working environment ai number two hyperscale’s also working availability ai mass know evolution cloud computing importance able go online get cloud instance one generated gpu behind whether use gpu computing researcher wanting ai go aws microsoft google others overall another key growth area ai number three continue expand different industry extend many part enterprise process large set data buy supercomputer ai supercomputer u called come eight gpus come fully enclosed storage memory well development layer software layer plug get started term ai five different business term data center drilling ai think one thing everyone room struggling trying quantify market opportunity time couple question along factor first think ai gpu versus fpga versus asic accelerator feel gpu suitable ip attract entire ai market think architectural difference using gpu fpga asic ai computation sure uniquely positioned initial continue work artificial intelligence mainly work done deep learning creating deepening framework overall use gpu well positioned overall programmability openness accepting every single one different framework inaudible work continued focus underlying hardware case remember ai talking significant amount data significant amount processing john pitzer colette kress john pitzerand significant amount processing need happen time parallel standpoint effective waiting week information answer come back could tweak get even better answer overall process gpu uniquely situated case different form factor believe ai computing evolution probably u next 10 year 20 year many different form factor mean perform type work one way know correct would like get opinion seems perception two part ai market training inference training gpu particularly well suited still early training market people concerned move inference perhaps need high performance chip people move different sort architecture one simplistic two world move training inference sort product available sort optimized inference market well think good place start let say training exactly seeing anybody use anything else gpu significant amount performance necessary even move inference continued set card chip whatever putting together enable consistency training environment algorithm overall inferencing process inferencing going wide broad inference using refrigerator using thermostat probably going small watered simple functioning type ai device necessarily something agree would necessarily need gpu going concentrate significant amount benefit already seen term inference using gpu term speed term piece confirming overall training environment done well already seen u come p4 p40 well much much smaller small size fitting existing architecture allowing scale scale providing even energy eﬃcient type use approach would surprise u different type piece along going probably sizable market continue expertise bringing computing platform together question audience q unidentified participant john pitzer colette kress john pitzer colette kressquestions answer inaudible market attacking application actually ﬂow back intel people webcast question view intel xeon phi nirvana acquisition relative competitive front yes lot different type competition think important note even though may referred fpga versus gpu likeness gpus performance level tremendously different anything seen fpgas around long time well necessarily growth case know fpgas used deep learning training type environment actually challenging think designing fpga reconfiguring fpga intel probably working many different type strategy see xeon phi see fpgas see different acquisition thing referred coming soon focusing today focusing today customer today focused trying determine type hardware know focus infrastructure development work need different market working ecosystem building library building top framework assisting speed ai want go focused capability sure seen develop cohesive piece together serve important area see significant today run time session wanted thank colette joining u really appreciate time appreciate everyone room coming join u thank thank
