participantubs global technology conference company participant participant presentation okay thank everybody honored lead keynote alysa taylor microsoft wanted thank whole microsoft team fantastic partner event year think would surprise anybody microsoft nvidia two requested company meeting think say lot tech curve thank brett kendra mary team making available many fabulous elicit making trip scottsdale chat ai number topic u pleasure thank oh great good alysa want take minute share group role microsoft absolutely responsible azure business comprises ai service well data infrastructure digital app innovation infrastructure entirety azure portfolio also responsibility global industry everything regulated regulated industry including sustainability okay alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participantand side bringing thing build via partner construct way bring market keynote could fill expertise try condense 28 minute let hit couple hot topic start okay think might microsoft first occasion least sit investor community formally post drama couple week ago openai understanding probably somewhat limited say love could share perspective share question received know ip ownership extent microsoft might better assuming given thing settled love perspective mind multiple speaker drama openai yes interesting week know would say know committed partnership openai excited see sam reinstated ceo great roadmap innovation ahead perpetual use right ip openai everything need fulfill roadmap innovation okay business business usual okay nice hear let talk another big event recently think played central role guthrie team ignite big event one team member talk customer partner learn couple key take coming ignite alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participantit really exciting event u introduced bunch innovation would say across entire stack microsoft cloud highlight would bring forward big announcement around silicon think pretty prevalent part event first entry silicon introduced azure maya ai accelerator also introduced azure cobalt cpu really part larger call silicon system also announced general availability azure boost technology allows oï¬ „ oad networking security onto hardware improves performance also hollow fiber core improves networking lot infrastructure also announced general availability microsoft fabric new analytical data platform important key asset ai service allows organization able take bunch lot disparate data either different data source different cloud provider snowï¬‚ake gcp able bring data integrated data environment called onelink native ai service built fabric really exciting announcement think tooling aspect also brought azure ai studio preview includes responsible ai tooling like content safety actually govern reason party model azure arc central control plane allows organization management governance cloud prem asset kind hybrid introduced call adaptive cloud allows organization manage central integrated control plane cloud asset able project asset edge environment bringing together decade innovation around edge iot well application management one single source okay let mean unpack first one little bit course led let go new maya chip think one question everybody mind microsoft enormous successful partnership alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylornvidia think everyone question maya fit relationship targeting different workload type maybe elaborate little bit yes interesting ai workload like hpc ai workload different enterprise workload actually workload come asynchronous peak time burst capacity talk silicon system approach system approach really allowing u across network hardware able optimize peak performance well cost u know silicon yet another addition built amd intel nvidia system aspect allows u able control performance workload across variety system thing like boost come play well innovation seen fiber layer well cost benefit microsoft well internally yes think know gpu resource resource capital intense want go unused allows u opaque customer allows u able balance workload backend across plan replace nvidia amd investment adding ability load balancing assuming spent ignite talking ai endlessly multiple speaker yes customer think everybody could also benefit perspective conversation going know adoption curve customer discovery process use case coming initial wave word getting greatest roi might helpful everybody use case see emerging really look three dimension look specific industry use case use case individual function use case give couple example prevalent see industry healthcare one one greatest challenge healthcare organization face physician burnout actually seen u physician burnout increased 43 52 last three year still seeing physician burnout rise technology like dax copilot combination ambient generative ai record interaction physician patient whether telehealth exam room visit automatically analyzes summarizes generates clinical note uploaded electronic medical health record behalf physician reduces administrative burden physician see organization like atrium health deployed dax copilot actually recorded physician average getting 40 minute day back improving overall care patient great use case using ai technology combat critical industry problem horizontal space customer service one using seeing one prevalent use case internally microsoft deployed microsoft copilot service matter month able increase first call responded 31 actually improve satisfaction 12 see use case technology deployed real outcome associated function great example cyber professional think sheer amount data cyber professional reason able detect threat microsoft copilot security actually aid process able come potential threat pinpoint high targeted threat allow cyber professional actually work threat see sort industry function know addition use case often get asked return actual tangible monetary return worked idc surveyed 2000 global company really interesting stats came first 70 organization already deployed ai technology sort show interest level ai technology 91 organization indicated ai project running le year think talked year digital transformation speed pervasiveness adoption speed adoption probably interesting community every dollar reported every dollar organization spent average seeing return 3.5 return dollar unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylorwow know really taking use case starting see clear pattern multiple speaker yes roi interesting let talk little bit microsoft scaling ai infrastructure meet multiple speaker yes incredible demand think perception significant supply shortage nvidia chip comment broadly severity supply constraint microsoft satya leadership scaling infrastructure meet demand absolutely think capacity planning multifaceted start demand planning demand projection demand couple resource allocation resource allocation availability infrastructure also take account thing like lan power see multifaceted approach think capacity planning really system approach keep talking core able able capacity planning across gpu allotment whether partnership across nvidia others well investment able demand shaping geo know wrappered commitment unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participantsustainability actually come need path 2025 footprint within data center also goal 2025 protect lan use data center okay alysa microsoft work ai infrastructure fast yes recall blog post august think satya team talking getting live number h100 cluster hundred thousand h100s coming live next year right big revenue unlock feel azure one thing love understand little bit better constraint get gpu supply ready mentioned yes getting hand chip power requirement different absolutely right literally lan data center networking architecture one constraint greater term standing infrastructure collection alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylorit collection mean think take integrated approach capacity planning infrastructure geoavailability land use power structure mirror demand today forecast demand demand shape like said sort help know different data center certain workload know attuned certain geo sustainable data center others work directly customer make sure best data center possible daily basis monitor capacity data center weekly socket review across leadership team thing like gpu availability capacity integrated approach without giving secret sauce aws google also trying ai infrastructure fast possible difference way azure constructing new ai infrastructure might give competitive edge couple year know think thing point continue point entirety system chip think people like talk chip many year deep partnership across intel amd nvidia continue partnership probably saw yesterday aws entered partnership nvidia long history nvidia part built infrastructure every aspect networking security building able performant customer actually benchmark supercomputing industry 500 cloud provider number one supercompute category feel like integrated approach build infrastructure well capacity demand planning real benefit paying industry benchmarking also customer performant okay let talk pricing little bit azure compute resource yes lot u watched sam altman team recent openai developer day unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa tayloryes number cool announcement day one thing struck really interesting sam talked essentially reducing per token price premium model correct like yes like extraordinary amount correct 3x yes first reaction boy could reduce price per token 3x knowing consumption azure resource big part cost structure mean llm becoming incrementally le heavy probably would great thing azure would respond unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylorwell start saying obviously continue bullish ai growth misnomer industry ai enterprise workload reality digital native small business benefit power ai service making model eï¬ƒcient bringing price actually opening addressable market almost like democratizing correct p time q phenomenon p time q correct allows u able eï¬ƒciency allows u provide service customer barrier entry price eï¬ƒciency ai service actually good thing exactly point allows u democratize service user maybe similar question answer might another question investor bulk compute need change training model inference model le compute heavy inference side go training inference shift change resource need azure well new emerging category right know llm ops ops thing like prompt engineering rag actually one announcement made ignite really bring actually wanting bring tooling llm ops space good thing allows people train model use model kind different model different use case able reason govern model compute aspect model inferencing model data aspect know ai good data estate see compute unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylormodels also ancillary service come building modernizing app data key component storage another key component know look ai platform side compute data service networking storage going ask data service quick multiple speaker oh good one favorite topic first let summarize azure level bret team conveyed street amy last call gave guidance stable azure growth december quarter couple dynamic feel reasonable conclude ai contribution azure growth improve stable mean core part part azure might decelerate slightly maybe scale economy comment little bit guidance would azure growth moderate really scale well think sheer number workload bring online able deliver stable growth know forecast h2 thing would say think azure entirety azure platform right infrastructure layer talked management governance layer data layer know ai service tooling everything provide app layer workload make azure fairly know comprehensive significant look azure growth around growing new workload see customer normal course business continuing optimize workload performance cost know commitment grow workload across every aspect azure cloud making sure working hand hand customer know maximize price performance okay hit little bit get data optimization side think acute interest unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participantabsolutely sure ignite course day talking lot customer amongst thing would characterize microsoft azure customer base term far along term journey optimize spend well optimization ongoing occurrence think bring new workload online whether migrating workload cloud whether building new application constantly optimizing performance workload optimization ongoing part cloud infrastructure cloud compute u two thing want one work closely provide number resource whether azure landing zone service called azure advisor actually help customer build workload construct workload performant way part optimization think normal course business know optimize bring new workload goal help customer build construct best workload best performance make sure working next workload okay talk workload growth conjunction making sure know customer building service beginning okay got let talk data okay number interesting topic one intrigue little bit notion advance perhaps concurrent enterprise moving forward ai alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participantprojects need quote get data estate order yes hearing extent starting pull even conversation today rest microsoft data suite well mentioned ai experience good data ai reason much know step one data set want able apply ai service data set cloud kind step one able access migrate data organize construct way ai service pull number thing aid customer able get data estate order one talked fabric fabric u meaningful investment ai pursuit fabric analytical data service mentioned one unique capability onelake aspect fabric allows bring various different disparate data source shortcut shortcut data mirror competitive data competitive know different whether data gcp aws bring onelake aggregate data applied ai service directly within fabric think take data organize data able call specific data set thing like vector search become important brought vector search fabric called ai search also brought distributed data scale cosmos db ai search natively integrated know aggregation data actually construct access data two really critical important thing fabric ai search major investment made organization bringing data cloud organizing data apply ai service top also curious seeing evidence ai starting accelerate pace organization embracing cloud boosting cloud data migration effort causing acceleration pace running database cloud versus beginning happen sure constant process curious ai acting way accelerant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylorabsolutely think think ai term application either modernizing application building net new application even take microsoft done m365 dynamic github modernizing existing application modernize existing application bringing azure openai service api call data set data important also see increase thing like storage actually store process see api call aggregation data data service increase well ancillary service like storage get build kind entirety stack build upon everything know developer service use whether github github repos github copilot actually coding bringing data operational data service cosmos db mentioned distributed scale database able apply app service top well developer ops management know create net new application entirety service construct build net new modern ai application modernize build seeing really unique across azure platform great example uipath customer modernized business process software azure openai storage networking increased started build net new application building data service brought new data service build new application increased another great example customer real madrid continually trying figure engage fan base able originally call seven data source able actually sorry five data source able call 70 data source able data aggregation talked onelake really unique thing actually increased fan profile 400 two year nice marriage like acr increase importantly customer business outcome increase well might good time ask little bit oracle relationship database azure way alysa profile among investor went massively seated satya larry session think everybody room probably watched fun must right unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylor unidentified participant alysa taylorit incredible experience rivalry defense ph two watch deliver intro incredible experience larry first time redmond yes really kind momentous experience yes big deal investor large organization ubs public information extraordinary
