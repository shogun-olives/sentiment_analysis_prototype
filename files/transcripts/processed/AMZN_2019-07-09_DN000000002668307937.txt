moment deeply legacy pay tv loss deep next five year guided client 2017 said focus bottom half vector see red area forecasting movement 95 million 2017 somewhere 73.5 million 79.7 million 2023 2018 number came approximately 92 million right worse low line mid line tracking currently direction informed client would question many significant record setting q1 significant loss continue continue 3 million 4 million subscriber loss per year taper sometime next five year particularly optimistic still advising prepare worst case new tdg heard u forecasting legacy pay tv since 2006 forecast usually le 2 3 percentage point good team forecaster think grip future legacy pay tv getting predict going continue get worse get better especially light several firm seem repeat annually next year going different next year year legacy pay tv subscription loss tempered bottom found well track track consumer sentiment via survey different survey use benchmarking 10 year always ask scale likely cancel downgrade service take top two ranking mean moderately likely cancel definitely cancel pool together top two score notice blue bar see continually moved q1 research research may indicated 13 top two highest top two seen since began tracking scale least according measurement opportunity number people considering cord cutting rise declining expect trend continue second pay tv 2.0 virtual mvpd using value chain illustrate function pay tv 2.0 operator differs pay tv 1.0 aggregate content distribute content private managed network public internet open internet bring device model one advantage virtual delivery tv app smart tv connected tv ancillary device streaming box game console et cetera qos guarantee way premise assured basically take two four element value chain license whatever content needed like pay tv 1.0 also use device get app platform agnostic geetha pointed seen really interesting growth couple different virtual mvpd operator subscription base growing quickly includes youtube tv 1 million sub course hulu live tv recently reported may 2 million paying sub particular chart show sling tv directv geetha said run wall even experiencing loss late late q4 virtually growth q1 year illustrates hulu live tv others include others include litany operator geetha list geetha ranganathanmonitoring every one breakout right seems hulu live tv fertile model number reason talk get pay tv 3.0 particular model might work want make quick note something commonly understood come calculating pay tv subscription lot people generally take number legacy sub number virtual sub add two together say gross number pay tv subscriber actually actually give incomplete picture lower significant overlap two year survey data report anywhere 30 45 overlap among call dual service subscription among vmvpd subscriber 40 also subscribe legacy pay tv service would anybody subscribe well ask question continually get insight motivation find largely driven uncertainty whether virtual service going live standard expect led expect legacy service option include access travel thing nature primarily dual service subscription uncertainty reliability virtual service overlap continues expect decline time people become comfortable virtual pay tv service moment significant overlap always important take consideration forecast virtual sub also start 2017 beginning point around ph 5 million subscriber point advised client growth movement toward upper half diagram red area approximately 8 million sub end 2018 came little bit high forecast changing guidance believe recent gain tempered going forward believe fall somewhere 19 million 24 million 2023 likely almost split middle get year could think growth continue growth different say legacy addition would different business relationship contract involved easy churn comparison top two number cancellation proclivity virtual 75 higher among virtual sub legacy sub even likely churn legacy sub considered looking viability model section intended set stage see pay tv 1.0 2.0 later progress conversation expand pay tv 3.0 mean meantime going turn back geetha woo jin talk cord cutting winner loser space inaudible woo jin hothanks michael get industry evolves pay tv 3.0 wanted quickly touch cord cutting shaped adjacent industry winner loser whole cord cutting revolution one platform benefited greatly roku stock gangbusters tripling since beginning year woo jin ho cover roku bloomberg intelligence tell u little bit company able cash folk ditched cable subscription great thank geetha geetha said lead analyst

kind borne brunt decline subscription wanted pull chart quickly give sense number cable subscriber cable network subscriber big medium group data reported nielsen aﬃliate fee medium big medium get paid directly related number pay tv subscription see chart back 2018 track two column one subscriber base one track traditional along virtual obviously little bit cushioning effect provided virtual subscriber see 4 decline traditional subscriber get kind paired 1 2018 actually seeing little bit acceleration situation kind worsening little bit 2019 5 2 kind get paired 2 moderation virtual service included obviously subscriber still falling kind whole reason kind precipitating force wave mega medium merger included fox merger warner whatnot also responsible pivot important going see whole ﬂood new service coming market later year actually going pas back michael talk pay tv 3.0 good picking geetha last comment decline subscriber major network industry pay tv industry general trickling impacting bottom line network licensing content service part new reality company adjust noted precipitating large number vertical horizontal consolidation say large content company buying large content company also buying create create create distribute type product buy technology company buy distributor presence cpe looking take advantage new value chain emerging offset loss bypassing choosing add arsenal product bypass traditional gatekeeper lieu ph offering branded d2c service referenced expect two largest player rolling service next six nine month disney+ warnermedia service key another condition setting stage evolution pay tv model wave tribalism go powerful brand decides launch d2c service first thing naturally going hoard high value content disney example chose 2017 renew netﬂix contract pretty much first drop bucket others paying close attention played disney disney going going high value content going distribute inaudible aggregator holding content populate branded service creates different choice environment consumer offer new way access favorite content also complicates pointed earlier well also complicates budgeting inaudible video service become complicated quickly one get one three four five different service question d2c play impact pay tv business model well reason disney others choosing launch service indicated prior slide condition right timing right closely folk closely watching success early success hbo approximately 5 million subscriber cbs access showtime combined approximately 5 million subscriber pardon got 8 million subscriber reported 2018 interesting part seems bit pie sky internal estimate suggesting 25 million 2022 publicly released information expectation astounding forecast call term number subscriber actually number subscription number subscriber around 45 million 50 million 2023 cbs estimate correct could make half subscriber would using cbs access showtime find somewhat untenable rapid growth service surprising folk disney+ expectation probably seen multiple firm internal research say clear voice service tested positively hypothetical service ever tested tdg history number consumer interested paying 6.99 month particular content combination astounding expecting 60 million 90 million subscriber 2024 international viewer word domestic sub range 20 million 60 million number 2024 lot gray 20 million 60 million given enthusiasm observed may survey new offering seeing reason disney ca many 20 million sub 2021 think service move fast major network holding content pulling back high value eight top 10 viewed show netﬂix owned third party studio third party network launching d2c service surprised see oﬃce disappear nbc get along d2c effort important show disappear menu another story talking netﬂix future deal fact lot high value third party content leading populate service important talk pay tv 3.0 want make sure everyone familiar technical legal fcc definition program distributor call mvpd originally defined wo read entire definition want focus last part program distributor make available purchase subscriber customer multiple channel video programming channel traditionally understood signaling path provided cable television system emergence virtual mvpds conception broadened include internet delivery essentially reversed many year case law required mvpd control entire distribution infrastructure back network cpe illustrated pay tv 1.0 previous chart service provided challenged rise virtual going wait around fcc decides update definition mvpd suit purpose think technology business model evolving pace fcc lagging respect ultimately becomes truly relevant whether fcc agrees call pay tv 3.0 indeed mvpd important important able advise client future look like future look like like type chart pay tv 3.0 talking d2c aggregator amazon channel roku channel apple tv ecosystem hulu building includes virtual pay tv service also includes aggregation curation d2c apps see got four element chain connected model want clarify red box around couple clear concept mean d2c aggregator aggregator necessarily populate service curated app store contain proprietary content example prime channel amazon channel content collection available prime video subscriber prime member easily dovetail content type d2c channel wished still serve aggregator doubt term distribution aggregator distribute content provide gateway interact app app company owns app charge distribution guaranteeing quality experience consumption ultimately still byod model interestingly enough many d2c aggregator significant play cpe realm amazon fire tv roku roku streaming box et cetera create virtual integration imagine creating content aggregating distributing content certainly facilitating distribution content branded portal end user could many case device branded device consumer household different play four key element pay tv operator little variance along way end user result integrated service act much like pay tv service type provider aggregate wide variety third party apps facilitate purchase streaming channel call apps hbo app important start using word channel branded content studio app virtual virtual channel single branded portal often paired branded hardware top provide premium channel hbos world d2c apps curated marketplace importantly integrate billing access content search gateway provides much box type experience pull amazon channel app surf around channel add one quickly drop one quickly call toggling new phenomenon observing launching study next two month switch back forth channel within payment ecosystem amazon credit card could quickly add without set new credential quickly cancel without worry without worry billing relationship say hbo talk directly amazon make sure properly billed getting access need portal similar guide one would argue even easier use guide pay tv system virtual interface becomes entry point become entry point lot people watching streaming tv instead traditional live linear tv well primarily primarily service seeing increasing amount live content especially sport come portal via major league service well espn+ see dasan ph entering app store well mix live channel expect see live sport especially coming space give idea brand power folk involved already touched roku little bit let start amazon 55 adult broadband user report using amazon prime 38 watching prime video prime channel resides right see amazon amazon channel responsible somewhere 30 35 app purchase powerful store observed something similar late 2017 early 2018 initial d2c research dominance amazon channel striking said u others said early 2018 others join model particularly pointed roku apple candidate fact transpired roku recently reported 27 million active user 40 12 month importantly also strongly considering producing original remember talking d2c analyst early last year said need keep eye roku likely get original content dismissed idea said going stay model got playing original well earlier year late last year started hearing rumor roku getting original business certainly considering jump apple tv moment reason know little service see go store open gateway much modeled much like amazon channel roku curated app store hulu really interesting saved last recently reported 28 million user 3 million five basically four month end last year may 1st astounding got 2 grown 2 million sub early may hulu live tv service creating curated app store within hulu environment make particular model dangerous pay tv player general 3.0 player offer pay tv 2.0 service virtual pay tv service combination service ad service without ad combination four different element hulu job hulu goal make easy hulu user switch different service based need example want watch nfl season go subscribe certain service month watch bunch nfl game discontinue service switch maybe demand service ﬂip back forth apps service great ease trying create ecosystem combine pay tv 2.0 entry point together user leave hulu ecosystem customize service particular need particular time strong model one key driver observation prediction rise pay tv 3.0 amount research continue subject one fascinating question ask tested told consumer got imagine 20 channel listed choose five channel populate tv service five want included list inaudible apps like netﬂix premium channel like hbo well family network like nbc inaudible et cetera define channel involved big surprise netﬂix topped list popular channel service disney finished second asked actually asked asked folk five service like new service follow question would prefer single operator single service aggregate unified interface got unified search unified billing prefer use individual apps optimized certain viewer like hbo specific app want relationship hbo well 55 respondent said universal across adult broadband user 55 said prefer single app aggregate network together provides single interface search 22 preference 22 said preferred separate apps future pay tv look little bit like past pay tv aggregate role aggregator going disappear fact mentioned earlier get certain point diminishing return four five separate apps expensive diﬃcult navigate diﬃcult search across find type content want even though splintering individual d2c apps expect aggregator begin offer going call bundle package bundle individual apps example might tier three tier service might say x 30 month let say sake argument get one premium app would premium channel listing hbo showtime cinemax et cetera could also get three mid tier channel could get five low tier channel bundle together give discount purchase happens going take cost factor cost element consideration whether many apps first notion well yes many apps paying much might well get pay tv service well addressed sort bundling would real skinny bundle skinny bundle advanced virtual provider ultimately cost increased extent much le expensive full legacy offering type offering could legitimate skinny bundle may eight 10 channel exactly channel want buy individually bundle bundle make lot sense start talking four five different apps striking research done subject led u believe model believe especially amazon roku looking closely model right aggregate apps geetha ranganathan michael greeson geetha ranganathan michael greeson geetha ranganathan michael greesonpresent form paid form pay tv bundle subscriber future virtual future streaming future tv app future aggregator new universe new pay tv 3.0 universe quite solid believe large lot large tech medium company one provide gateway introduce new model right turn back geetha question answer thank much michael absolutely fascinating concludes prepared remark section switch q give u moment okay first question michael think cable network aﬃliate fee via aggregation see going coming year good question think continue go much pressure model right generate revenue margin razor thin look look additional fee way make revenue think geetha actually seen mean gone day 9 10 increase aﬃliate fee kind seen settle like low mid digit obviously vmvpds like mentioned michael kind helped stabilize quite bit think content owner go d2c sure going go substantially think best best case scenario content owner big medium company going try maintain probably like low growth probably going really interesting especially whole d2c revolution agree competitive pressure rise increase rate quickly fear spurring encouraging fueling d2c fire certainly see growing low increase make sense given context next question using analogy internet usage view video aggregator like portal i.e. netscape search engine i.e. google geetha ranganathan michael greeson woo jin hoboth integrate search discovery recommendation across multiple apps mature course offering plate right looking toward meta looking next several year thing likely evolve get point offer service one key benefit integration search discovery recommendation across one apps think incorporate search serve portal gateway either think next question software solution bundle become like browser commodity product interesting point yes extent ip owned individual company roku owns ip design interface see fit amazon get point well still develop interface service wo could say could argue would commoditized wo many player mean going million similar product thousand similar product aggregator interface operate similarly may even look similar want infer somehow commoditized yeah tough word use context similar feature functionality doubt gateway try outdo competitor feature gateway ease use different option available power search engine power recommendation engine et cetera commoditized potential become commoditized extent share common feature set within individual gateway imagine company ph small fortune make sure gateway interface portal optimized value add differentiation point competitor woo jin ho chime depends form factor consumption think mobility instance could potentially commoditized roku accessed via web browser look lot consumption coming still seeing fair amount consumption coming tv either via roku stick amazon fire stick apple tv stick ca carry around tv along one four platform use united state amazon roku apple even android tv win technical diﬃculty one four platform tv box could potentially win smaller form factor side well commodity product definition potentially yes level deployment right geetha ranganathan michael greesonand thing think michael pointed elegantly lot bigger underlying technology helping assisting aggregation number one aggregation different content also billing lot integration need done provider know another third party may willing google wherewithal amazon wherewithal apple wherewithal little roku lot technology focus one bit tv aggregation billing available hesitant say going become commoditized least okay next question amazon ph going able make billion dollar advertising content imdb put conﬂict service think lost michael another question comcast comcast explicitly say aiming position xfinity service program aggregator similar amazon roku see comcast opportunity challenge yeah really interesting question comcast recently introduced product called flex charging 5 month working app aggregator think really trying kind already made shift pivot connectivity really thrust think flex really clever way get people back ecosystem think ultimately comcast realizing obviously main product focus next year going broadband try get people stream take higher tier basically consume data higher price tier think definitely big opportunity course bigger challenge obviously precipitating cord cutting obviously trying careful going interesting see happens launch nbc service 2020 tread carefully exposed side think right look like pretty good strategy michael question one question amazon amazon going able make billion dollar advertising content put conﬂict service old expression fox guarding hen house yes everybody competition everybody level consolidation going sure course course competition inherent tension vertical horizontal consolidation bound compete yesterday partner today partner tomorrow competitor absolutely geetha ranganathan michael greeson woo jin ho michael greeson okay know spoke little bit sport zone ph question regional sport network view regional sport network fit pay tv 3.0 ecosystem app would assume d2c app like many rsns many set college league et cetera would include conversation linear channel apps premium app would included option sure given sport limitation owns right right windowed limited certainly inherent issue role play think extent league continue grow d2c traﬃc like reason regional sport network also involved acknowledging negotiation get right introduce service may problematic area expertise reason prima facie reason could think developing apps including apps type portal type curated aggregator store reason think would included think play question whether generate suﬃcient revenue type relationship michael question talking content creator move d2c platform vendor going beneficiary know focus like top 10 plus sport content creator like content aggregrators let say netﬂix hbo disney hundred smaller content creator subscription basis mean got much room content acquisition consumer mean guy stay subscription based model think cut look mirror say maybe switch ad based model think play think great question think really depends brand network channel talking really interesting report probably decade ago wrote report small channel age streaming far ahead curve author colin dixon many call know lead analyst tdg back analyzed amc network going d2c u let see u usa network outdoor channel conclusion exercise strong niche like outdoor channel might quite may really well competing offering wo bring enough revenue relative could brought part pay tv package large geetha ranganathannetwork like usa reach substantial power substantial could d2c offering probably pretty well got scale could well smaller got really legitimate niche linear viewer truly dedicated content part lifestyle like outdoor channel would maybe hunter fisher fisherman might stand chance fee based subscription level would argue first play would small channel would probably go fee based one portal wait free ad based service see free ad based service know rage right largely driven success svad avad ph aggregator like pluto tv xumo tubi one pulling million million user individual let back want take let take fubotv example able grow subscriber base quickly disappointing got really solid offering especially like sport launched free ad based streaming service creating content another example someone traditionally model create content pay tv operator got creating content launched service heard going launch inaudible tell poorly paid subscription last resort offering spinning marketing help inaudible content necessarily best content give away free ultimately grow subscriber base end mean end growing subscriber think dual approach let move away pay tv operator individual channel think dual approach could helpful think going see lot people starting fee based adding ad based even fewer reverse ad based well silly add fee based mean proven going market see dual approach see individual app much like hulu pay x ad free pay put ad think dual approach likely smaller channel think critical play going play d2c game got get portal mentioned earlier imaginary model fictional model made buy one premium service three mid tier service five low tier service want make sure brand one tier hunter go optimize package better find outdoor channel watch regular tv ca get value service significantly diminished niche filled supposed customizable tv service theory big brush stroke yeah got okay thanks michael actually time thank joining u today question please feel free reach directly one u email listed slide 26 thank michael fantastic discussion thank
