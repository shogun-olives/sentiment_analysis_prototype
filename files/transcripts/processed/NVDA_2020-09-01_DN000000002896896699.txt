vivek arya congrats launch thanks letting ask question actually two one jeff one colette jeff large estimate deployed base gamers see upgrade cycle playing versus saw versus saw turing pascal think unit cycle could also squeeze question colette time colette mentioned working samsung new product launch wondering think kind cost benefit working two different foundry ampere set product thank start yeah go ahead jeff start first jeffrey d. fisher colette kress vivek arya operator aaron rakers right yeah thanks vivek thanks comment launch pretty excited ampere yeah believe typical prior transition seen three business see unit asp benefit ampere gamers continue want buy stack think delivering pretty compelling upgrade opportunity gamers term installed base roughly 200 million geforce gamers look installed base gaming pc 30 maybe little le actually moved turing still large upgrade opportunity ampere also seeing user base grow know covid certainly created energy around gaming trajectory gaming time gamers coming pc gaming see stopping anytime soon yeah vivek term question regarding samsung discussed several year working approach working approach really talk creating team side work overall fabs necessarily time ready launch able merge production team understand process great thing fabs provide honored working really strong partnership tsmc samsung decision side take gaming overall piece samsung really higher performance could provide customized nvidia continue work strategy actually think probably best practice market keep mind samsung also part many gaming product past continuation building upon team created side thank next question come aaron rakers well fargo line open jeffrey d. fisher aaron rakers operator charles long colette kressyeah thanks taking question also congratulation launch impressive going back kind earlier question know mentioned approximately 30 le geforce installed base turing pretty clearly commentary today large installed base pascal user obviously strong performance metric around help u understand much age installed base much sitting pascal even prior generation quick second question curious kind change strategy 3090 product versus prior titan big piece mix titan past much could possibly change broadly 3090 market thank yeah look installed base mean steam example think 20 high 20 steam gamers turing rest would prior generation pascal earlier see upgrade opportunity ampere let see second question think 3090 titan titan constrained sold nvidia.com couple system integrator hard really know potential titan combine titan 2080 ti class product 3090 kind sits middle two guess meaningful part business collectively think combination 2080 ti titan buyer well inspiring new buyer come space thank next question come toshiya hari goldman sachs line open hi charles toshiya thanks taking question congrats one around gross margin think historically guy benefited obviously gen gen asp increase sku mix across different skus transition wafer cost asp largely ﬂat 70 80 generation think ceiling term gross margin going forward mix across skus better way pricing wondering get color maybe part asp ﬂat think ceiling overall asp growth going forward thanks jeffrey d. fisher charles long jeffrey d. fisher operatorsure let start overall discussion gross margin see jeff want add bit term expect term asp correct generation generation continued improve term gross margin company lot growth whether overall gaming business line really platform amount software incorporated really allows u continue reach high end market overall customer case think ampere gaming ampere gaming gross margin coming quite solid quite good baked guidance gave q3 still early determine see life cycle providing ampere gaming probably expect thing seen generation come true number one see upsell see continued excitement try best best done time get average asp overall increase move forward additionally time life overall architecture talk increase improvement see gross margin everything overall value engineering component time tend see overall increase gross margin turn jeff see want add yeah think believe value prop ampere drive upsell would expect see asp lift gamers upgrading higher class gpus get best perf future game seen time prior gen expect stop ampere move turing brand new architecture similar node struggled noted noted struggled deliver great gen perf groundbreaking architecture gen gen perf traditional game compelling yeah turing delivered great successful product delivered great deal growth ampere benefit new node architecture think going great upgrade cycle great thank good luck thanks stacy rasgon jeffrey d. fisher stacy rasgon jeffrey d. fisher stacy rasgon jeffrey d. fisheryour next question come stacy rasgon bernstein research line open hi guy thanks taking question two first think similar saw turing ampere see starting high end stack think might see mainstream offering coming guess equivalent prior gen nvidia like 1600 series secondly given purchase versus available week kind end september foresee supply situation believe enough supply market satisfy demand forecasting thanks stacy always good hear thank term timing launch rollout product think seen turing came rolled product slower probably anticipated could unique time business know take great deal trying care channel wanted make sure sold prior product rolled new generation product different price point ampere channel healthy business strong prepared pretty healthy cadence rolling new device think see ampere cadence new part faster saw turing got supply launch yeah know whenever launch new product compelling ampere doubt shortage product ca ca ramp fab follow demand new buyer quickly said great relationship samsung product volume production begun shipping channel partner start see volume product hitting shelf starting date stacy rasgon jeffrey d. fisher operator harlan sur jeffrey d. fisher colette kressannounced naturally entire supply chain ramp continue grow get toward holiday season got appreciate thank much sure next question come harlan sur jpmorgan good afternoon thanks hosting event good see impressive performance 30 series mix know one big driver gaming franchise team strong adoption gaming laptop especially based design gaming notebook help u understand cadence like going see 3070 3080 based notebook next notebook refresh cycle middle next year see sooner percentage enthusiast class gaming segment made gaming notebook based platform okay first question let colette tackle second first question know ampere talked performance power eﬃciency ampere really great work way stack super excited see ampere come notebook point future announcement today like say sooner rather later allowed give guy date prefer time think ampere laptop really going kill looking forward announcing future time yeah let address question regarding laptop laptop percentage gaming business multiple different platform take market overall gamers standard desktop offering announcing today overall laptop overall console also see term geforce well laptop grown quite well laptop grown consecutively many quarter think 10 seeing harlan sur operator matt ramsay jeffrey d. fisherright laptop really changing overall seasonality business seeing right think last quarter still le 30 business le 30 business great opportunity attract gamers different platform need niche necessarily shelf building refreshing rather something mobile stay tuned definitely come laptop great thank next question come matt ramsay cowen line open thank much good afternoon jeff couple question first one mentioned guy rolled turing performance stats maybe hoped big generational change software side ray tracing rtx point view bit chicken egg developer go rtx wait product et cetera maybe could talk little bit percentage gaming installed base today game know metric might make sense number hour number user et cetera see software development side prepared ampere launch versus turing launched second question maybe could talk little bit level importance new dram architecture product stack sense important anecdote appreciated thank okay yeah rtx mean really become new standard game back turing day developer found rtx time guy course talking paper silicon could give start innovating advance start creating game would run rtx course worked microsoft earlier get dxr get standard apis iteration pretty much paper rtx arrived two year later mean world completely changed guy know console going supporting rt developer investing heavily next generation game support rt fortnite announced current chapter turning rt near future operator brett simpson jeffrey d. fisherminecraft got rt see pipeline new game coming fall support ray tracing think tipping point call passed future gaming really going include rtx ray tracing completely different world kicked launched turing two year ago asked memory well let see working micron last several year memory architecture memory speed fundamental graphic performance need fast memory system delivered last several generation g5x developed micron g6 g6x memory speed differentiating allow really take full advantage graphic pipeline new graphic architecture super excited working micron g6x next question come brett simpson arete research yeah thanks much jeff clarification samsung 8n process saying geforce ampere geforce card run samsung wanted clarify one maybe see offering free geforce buy founder edition card ampere founder edition card interested perspective scaling geforce maybe hold back hardware update activity around ampere maybe give u idea thinking maybe geforce service ampere geforce support virtualization example key feature a100 maybe touch would great thank okay let see 8n asked device announced today run samsung 8n built samsung 8n see changing future 8n great process samsung great partner geforce version

credit suisse please go ahead yeah good afternoon guy thanks allowing ask question one jeff one colette jeff going go back tensor core part ampere architecture sound like used almost acceleration engine gpu rendering kind curious extent ai algorithm becoming important rendering side sort potential benefit back content creation side create deeper mode relative content creator well game run gpu versus gpus colette pricing side know lot thing go pricing strategy think asp 30 series surprised people little bit kind curious extent reﬂection competitive environment jeffrey d. fisher colette kressis really recognition want grow market point clarification sort scale think gross margin 30 series comparable better prior series thank okay ai yeah investing ai year mean news course continued data center side ai graphic huge team researching development technology related ai graphic dl probably visible thing talk first real incarnation said think read dl 2.0 getting pretty rave review image quality performance super important technology playing ray trace game high performance high frame rate reason ray tracing take horsepower render ai deliver better image quality higher performance filling pixel tensor core allow lightspeed super fast burden upscaling similar iq extremely low form ai also developing mean announced rtx nvidia broadcast us tensor core ai greenscreen noise reduction tip iceberg many way ai ultimately allow interact character game mechanic operate naturally tensor core believe going help facilitate type technology occur real time yeah let see answer question regarding overall pricing goal overall pricing think one thing see right gaming architecture ampere goal going important expansion started develop even last year several year playing

price point attract every single person market expansion type gamers using overall gaming gpus really talk price point second piece gross margin gross margin comparison overall turing discussed see saw turing continued improvement gross margin time really hard kind lookout thing inﬂuence also overall component piece overall cost overall memory incorporated hard actually look term going forward comparing gaming ampere versus john pitzer jeffrey d. fisher operator jeffrey d. fisher operatorwith turing turing market two year kind little bit continue work exact kind process thing term improving gross margin go forward feel really good gross margin term sit today keeping mind mix one largest driver overall gross margin whole think good position thank last question last question time okay yeah
