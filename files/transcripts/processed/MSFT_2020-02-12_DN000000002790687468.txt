okay thank everybody great see full house microsoft pleased jared spataro u corporate vice president microsoft 365 marketing thank making trip spending time pleasure thank everybody know oﬃce 365 right sometimes talk m365 people think confused huge brand walk u help people understand product set sure thanks let start let break component first play little bit history component perspective microsoft 365 consists oﬃce 365 em enterprise management security suite window window commercial value started actually kind small bundle call enterprise cloud suite based customer looking buy thing together bundle gave discount found time though customer buying discount course appreciate discount increasingly wanted make purchase together starting see real benefit deploying technology together getting benefit lining latest version software enable essentially new scenario took ec enterprise cloud suite 2.5 year ago launched microsoft 365 product proper last two half year busy taking component making better also really heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataroworking hard across integration component new value prop fact brand new value prop think software target market m365 course strength microsoft always would say go segment view put u enterprise really nice microsoft 365 bringing component together expanded target market let talk couple perspective first look enterprise combination component allows u speak really speak business business transformation really changed sale motion think talk little bit later second thing microsoft 365 allowed allowed u go even enterprise new area example first line worker people largely access kind productivity software previously allowed u go market smb able bring service together integrated way lot management department previously microsoft 365 package allowed u lot thing able software way delivered value see enterprise rightly pointed certain pocket go outside knowledge worker people may never access oﬃce may even window machine using kind enabled people kind get employee base microsoft suite offering company kind pick choose okay might e5 might e3 might skus much mixing matching going result quite bit mixing matching maybe best example would kind talk look like large enterprise take step back look large enterprise course information worker trying help productive thing think u would familiar people carry laptop access computing power laptop go cloud heather bellini jared spataro heather bellinifor lot worker high value worker call first line worker may kind every day carry type computing device increasingly carry phone kind left behind technology revolution focused productivity healthcare sector example great customer st. luke regional health care network profile recently doctor first line worker highly qualified highly paid individual able use microsoft 365 deliver value phone way really help productive like say microsoft 365 license people depending need connect everyone top ﬂoor shop ﬂoor word connect everyone across organization think microsoft 365 first platform really allows u productivity sense spanning different worker type getting licensing question specifically certainly see people license really based need worker license e3 e5 information worker license called first line license use first line worker depends need individual worker level enterprise customer used getting new machine getting window 10 maybe new machine either using oﬃce 365 increasingly using oﬃce 365 like much cultural change enterprise customer move away kind used adopt window technology past even oﬃce technology like start morphing type strategy big change underestimate thing tapping microsoft 365 business transformation general think customer sometimes ready much also change operation able remove lot running server lot instance imaging desktop lot kind essentially kind lower level repetitive work associated delivering service able help professional focused really delivering value come right time right increasingly pressure desire aligned business business objective feel like riding wave demand start business transformation idea also includes kind tech transformation large enterprise recent earnings call obviously strong growth commercial business amy called driver also specifically highlighted microsoft 365 one reason commercial jared spataro heather bellini jared spatarobookings growth ahead expectation think opportunity ahead kind impactful could sure let start remainder baseline stats think help ground everyone oﬃce 365 report monthly active user q1 fiscal year u reported 200 million monthly active user oﬃce 365 q2 reported number em report seat 127 million seat em growing 35 get third component microsoft 365 window commercial reported grew 25 component growing quite nicely new data point share room shared look oﬃce 365 purchase quarter oﬃce 365 license purchased m365 microsoft 365 word trying communicate microsoft 365 vehicle allowing u go sell oﬃce 365 also sell em sell window think kind upside available u pure sku revenue term kind look like even think value prop kind reset value prop conversation u actually make window subscription business right know got guy rev rec window changed year make paying monthly subscription oﬃce 365 window probably people room would normally think transactional purchase started change correct would one thing switch thing subscription business value category tried really hard cloud value oﬃce talk intelligent service associated oﬃce allow u kind deliver ongoing value em management intelligent based cloud service window indicate able real hope u window window commercial end security end user value like timeline example copy paste simple mean lot people across device course innovation introduced thing like window virtual desktop refer wvd area allows u really go virtualization market window exactly right heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataro people wonder much strength success result window 7 end life talk u little bit term uptake seen strong growth reported way discern much impact end life course go back data point q2 25 growth billing window commercial kind starting definitely window 7 end life continue driver u think continue even laggard catching look real value window commercial go well beyond end life moment u excited window security really anchor thing people excited starting recognize o one done work security service keep secure value think look growth would say see sustained growth billing window commercial business exciting u something people would thought couple year ago see real strength even kind emf strength seeing go back 10 year ago even prior people would say would pay microsoft security right market company evolve offering security window device corporate would say want pay microsoft making secure went whole debate way back em central story seem customer perception evolve got 127 million user em em foundational everything review component year think asset identity management security compliance four component make em think value prop m365 tapping kind digital transformation business transformation divide three bucket bucket personal productivity kind helping end user productive matter organizational productivity helping entire org productive finally kind guarding security compliance em critical delivering three value like super super important think identity increasingly identity right identity across heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataroinvestments investment becomes central investment point becomes control plane like think even get management kind boring people starting recognize cross device cross platform management super important ability em example manage window device go across manage io android device state really important kind inaudible value delivering entire suite make important go drive kind microsoft 365 revenue seeing people starting recognize need invest area think oﬃce 365 mentioned 200 million maus recent call 127 million user emf think gaap number converge start see think potential em oﬃce 365 base totality absolutely let answer specific question broadening think business specific question would absolutely think 200 million mau would certainly want attach em definitely think dip two number upside also think dip mau seat oﬃce 365 dip disclose seat delta calculating general pattern see would go component me3 microsoft 365 e3 step people me5 monetization train raiding right pattern essentially developing sale force caused u develop new sale motion entirely go new sale notion well awesome opportunity use sell kind coverage oﬃce essentially call wxp word excel powerpoint could add outlook perhaps mail core value prop productivity microsoft stepped way beyond wxp people think oﬃce sale motion coverage coming saying hey person need email need oﬃce moved much solution sale kind oriented thing actually able walk talk heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataroabout personal productivity organizational productivity security compliance upside tapping new budget awesome downside little bit longer sale cycle kind balancing u go new opportunity think people migrated oﬃce 365 early maybe use emf noticed trend situation could talk people actually maybe using something else emf using oﬃce 365 started converting switch right see happening absolutely one idea example come mind national bank canada start kind got motivated started specifically idea business transformation interested kind coming 21st century everything heavy heavy oﬃce user generally oﬃce user kind oﬃce staff necessarily retailer able lock stack moved microsoft 365 suite mean going oﬃce adding em window commercial also particular case introducing team new way collaborating within six month organization went nothing kind collaboration 50 org using team within nine month 80 really nice way kind seen move old profile customer kind like see customer amy also talk success impact em adoption azure azure gross margin per seat pricing model seem like lot runway continue see penetration also idea time could see upward sku migration even though someone might existing customer paying 5 per user per month going opportunity similar oﬃce 365 start moving skus existing customer actually start driving even incremental revenue absolutely microsoft 365 strategy behind based idea think someone using microsoft 365 find even gate higher arpu lower churn really good heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spatarothen finally point exactly much higher propensity time consumed call premium skus e5 even component e5 give u opportunity walk stack u golden formula love microsoft 365 drive business talked little bit lower churn mentioned material cause lower churn let go enterprise smb enterprise churn something really big problem u right move smb certainly turn something part managing business time microsoft 365 helped u delivering new value go beyond kind word excel powerpoint definitely able see change kind shape churn look like positive direction u think overall kind using microsoft 365 effort new sale motion implemented value selling also value realization invested instance got csm customer success manager lot tech company new microsoft last couple year across stack segment actually go help realize value using got great number show using getting value churn go away like fact add go stack term skus add time right take look security market typically best breed market right guess think ability compete point solution exist across various category place useful step back talk strategy microsoft 365 general inaudible security think come heather bellini jared spatarotalk team example really going call compromise strategy think think best integration possible particularly security look player point player gone best breed particular area see opportunity actually really go make investment way matter look invested security start identity talking em later move device go device apps move app information apps got way cloud service finally cap threat protection essentially kind look across touch point infrastructure area trying invest deeply committed best class addition investment also investing across area way think make u differentiated ignite back september couple product announcement lot product announcement couple project cortex also endpoint manager product announced feedback far also evolution expecting skus yes great feedback let talk endpoint manager say management place sleepy feel like increasingly becoming strategic company recognize hey first step digital transformation business transformation actually making sure get directory right making sure manage device right endpoint manager u microsoft endpoint manager brings together tune config man two kind one cloud one kind based service put single integrated service really big deal u reaction super positive project cortex refer heather really big one u open new market u brand new tam essentially idea knowledge capturing knowledge within company using ai actually identify codified knowledge way valuable one simple example would taking whole heap contract pointing cortex actually pull q understand contract everything late fee deadline would coming thing usually human go scan cortex whole new investment area think brand new tam u answer final question excited way pursuing m365 microsoft 365 look tam expansive opportunity heather bellini jared spataro heather bellinisome adjacent push u little bit really bring definition productivity saying going expand productivity look like looking problem challenge customer window virtual desktop mentioned think announced product back september think mistaken heard customer citrix yesterday mean got complementary partnership question come lot investment community kind see relationship also ambition product let wvd window virtual desktop talk partner let talk strategy first said wvd excellent success u defining feature window virtual desktop ability change economics virtualization able change economics run multiple user virtual machine way seamless user experience kind ca believe allowed u deliver virtualization different level term pricing love second always producing great service love partner come add top service exactly trying citrix case since beginning time run ecosystem see opportunity citrix certainly see opportunity build top wvd service third go forward u continue work customer start started deploy wvd get excited see opportunity really rethink computing look like time mean take step back look instance able buy fairly low cost hardware endpoint deliver would equivalent 10,000 20,000 machine virtualized experience change economics look like deliver computing power end user see opportunity investing place space see lot opportunity u interesting market think people hoping would really fast growing market fast follower server virtualization happened mean starting definitely getting better data point around last year need see happen mentioned right 200 300 box right put desk jared spataro heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataro heather bellinito give experience might working hpc machine need happen order become reality would say three thing number one endpoint need become virtual like cloud aware let call take step back cloud aware way take virtualized service pop experience way feel native today little bit clunky spending something window sudden look like whole new desktop might virtualize app feel like belongs endpoint need get much smarter much intelligent number two service need get bit finished today look wvd way spin virtualization think want go opportunity finished service offer kind unique spin number three think think opportunity really rethink virtualization deliver new value mean certain sector like healthcare place found value virtualization think place security compliance desire instance deliver kind footprint list computing environment would really matter virtualization hard expense people found first two actually think new use case evolve rich fertile soil u grow business sure hear u time got handful question recognize lot people audience wanted check see question field could move somebody got ask team care right ask team beautiful jared spataro heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataroall right increasing area focus sure lot press recently announced think 20 million daus right back november correct user adoption engagement track versus expectation phenomenal honest let start dau thing lot needling let define dau daily active user u maximum number user taken intentional action hour period really important hit call passive action count auto boot count minimizing window count closing app count also lot question got yeah skype count release number feel like want get weed kind argue people dau real love seeing team team many way become campus project best microsoft 365 way think new opportunity u think operating system future really look like put people center make comment communication kind backplane people work together layering business process layering integration line business system sale mean truly truly phenomenal taken u want somebody ask really love happening heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataroit become someone say business digital transformation say team even ask question say team hard u way really represent new way working conversation enterprise gone go back year ago 18 month ago still probably pretty nascent market adoption really seems like inﬂected caused market changed sale people incented differently really cause inﬂection internal external factor external side see company desperately want find many way symbolic clear way change working together team allows able say hey new way thing form one value prop chat call collaborate say going certain business process way kind symbolic value company change internally started realize lot demand good product market fit always looking like catching fire realize wow thing fire course mobilized resource go help customer adapt hired lot customer success manager really important set investment made certainly worked really hard integration team rest kind productivity element people use suite product investment well type interaction customer one competitor market would highlight limitation product highlight thing ca 5,000 people channel otherwise multiple channel might defeat purpose trying seamless communication form real term back forth term functionality guess start think think form thought hub teamwork multiple competitor trying team going pull together slack zoom dropbox google kind fact life choose use team competitor strength gap would say super clear gap leader category invest every day every day heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataroevery day close gap please think know also real competitive strength also working really hard strengthen thing let focus second mentioned gap pick top two three kind development cycle fast iterating product whereas maybe year ago maybe six really big gap overcome might three help u think gap evolved narrowing gap also top one two value proposition going customer lead know far ahead great take chat colab place behind year half ago boy gap chat colab versus chat colab folk almost point still couple small one scale mentioned one kind channel scalability would example one ca think many others work customer really big difference even platform investment example work make team platform far ahead competitor take instance meeting company like zoom done really well small gap seen course last 18 month done lot instance quality feel really good quality stand today look across others gap small getting smaller way feel go back strategy strategy really best integration compromise exactly trying go question like say walk customer win day every time end combination hub teamwork win every time say hey watch going go paying someone chat bringing three people document see face finally moving approval workﬂow submit bid happens one platform totally differentiated winning right right think helpful thing people think paying point integration go team heather bellini jared spataro heather bellinithere two really big aspect integration go team first actually find way plug workﬂow mean ﬂow work together everything detail identity kind access like put thing referenced one practical bucket thing second practical bucket thing end security compliance create security compliance boundary around thing ensures secure always scenario compliance regulation matter industry field work two area integration expensive place investing platform last question marketing team marketing strategy enterprise level also think recently gotten little bit maybe double got aggressive smb side talk u walk u kind different way attracting customer bet inaudible think love working focused hey find opportunity let double use word let really go team certainly popped one 12 month 18 month ago think kind broad air cover investing resource advertising something typically app started kick nfl prior super bowl continue u expand market important find category still need find way make sure people understand think attracting people worked really hard call single place people go sign whether license already know license want get going product working super hard single place go go team microsoft.com sign smart enough know company license put right team experience connected everyone start new free tenant way kind really working friction week week week process really important part new microsoft great think time jared thank much appreciate jared spataro thank
