okay welcome everybody nvidia presentation han cover semiconductor chris evenden u senior director investor relation going fireside chat feel free ask question going breakout afterwards caraba corova cordoba okay go okay chris welcome let start graphic company changing least historically graphic company give u update happening core gpu business resilient pc market kind weak past couple year okay fundamentally visual computing company product make say graphic processing unit couple way making money technology one building gpu selling number market think one referring geforce market consumer graphic market think best way think one surprising lot inaudible year inaudible really well inaudible pc market inaudible two market compete inaudible oem gaming gaming market actually healthy pc gaming well estimate market growing around 10 year growing within think gained little bit share year year contrast oem market tied mainstream consumer notebook largely weak market obviously decline strength han mosesmann chris evenden han mosesmann chris evenden han mosesmanngaming market outweighs shown quite lot strength last 12 month okay working everybody everybody hear shout well use staying topic gpu game console series new game console come impact potentially impact geforce business sure intuitively think impact geforce share wallet argument right much money consumer spend gaming pc gamers typically one console game lot device however seen mean really really strong q4 impacted q4 q4 would wonderful without appear seeing weakness due new console launching reason lot good game coming pc look like pattern seems set continue one interesting thing new console architecturally speaking essentially pc although gaming pc scale sort right bottom end gaming pc think make lot easier easier mean cheaper software developer game developer port game across pc console mean see game available quickly pc good gaming people buy gpus want buy gpu buy gpu want play game experience game better high resolution special effect whatever okay staying gpu side thing recently disclosed past year thinking licensing technology work timing would customer chris evenden han mosesmann chris evenden han mosesmann chris evenden han mosesmann chris evenden han mosesmann two way license technology licensing graphic core taking providing something value customer also enforcing ip ip right intellectual property right well really focused former would use latter came much focused licensing core people would people building socs phone market conceivably even inside market example smart tv smart tv interesting market obviously us sort need sort technology provide whenever looked market able make financial case building chip specifically market however go tv manufacturer already building chip say world best gpu video encoder block would conceivably market phone manufacturer adjacent business timing timing conversation people nothing report something report challenge something say 78 complete say han last time ever fireside chat coming back inaudible yes always chris evenden han mosesmann chris evenden han mosesmannokay diﬃcult actually signed deal got signed deal think nutshell okay set next question get lot investor arrangement intel agreement second agreement end concern investor 60 million get per quarter intel net go away go zero explain put take potential new agreement would happen would right licensing agreement originally signed 2004 updated 2010 2009 run march 2017 cover patent march 2017 perpetuity intel right patent perpetuity way right intel patent period perpetuity well important point mean april 1st 2017 nothing u intel right patent situation start rectifying fairly quickly file around 500 1,000 patent every year see think right strategic approach take towards whether want renew agreement want renew think value going forward bear case zero probability u renewing agreement intel 100 probability one else sign sort licensing agreement u meantime think truth black white truth going somewhere somewhere licensing revenue get closer able report actually sign deal able report get closer march 2017 yes able talk intel go right go tegra exciting stuff question audience q unidentified participant q han mosesmann q unidentified participant q han mosesmann chris evenden q han mosesmannquestions answer technical diﬃculty repeat question recently stabilized pricing raised price yes supposed going okay yes interesting statement price supposed going mean one beautiful thing gpu market price going would say last 12 month price actually gone largely mix thing mentioned gaming strong oem weak blended asp actually going within even within gaming asp least ﬂat look data sure think least ﬂat absolutely strong competitive position amd launched range new card launched couple new one lineup start launching new set launched first maxwell generation architecture well feel pretty good competitive position look back market share number last three year somewhere 58 66 market share entire time moved around bit relatively stable would expect continue one caution around market share number though unit share number dollar share number mean dominated volume oem sale see fairly significant shift market share unit market share without actually seeing much change revenue course even le change profit share fact one quarter last year unit share went according mercury number dollar share clearly went continued perform well high end chris evenden q han mosesmann chris evendenany question right let go tegra tegra average tech analyst mixed emotion tegra term tegra 1 tegra 2 tegra 3 lofty goal reasonable goal able incorporate modem functionality new tegras icera modem yes give update tegra tablet going smartphones deemphasizing smartphones going area automotive example give u rundown stole thunder tegra intersection visual computing android basic strategy believe android verge becoming ubiquitous wherever visual computing wherever visual experience matter android believe successful tegra might smart phone super phone might tablet automotive box gaming device la apple tv sort product right launched new tegra chip call tegra k1 first chip launched gpu worried power consumption say power consumption fit within envelope smartphone function expect pc graphic chip opengl 4.4 directx 11 also cuda programmable core well general purpose compute gpu enables example regard gaming unreal engine 4 ported across new chip mean make unreal engine middleware game make essentially programming language game write game top unreal engine make easy trivial almost port game one platform another running unreal engine think unreal engine probably popular aaa game engine aaa title gear war example written previous version unreal engine demo actually used ce show tegra tegra k1 one ran one written ps4 one written pc ported straight across written unreal engine platform q han mosesmann chris evenden q han mosesmann chris evenden q han mosesmann chris evendenthe thing showed ce version tegra k1 think first company think still company demonstrated android running chip far see device based back half year see device based version tegra k1 first half year mobile world congress last week showed tegra 4i two tegra 4i phone 4i integrated application processor plus baseband see lte baseband lte yes 2g 3g 4g lte really taking going pc space running game saying android able play pc game compete basically intel platform yes `` compete strong word know actually compete certainly able build android chrome device much computing graphic power device tegra k1 think powerful xbox 360 ps3 last generation console able gaming experience user experience level quality think got benchmark compare directly current integrated platform comment suspect gpu powerful integrated platform available x86 side fence today going back tegra tegra 4i strategy seeing number new player mediatek marvell broadcom even intel want joint lte modem integrated soc party sole kind party qualcomm past couple year another guy differentiation strategy differentiation come back visual experience gaming visual computing general right lot talk lte modem think really artifact fact one player modem moment q han mosesmann chris evendenand two year hence bunch people perfectly competent lte modem one obviously point wo think twice modem wo lot conversation mode conversation wifi chip pc right another piece equipment modem better modem probably good enough probably diﬃcult average consumer downright impossible average consumer differentiate modem point conversation go back application processor change user experience think combination graphic technology software ecosystem built around differentiate give consumer differentiated experience whereas someone relying modem solely modem wo able differentiate way modem pretty good question tegra chris right move quadro workstation professional solution business tesla computer supercomputer portion business 20 sale high gross margin sticky tell u explain layman term business transition grid grid street trying figure big kind stuff grid know transition grid think grid separate quadro graphic professional graphic principally cad workstation also special effect oscar composed quadro video editing sort thing professional user tesla something different using gpu graphic compute actually performing mathematical calculation number application map well parallelize well weather simulation might one equation modeling derivative another one actually map well grid putting gpu cloud making graphic performance available network graphic running remotely three different business want talk let talk grid grid main focus right number way monetize technology managed virtualize gpu put network number way make money q han mosesmann chris evenden q han mosesmann chris evenden q han mosesmann q unidentified participant q han mosesmanngaming looking beta streaming gaming running northern california right main focus today improving user experience citrix vmware user two adding gpu virtual desktop infrastructure used citrix vmware improve user experience average user also enable new application 3d application previously supported citrix xendesktop vmware today stage hundred trial worldwide running number trial increasing rapidly think 40 point yet talk revenue enterprise purchase cycle two year around six month end year would expect u better idea conversion rate trial average deal size data exists yet right end year would start would expect start see convert production system tam roughly speaking tam question always challenging right look inaudible billion believe probably another look analyst day get plug analyst day march 25th three week away three week tomorrow billion say moment million revenue somewhere away right ted come inaudible keep talking financial software like addition model inaudible chris evenden q unidentified participant chris evenden q unidentified participant chris evendencan repeat question yes sure asked potential software licensing part grid business would fairly way fairly typical business model enterprise market truth told updating software regularly stay date latest application enterprise user running absolutely possibility early discus exactly business model obviously discussion potential customer right run trial quite happily new cfo actually background anyone help u figure right business model market question share buyback give u update would wait analyst day asked share buyback last year returned 1 billion shareholder year said return 1 billion 160 million dividend roughly assuming stay current level leaf 840 million share repurchase announced 500 million asr february inaudible actually asr executing authorization north 1 billion forget exactly think 1.3 billion 500 million executing run june think think asr last major buyback feel like right way go mean company terrible deciding buy stock spread risk period time asr actually get discount average price time get 60 share front theory everyone win win get take risk equation investor win lot share taken table front whoever executes asr assumes generate profit trade q han mosesmann chris evenden q unidentified participant chris evenden another question yes going license inaudible technology board manufacturer use inaudible competitive advantage inaudible question reinterpret question start licensing gpu technology compete tegra essentially right saying think oddly enough reason ideological decision whether build chip maybe ﬂattering way put strategic choice company make make choice based know special knowledge matter imagine apple decide sit around table look detailed strategic choice idea probably sprung steve job head build chip control aspect example right way actually licensing technology open market still emergent semiconductor market compete market compete use example without implying one thing whether look samsung example chip buy chip company like think going change either two strategy way forward started licensing technology way could compete samsung business tegra percentage device device licensing technology compete device like said example illustration purpose give idea think whole market market whole q han mosesmann chris evenden q han mosesmann chris evenden q han mosesmann chris evenden yes oems made decision include intel apple samsung give sense made decision make socs license graphic technology arm imagination right question tegra go another topic okay chris moore law slowing using tsmc transition going tsmc kind go finfet going nanometer finfet road intel offering foundry service lot issue going committed tsmc would consider going intel intel basically said talk anybody including competitor tsmc best short answer fool think looking supplier send send test chip foundry every find point technology business term right think would put chip foundry reality date tsmc extremely good anyone match right committed anything left think left automotive going go anything specific think well talk tesla excited tesla right let talk tesla like talk tesla tesla interesting business tesla using gpu compute frustrating ir guy clearly much excitement around tesla see many really interesting application stuck sort 25 million quarter couple year actually recently burst limit think couple two reason think one enough code supported q han mosesmann q unidentified participant chris evenden q unidentified participant chris evendenare like numerical common many application supported tesla enough channel term company like cray ibm nec supermicro take market whereas year half ago sell tesla company would actually go company evangelize parallel programming company help code porting make sale conceive situation researcher drug company looking protein interaction say know molecular dynamic code accelerated tesla know ibm sell tesla server phone ibm salesman get one delivered friday business scale seeing business scaled grew 37 year year last year reason optimism looking additional market like consumer internet big data analytics consumer internet company proving quite rich seam mine well tesla still relatively small part revenue hinted earlier extremely profitable lot fall bottom line think people underestimate impact eps business ted quick one seen uptick hyperscale web 2.0 company adopting tesla seen uptick hyperscale web 2.0 company inaudible amazon us tesla aws fairly focused application right company like say consumer internet company making pretty interesting use tesla smaller larger scale bunch example steal analyst day wo bunch q han mosesmann chris evenden q han mosesmann okay minute graphic company get sticky relationship european car company series car company incumbent decade really interesting actually think growth keep going back visual computing like pr automaton visual computing look make difference car experience quality net got originally nav dvd playback quality varies lot barcelona last week cab priuses one version digital dashboard actually lucky enough drive friend tesla motor car couple week ago another version digital dashboard quality pixel quite startlingly different tesla honda dashboard could dream charging 100,000 right increasingly experience car metered electronics quality graphic speed update nav resolution display realism dial increasingly seeing cockpit physical needle dial one element element going really interesting going forward gpu good taking data turning image gpu also good taking image pulling data image recognition example going important car company move towards ada advanced driver automation system show tegra k1 taking video feed front car recognizing white line even reading road sign speed limit sign side road figuring far front car car company move towards ada system powerful u audi announce using tegra k1 ada system shown really interesting demo example car manages traﬃc move car front stop move car front stop keep pulling forward also stay white line steer well feature like audi think going car end decade really power gpu real quote real gpu really help u chris evendenchris thank much thank everybody thank
