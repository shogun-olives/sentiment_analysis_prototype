slide present today hoping spend time responding specific question type think taking written question mandeep help facilitate get mentioned run idc business analytics information management market research practice case partnering bloomberg bring latest research specifically around business intelligence analytics market team analyst cover different aspect market see slide taxonomy map different discrete market segment space 2014 40 billion market expect year close 2015 close 42 billion software revenue global software revenue includes license maintenance subscription revenue subscription include professional service hardware add would least triple number context look market three broad segment bottom analytic information management platform database relational data warehouse well newer form tool nosql database hadoop source data land come different source bucket also data integration tool data quality data extraction transformation loading tool think tool like informatica example side box continuous analytics streaming technology used case necessary top platform two broader bucket side performance management analytic application apps vendor vendor software vendor specific business function industry could finance department financial service industry finance department could budgeting planning consolidation tool like application like could marketing analysis sale analysis function et cetera along line major business function case industry specific could fraud prevention specifically consumer banking example credit card company could supply chain optimization manufacturing predictive preventative maintenance asset industry focus today upper side business intelligence analytic tool see query tool reporting tool apps stand online analytical processing multidimensional analysis visual discovery also segment market advanced predictive analytics tool statistic data mining software small segment specifically targeting spatial spatial information analytics gi system content analytics real unstructured text rich medium analysis broader market mentioned 42 billion market vendor share right full year 2014 obviously expect change share percentage give sense even full year 2015 give sense ranking least overall market bi segment overall market oracle number one primarily biggest data warehousing vendor biggest information management platform vendor followed sap primarily businessobjects portfolio bi analytics inaudible also various analytic application database ibm follows u microsoft sa teradata salesforce salesforce primarily sale marketing kind embedded bi tool recently came new standalone bi analytics offering wave talk little bit later overall market going drill little bit 11 billion segment based 2015 expected number query reporting analysis look segment see additional vendor popping top 10 qlik tableau tibco spotfire division kind older midsize vendor microstrategy information builder well obviously thing jump immediately faster growth rate become known visual discovery vendor tableau qlik spotfire historically came different user interface legacy product sap businessobjects oracle bi tool acquired hyperion ibm cognos vendor growth think differentiation continuing probably well almost certainly continue foreseeable future competitive landscape starting change starting change big vendor comparable product portfolio specifically visual discovery going come back slide look segmentation query reporting visual discovery distinct segment many case vendor discrete product used case address different audience one could business analyst might data exploration another production reporting would embedded report could compliance reporting could relatively fixed financial report necessarily changing period period need pixel perfect even financial statement go consumer often based type reporting embedded reporting software query ph use classify legacy multidimensional analysis query tool look market share market still 50 legacy query tool visual discovery growing aggregate historical cagr 2014 historically growing around 19 includes tableau qlik spotfire also visual tool visual discovery tool vendor well advanced analytics slightly 9 10 historical growth rate represents 20 bi market reporting although get press mindshare also certainly decent sized segment still need continued need market clearly specialized tool showing higher growth rate legacy bi suite like cognos business object oracle product think important note substantial change latest version tool mindshare kind perception audience user still bulky visual appealing intuitive tool continue think diﬃcult change mindshare short term key vendor focusing little bit visual discovery market key vendor right one besides one mentioned also microsoft power bi toolset amazon announced aws quicksight new product also salesforce wave analytics analytics cloud offering see vendor multiple product think conducive address market way customer audience buying different stage maturity could fact different audience buying increasing tendency buy directly line business central usually bought enterprise bi tool last year colleague idc study showed 60 60 new budget coming line business rather think end 2015 would think moved even higher impactful think trend expect see going forward think starting happen small tableau continues grow rapidly seeing lot competition sale marketing cost going net new license revenue starting slow think part reached certain size getting close annual 500 million harder sustain growth point unless invest significantly net new sale mentioned early competition starting increase think part also pricing pressure power bi microsoft coming 10 per user standard division 10 per user quicksight similarly priced little bit quicksight little bit higher price additional feature fraction tableau qlik enterprise tool cost oracle released new cloud bi oracle bi 12c visual discovery tool well also priced much like microsoft amazon product rather standalone product vendor obviously reliant revenue survival one many product probably way even loss leader get customer cloud platform application tool think microsoft amazon entry market significant kind ecosystem developer significant developer likely use one preferred platform develop application bi application analytic application based platform somebody already data much data aws make sense tableau also try least try quicksight satisfies specific functional requirement like much likely go quicksight microsoft microsoft shop certainly smb market large percentage make sense also start using power bi think salesforce also significant quite get reaction product came amazon product came think short term even bigger impact business user side salesforce really owns lot sale management sale analyst relationship seems like add another product incremental cost start getting additional analytic functionality already salesforce customer since announcement wave analytics horizontal generic bi tool also announced sale analytics one analytic application mentioned upper side market map marketing customer service analytics marketing analytics coming well even faster deploy incorporate certain commonly used visualization key performance indicator metric workﬂows many case attractive sale manager using salesforce additional analytic functionality salesforce ibm announced last month cognos latest version cognos analytics big revamp existing portfolio coming kind modern age visuals functionality visualization think one thing starting happen almost vendor moving towards memory memory based deployment system think within next three year new version product memory based obviously part function lower cost memory feasible provides instantaneous access response rate tool advanced process term visual inaudible data primary benefit speed speed processing many tool fast primarily connected relational data warehouse starting connect various form various type connection big data source like hadoop spark hadoop mapreduce versus spark nosql database well slightly lesser extent many way vendor announced big data `` big data version product really case mean adding hadoop database store system marketing play certainly emerging important sort source need able access term geographic coverage specialized vendor pure play qlik came spotfire came europe sweden qlik much higher percentage sale coming europe think partly contributing slower growth rate although quite well established north america well certainly came later later smaller presence tableau tableau reverse position claim customer 100 country really primarily dominated north america ceo recently moved europe live think expectation would involved growing business western europe least large vendor obviously opportunity lie across distributed brought global reach certainly oracle microsoft ibm sap little bit geographic reach aws difference vendor tableau qlik became today bypassed many case bypassed went directly line business user eventually deployment grew certain size forced embrace start supporting qlik two product started qlikview ﬂagship product long time started fashion mentioned feature functionality added became like complex set manage increasingly took purchasing deployment qlikview response qlik sense going back root trying reach record line business compete effectively tableau tool list tableau kind going way still think place always fully embraced mean end day balance playing nice part challenge larger company discrete siloed bi deployment pop real risk governance risk data silo risk analytics usually tool usually solves individual need group even individual person based certain level enterprise standardization introduce potentially introduces discrepancy data viewed even metric could different say anything data risk vendor deal within mandeep singh dan vessetwe see lot effort tableau try embrace ensure software enterprise capability around security governance data model management one big unknown right think biggest unknown amazon quicksight surface make lot sense company already data amazon amazon data source could hosted hosted data base lot oracle sql server example hosted amazon question well product actually support end user rather developer part amazon hand approach strategy somebody start using quicksite individual business user business user group run trouble amazon really set kind one one personalized support provide develop vendor also year started provide developer system admin side storage admin side even still highly reliant user figure back ph whatever channel might enter use community kind online community source like big question mark primarily product developer incorporate application obviously nothing wrong sizable market different tableau qlik done date also quicksite quite open somebody subscribe server side engine calculation engine use visualization tool top think scenario see developing well body may already low data amazon may want start using quicksite use platform use tableau top example let see maybe stop actually bottom hour maybe open follow question great sure thank dan thanks nice overview specific question around like full data visualization concept said driven line business rendering old data warehousing technique obsolete company moving away investing data warehousing kind going line business want term whether using smaller vendor like tableau qlik kind maintaining data warehouse obviously yeah think really layer showed map go back slide one still matter still continues mandeep singh dan vessetto need warehouse warehouse changing longer relational big change architecture extend warehouse relational data warehouse technology really effective way integrate data many different source could internal inaudible application could bringing social medium data irt data hadoop cluster example top visualization layer access data information management player also true bypass warehouse go directly visualization tool source system also trend exists vendor example sap oracle keen develop trend owe many enterprise application want see company use embedded bi maybe sitting directly financial system supply chain system area enterprise system chance ask question mark hurd oracle earlier year question posed somewhat along line database application business clearly dominate bi analytics tertiary oracle compare kind border message high level message large vendor deny case response want expose analytics bi application expect continue whether hr application sale marketing crp module analytics likely many depend data warehouse extent data warehouse going away role somewhat diminished many growing fast data set moving type technology often open source technology overall affect obviously growth date warehouse segment market great mean want go whole concept vertical versus horizontal kind layer visualization analytics data sap oracle system use analytics product make lot sense enterprise application given sap oracle visualize easily multiple system could erp crm system different vendor want build analytics layer top able ingest data different system easily aggregate using analytics layer would solution like tableau qlik conducive may still want go like large analytics vendor kind solution qlik tableau think really depend whether want setup managed structured data warehouse part challenge qlik tableau server going hold much data data warehouse kind longitudinal station want multiple quarter year kind longer term mandeep singh dan vessetanalysis data really across full enterprise likely building still building warehouse think layer layer technology stack still place mean think part issue build data warehouse let say oracle let say inaudible data option also use oracle bi tool layer amazon could using right shift example amazon preferred data warehouse bi tool amazon also available case couple year ago would naturally gravitate independent bi vendor think big shift market salesforce example likely core data analyzing salesforce data first foremost marketing customer service data case may begin domain le need data warehouse salesforce way analytics directly accessing data cloud crm application providing necessary analytics bi functionality got mentioned amazon quicksight talk specifically segment 11 billion market amazon quicksight aimed yeah still little bit unclear think targeting visual discovery think also little bit bleeding query dimensional analysis space would replace existing deployment enterprise bi suite gray area obviously segment always clear still visual interface conducive ad hoc visual ad hoc discovery schema route analyst might take data case absolution mean big difference memory system applicable particular question also many olap cube existed somebody cube cube basically determined analyst user able navigate data question part path would go back frustration going begin would require almost completely new development cycle would define requirement would go way add new dataset new data dimension rebuild cube redevelop test deploy time host already onto question part frustration qlik tableau able address nearly bypass whole process quicksight think lot visual mandeep singh dan vessetdiscovery also could develop dash interactive dashboard technology kind maybe little bit light weight sense necessarily ad hoc discovery could view data management type interested looking regular daily basis example weekly basis think substantial part 11 billion potentially could egress see really going directly production reporting site would add also launched machine learning service launch quicksight think make machine learning ai kind bring relevance analytics landscape plan leverage technique analytics play yeah machine learning case would fall advanced analytics category look vendor microsoft machine learning ibm machine learning service amazon two player one application machine running internally automate bi functionality recommendation example appropriate visualization given dataset user ingest import dataset system recommend type analysis would make sense type visualization would make sense eﬃciency gain need le analyst need spend le time manually manipulating setting view want present rest organization kind internal use machine learning somewhat technique artificial intelligence externally machine learning service also available developer data site developing application necessarily build algorithm call service run data machine learning engine amazon microsoft ibm providing expect also grow quite rapidly think also give ibm example watson analytics part ibm kind muddying water around watson largest cloud watson cognitive platform talk lot starting brand product also watson even cognitive functionality watson analytics look surface much like visual discovery analytics product able call apis watson cognitive platform coming think happens really happen right think happen mandeep singh dan vesset mandeep singhso start see machine learning technique applied bi visualization market really disrupt market think bi market exists existed primarily business analyst manipulate data find interesting thing report management take make decision based information sort basic level could anything excel excel pivot table packaged software many case pretty much thing maybe visually appealing past better capability pulling data different source talking high performance et cetera lot still manual manual process getting data manual process finding interesting root cause certain something turning red dashboard kpi let investigate let figure many case applying machine learning cognitive function dataset tell automatically different unusual going market lot le need think next five year start see lot disruption market going le need traditional tool targeting manual process business analyst great thanks take pause remind listener send question take one question listener asking level seeing new age analytic solution like qlik tableau replace legacy solution like cognos business object yeah specific number anecdotally still relatively small percentage lot usually happens quite old version strategy product incremental decision point go jump two three version even sometimes sap product ibm oracle go new vendor oftentimes also triggered change sore ph system maybe change erp crm application may kind rapid growing reliance technology maybe really heavy start reliance social medium data example market scenario whole new dataset large dataset fast scrolling new decision point ass existing need see replacement relatively case case given named company named account large company multiple bi product continue multiple bi product dan vesset mandeep singh dan vessetso would piggyback think like ibm coming watson analytics microsoft launching part bi cannibalizing old analytics solution way incremental think cannibalizing think big part allowing customer wherein past buy suite product multiple module within relatively large initial outlay cash allowing much smaller incremental purchase buy cognos analytics watson analytics piece everything ibm offer past would almost forced buy broader cognos suite know cannibalization certainly price point become smaller given point time hope get volume transaction increase vendor good microsoft good volume somebody like salesforce ibm sap oracle great think big shift could see slow growth fact negative growth bi revenue let move cloud think advantage analytics product one mean know tableau qlik popular consumption still using desktop server product think make sense people kind move towards analytics product broad answer everybody moving cloud right deployment today estimating around maybe 7 5 7 bi market cloud today small compared example happens sale p automation application majority deployment cloud part lack supply said deployment still second half 2015 major vendor came new cloud version tool estimating cloud public cloud part 11 billion market growing 4.5 time faster next five year 4.5 time faster part question moving towards cloud becomes really becomes requirement vendor today product give specific functionally think major advantage given point time think cloud give ability reiterate faster new feature functionality obviously provide quicker cheaper update mandeep singh dan vessetso lot advantage vendor moving cloud part issue short term hit revenue recognition issue kind change happens take three year even revenue assessment forecasting perspective inhibitor growth short term adoption revenue recognition spread negative primarily issue switching one premise great would contrast like different approach large vendor microsoft amazon offering analytic service ﬂash utilization ph tool top cloud infrastructure service whereas ibm yes offering watson analytics also gone purchased weather channel data tied analytics way think rationale yeah think important point calling calling value added content ability analytics content along inaudible company one example amazon mean microsoft partnership twitter another example oracle acquired couple company bluekai one datalogix consumer data business collecting behavioral data purchasing data demographic data kind packaging ph oracle case continuing sell discrete offering also embedding value embedding crm application buy marketing automation marketing analytics also option subscribe data feed individual sometimes usually anonymized individual used analytics think large vendor position already half amazon also make available certain data set marketplace microsoft think going see much prepackaged data set sometimes raw data oftentimes type put data maybe score benchmark go along analytic service really becomes feasible cloud delivery mechanism bank ph another example would well also open competition outside traditional player example intuit provides certain financial solution smbs data service process transaction smbs know people purchasing much spend staple last month region business create create certain data set benchmark mandeep singh dan vesset mandeep singh dan vessetand sometimes monetizing directly sometimes create stickiness customer see type interest credit card company business large retailer becoming everybody trying figure else monetize data sitting package many case within obviously within compliance regulation privacy regulation exists make money clearly major part play ibm case another fact weather key element pretty much decision whether retail insurance physical asset management logistics weather play huge part weather company relationship business domain think opportunity ibm continue expect acquire content source like could increase pressure pure play guy like tableau qlik primarily selling tool veribit acquire content company think overall yes think short term still nimble execute think faster effectively big vendor think symptom large vendor moving slower qlik actually bought one data provider bought company called datamarket relatively small european vendor exists could go way well think next important thing pure play vendor get advanced predictive analytics compete company like saas ibm spss incorporating advanced analytics existing tool set provide recommendation user automate process data acquisition preparation also visualization would expect important kind next step great one last question space getting crowded mean company space continued get new funding altrix another funding round yeah keep hearing analytics visualization think scope consolidation yeah odds far yeah gotten enormous funding like gilmore frankly quite understand see anything quite unique company like burst gooddata others altrix bit different mandeep singh dan vessettarget slightly different base partner qlik tableau focused data preparation advanced analytics besides visible dozen vendor space think always long tail lot movement along vendor first time idc 15 year first time probably 20 year major change top 10 vendor activity qlik moving mean quite tableau moving rank kind surprising vendor tableau ever become top five hard say doubtful think would acquisition think always bunch tiny smaller vendor matter think hard name mentioned mentioned crack top 10 next foreseeable future think also clear reasoning acquisition buy somebody like tableau qlik assuming right valuation lot functionality well known big vendor buying unique ip great clearly easy space understand hope find discussion useful thank much dan time really enjoyed discussion look forward future webinars thank thank
