right think live good afternoon everyone chris caso raymond james semiconductor analyst everyone welcome first semiconductor fireside chat year iic suppose probably everybody saying would prefer orlando rather front computer next year sure happy nvidia u u nvidia cfo colette kress well investor relation simona jankowski stewart stecker welcome everyone thanks coming muted colette make sure sorry still muted colette sorry right give u minute go muted let try hear got quintessential start meeting sorry sure moved thank much nvidia conference agree next year another great year hopefully person christopher caso colette m. kress christopher caso colette m. kress guess would like start u start anything want say work q colette leave however want get u started okay sound great need give quick little reminder everybody presentation discussion may contain statement investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business get way let kind talk finished earnings last week completed q4 full year fiscal year released result truly breakout year u accelerated computing gaming adoption accelerated computing across industry high gear see gaming moved beyond game incorporating esports creatives really social medium u incredible demand geforce rtx 30 series best launch ever kicked powerful upgrade cycle u adoption nvidia accelerated computing continues gather momentum greater urgency across many company digest automate accelerate innovation move forward talk result great finish fiscal year huge guide guided q1 fiscal year well turn back chris question answer well good way start u strong guidance maybe first question going common lot semiconductor company week aspect shortage mind every semiconductor investor right perhaps could tell u nvidia affected shortage would demand better supply dealing sure really think business think really start statement word supply really word demand demand strong demand strong across business launching ampere architecture gaming data center building example overall gaming business building gpus gaming samsung tsmc ability source overall gaming business 2 fabs could pleased great partner u many year allow u produce everything need high end also 300 price point still able produce overall christopher caso colette m. kress christopher caso colette m. kresssupply provider tsmc overall turing architecture end year summary although overall short demand still believe supply deliver continued growth year gaming data center one thing mentioned call also going process launching mainstream series next version ampere 3060 talk supply product well impact go forward april quarter yes let step back talk 30 series correct launched overall gaming gpu 30 series earlier last year huge success probably successful gaming launch rtx stand ray tracing also list 3 dozen game overall ray tracing strong performance improvement 30 series demand amazing started launch product starting several card 3070 3080 3090 market several overall month period time showing capability 30 series true gamers also supporting availability creator broadcaster use expect see 30 series continue launch new product move forward latest product launched 3060 60 class sweet spot sweet spot gamers great performance great price 60 class essentially preferred icafes find asia pac area well many system builder build custom overall system 3060 launch last week sold hour carefully engineered gamers primarily gamers excited ampere architecture 329 great differentiation price point support type gamer depending want come market pay well cost new console mentioned pricing one difference 30 series compared 20 series well launch 3090 higher price point maybe talk disclose asp within maybe speak qualitatively impact card done overall mix within gaming yes start launch architecture card similar last time think well received across market ability ray tracing think important upgrade cycle u see astounding amount performance christopher caso colette m. kress christopher caso colette m. kressimprovement last architecture go back architecture pascal importance pascal term installed base upgrader pascal and/or turing see tremendous performance improvement expansion overall ray trace gain really holiday season truly benefited upgrading well new gamers coming market volume skus 3060 given interest many gamers even volume skus moving 3070 3080 helped u term average asp total revenue whole likely continue see driver u okay good demand strong move back supply side moment talk availability supply particularly go year historically say july quarter little seasonally weaker desktop side go back half year get stronger would imagine thing supply demand ahead supply constraint perhaps seasonality play depends upon availability wafer go along expect get additional wafer year progress yes let step back think talk term end q4 end q4 great holiday season super strength term demand overall correctly channel channel inventory lean level time look overall guide moving q4 q1 seasonality essentially thrown window super strong sequential increase expected q4 q1 gaming working always supply continue get supply throughout q1 well rest year meet demand quite strong seasonality therefore changed q1 probably therefore change think whole rest year see rest year go guide 1 quarter time seasonality seen past probably going able repeat able move overall level channel appropriate level right sound like feel constraint supply mean still may constrained necessarily constrain ability grow level additional supply coming demand still get growth yes absolutely chris course situation would love optionality would love overall supply remember issue demand strong demand strong believe grow quite well demand continue year front u christopher caso colette m. kress christopher caso colette m. kress yes observed looking card retail hard get certainly data go website corroborate saying factor obviously concern investor impact cryptocurrency business right fear cryptocurrency business think said call expecting sort permanent element demand going forward volatile gaming demand maybe could talk view step taking control risk yes step back understand crypto understand crypto currency time around environment different different last cycle first gaming architecture 30 series early ramp versus early stage transition took placed back 2018 discussed channel lean 30 series right secondly keep mind reducing overall mining performance latest 60 series gpu announced cmp board specifically miner announced cmp board felt saw demand professional miner would good opportunity u restart cmp program thirdly etherium mining increase occurred shared lot different overall driver remember established installed base ethereum time around versus 2018 also seeing new asics part lot hashing occurring multiple gpu provider time quarter gaming example probably would without crypto supply constrained continue watch believe cmp product allow u better visibility understanding size crypto within quarter could go back within 2018 20 cycle release mining specific board time also say aggressive approach actually 3060 suppose take step higher end 30 series card safe say going forward one strategy employ segment crypto part gaming part market make sure gaming card get gamers crypto address like yes correct announced cmp program start shipping march time frame additionally 3060 came opportunity u allow available gamers build geforce gamers took additional step reduce hash rate eﬃciency christopher caso colette m. kress christopher caso colette m. kressnew launch 3060 see need take step 30 series card launched last fall crypto mining really happening far back support gamers support gamers geforce really create cmp card professional miner see next quarter update everybody quarter term saw term cryptocurrency cmp ask one gaming operator instruction far gaming general suppose one market segment could say one home beneficiary next room definitely evidence term exceptional demand seeing gaming deal potential risk go outside thing demand tail yes look perspective gaming moved gaming continued grow entertainment social medium also served important connection many u last year perfect virtual safe option entertainment anything believe past year accelerated discovery gaming growth preferred entertainment social medium time expect continued growth occur even thing possibly get better people able thing social medium hooked gaming hooked friend overall social aspect gaming going really diﬃcult turn back still think great opportunity expose people overall gaming see overall demand expect continue work home great well attest winning fortnite match son probably best bonding opportunity covid think go back pivot data center data center growing modest growth seen gaming least short term long term maybe talk business going extent data center business
