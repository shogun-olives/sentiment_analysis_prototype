skin green sorry skin green yeah maybe know find afterwards huh right go ahead get started aaron rakers semiconductor hardware analyst well fargo extremely excited host discussion colette kress cfo nvidia start though colette going throw little fact right 10 year actually september anniversary point joined company 4 billion revenue trailing 12 month 45 billion roughly right market cap gone 9 billion 1.2 trillion going start saying good work congrats phenomenal run keep going take foot pedal start question collette think get joy reading safe harbor think might prepared comment well kick colette kress sound great thank aaron u opening statement let first say reminder presentation contains statement investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business okay enjoy coming event let kind start thing seeing nvidia last part year important time important time related really change see data center computing going forward rise generative ai really created new paradigm front u see accelerated computing ai computing thrust lot computing going forward enormous installed base right 1 trillion compute type last several decade opportunity people see sustainability move forward eﬃcient way computing also transact using ai ai u almost everything statement say beginning journey huge opportunity front u look forward come yes gave earnings right thanksgiving holiday show strong growth sequentially growth company across market platform standout course data center compute data center compute reached record level training inferencing also gpu sale system also networking reaching customer every day term work strength stem consumer internet company lot enterprise let forget csps also growing last quarter continuing see specialized regional csps also grow wanted start beginning statement turn back aaron question answer colette kress q aaron rakers colette kress q aaron rakers colette kress question answer perfect going got know 50 question going try get many inevitable question always get fiscal 1q look like think know answer maybe start kind help u characterize balance imbalance say current supply demand environment nvidia think dynamic lead time skus start progress think progressing move forward important look last year ability scale company size revenue folk really looking must easy process took lot work working many supply channel ordering supply keep mind also ordering capacity relationship really helpful u able scale fast unfortunately still though going take u little yet u catch plan term scaling supply year quarter also plan go making meaningful progress term catching supply many folk look ordering seeing inventory keep mind much many different duration duration term need today also procuring solidifying capacity term long term track next year make meaningful progress right term supply demand time serving demand also bringing new product market new product market therefore surfaced onset demand coming next set product know talk yeah perfect know mentioned right like like add purchase commitment inventory prepaid capacity like grew 40 sequentially last quarter point would expect continue grow sequentially next handful quarter correct q aaron rakers colette kress q aaron rakers colette kress kind away supply side demand side guess view visibility changed demand visibility see demand shaping second piece question think last quarter talked last week talked little bit product cycle cadence product cycle important variable consider product visibility maybe help u appreciate little bit think back time many different architecture generation gone seeing today relationship customer grown stronger stronger relationship come helping think plan build term data center longstanding discussion help u work exact configuration need also help u demand visibility work continues every day think long would take build data center beginning day one planning standing likely year team built data center already seeing work begin term next year want build bringing together existing portfolio new portfolio product coming build relationship demand go forward continue process visibility strong talk visibility one customer knowing supply knew help u plan needed provide u deep understanding essentially po perspective continue path right new product maintain process understanding demand yeah finer point look slide deck put investor relation website kind outline cadence product cycle right look like le year cadence whereas past might much longer cadence part visibility discussion customer asking kind cadence product cycle fair correct additionally market advanced much complexity type ai solution folk working would love see something new new plan q aaron rakers colette kress q aaron rakers colette kressand u work different product even architecture well architecture going forward faster cadence helpful helpful planning also support new project perfect shifting gear little bit competitive landscape often get question one competitor launch product next week seems narrative around like hyperscale cloud guy know aws trainium 2 week announcement seen microsoft announced recently characterize competitive landscape seeing data center think work done still step back help folk understand build specific product build chip built full stack built many time full data center data center computing minute information data enters data center work nvidia nvidia system nvidia networking nvidia overall software stack full system software really close application get help people build model help people correct model work competitive hard look anything apple term different specific chip may help certain specific workload reason customer continue turn u tco saving purchasing full stack require significant amount resource would add top received chip work continues u help support tco effort think type solution coming market great position merrier fine know tco going goal many customer today lot time field question cuda 4.8 million developer stack much deeper right think tend get lost cuda stickiness fair assessment much cuda layer think onset cuda cuda development platform every single one gpus close 15 year building strong development platform community joined development platform everything gpus today compatible every customer know changed generation architecture new generation everything still working q aaron rakers colette kresswe also think would development community like like developer much work built time somebody would rebuild position full solution one overall argue understand continue innovate going forward count u next year yes going thinking new product market well want go layer stack strategy minute networking software definitely want touch go wanted ask china restriction recent round know last week mentioned look going solution adhere restriction selling china within month also mentioned though china contribution would unquote significantly quarter help u think cadence like kind take full china business expectation quarter start see come back solution come market think next quarter two u.s. export control time quite detailed quite long took really thinking move forward help china customer china still big market u much industry whole look export control carefully go option would approve new set area say notify review government area say carry fine china want make sure understanding relationship u.s. government remains solid created great understanding need want make sure following keep mind china customer want well bring new product want know u.s. government also agrees working right term design think could certainly talk u.s. government make sure also aligned given unknown defined time correct looking part provided outlook q4 sequential decline see china keep mind still selling gaming business still bill part data center business sell term would significant change quarter going forward support china approval understanding u.s. government q aaron rakers colette kress q aaron rakers colette kress q aaron rakers colette kress dialogue round relative restriction oriented first kind restriction dialogue u.s. government changed deepened far engagement solution fall threshold restriction given complexity market given complexity semiconductor whole complexity ai yes much thorough discussion side yes far cadence said month right far new solution china market working fast got okay let go stack little bit topic written lot given coverage universe networking business think people really starting see significance put context bought mellanox business running 1.3 billion revenue think math remotely right 2.6 billion even 2.7 billion revenue networking know jensen endorsed 10 billion plus annualized revenue last quarter help u appreciate little bit first want know much infiniband going get see evolving far even deepening networking strategy yeah great question regarding networking time completed acquisition one thing know match culture match culture term team worked innovation thinking future would really basis data center computing similar done pleased term well acquisition helped solution customer partnership across many peer israel work correct reached annual run rate nearly 10 billion term networking looking sizable amount together selling gpu system selling network together q aaron rakers colette kress q aaron rakers colette kressthey look networking solution accelerated computing also ai solution ai training inferencing importance infiniband standard large cluster key infiniband also grown even faster total networking business large customer using installing throughout important part process building data center need also understand ethernet accelerated computing ai also key coming new calendar year high speed moving key based ethernet ethernet important enterprise type data center know important piece going able really manage industry colette debate infiniband ethernet ethernet replace infiniband look accretive business either play different piece ai stack think lot white paper talk delineates ai factory versus ai cloud seems like might delineation ethernet versus infiniband maybe help u understand one play accretive model absolutely accretive taken away infiniband standard many opening ethernet addition term key place true think ai factory standardize versus standardize example supercomputer built ai thinking traﬃc coming data center particularly large inferencing platform traﬃc traﬃc mitigation infiniband new really really really work manage traﬃc challenge may yes perfect q1 come announced partnership dell server ecosystem okay great kind sticking product portfolio announcement week aws first deployer think gh200 grace hopper combination cpu hopper gpu talk little bit fit strategy grace hopper look like start think piece product portfolio going forward q aaron rakers colette kress q aaron rakers colette kresscorrect came grace hopper 200 started shipping within q3 q3 many supercomputer design win begun shipping grace hopper200 amazon aws ec2 set important also take create full supercomputer dedicated able keep 32 gpus together working well new revised nvlink within yet new product introduction excited work aws standing first gh200 csp also opportunity working u dgx cloud gh200 well working customer software solution using gh200 great opportunity using grace cpu also complete faster performance whole term going grace hopper gh200 gh300 whatever subsequent version might look like grace market cpu nvidia opportunity grace opportunity grace new product scenario could see data center likely see opportunity grace well perfect want shift software something also written lot think reason writing hear becoming vocal right talked last quarter pace hit 1 billion arr walk u software monetization nvidia like big driver certainly question walk u key driver software side talk software important reason people choose stack success work successful year software building software come every gpu even though foreseen part invoice say provide term free important work new opportunity u look software monetization well reason work enterprise true end customer enterprise around world shape size work q aaron rakers colette kress q aaron rakers colette kresswhen building accelerated solution ai need help likely staffed significant amount software engineer software stack essential essential thing already work structure could also turn u term help assistance fixing model optimizing model additional work new project may able enterprise focused term seeing ai computing frame see computing data center important software leverage work vmware enterprise leverage vmware manage operate data center different workload key u key part see data center future becoming big portion accelerated ai enterprise looking solution say accountable keeping software providing security platform create trusting relationship monetizes something actually sell piece nvidia aie software platform essentially ai operating system enterprise big part software probably going forward different component well omniverse key component let forgot forget av software automotive u thing scale type customer infrastructure people install infrastructure operating system important important use think 1 billion arr year fair say overwhelming majority unless want give number think overwhelming majority aie ai enterprise software today lot different piece associated going data center lot different data center component interesting think consumption model cloud partner look got oracle microsoft azure google week dgx aws well consumed cloud partner consumed traditional enterprise infrastructure yeah great thing consumed almost every form channel think term going odm dell hp going cloud credit work cloud q aaron rakers colette kress q aaron rakers colette kress q aaron rakers colette kress q aaron rakerscustomers download software term opportunity procure software making easy integration pretty much get lot different place cloud guy price per gpu per hour correct fast model look somewhere range 4,500 5,000 per year per gpu type load somewhere range looking okay asked many time conference call stuff one metric guy talk cloud service agreement number internal usage lot might internal usage right always looking leading indicator software side actually potential payment cloud partner infrastructure software actually fair assessment cloud service agreement like every enterprise cloud service agreement serve many different us ability stand cloud understand enterprise facing using test software test future solution work new use case product time right centered around internal use building dgx cloud established space within csps customer coming enterprise say like dgx cloud move across multiple different csps one almost help quickly come market product solution two real quick software side omniverse want say memory right kind initially introduced back latter part timeframe maybe year old know remember progression software piece take little bit longer significant change colette kress q aaron rakers colette kress q aaron rakers colette kress great progress already term seeing omniverse working large manufacturing factory type build importance work need redesign and/or initially design one factory eﬃciency using omniverse clearly many large car company car manufacturer really looking omniverse help see almost type factory built industrial type factory warehousing redesign ability create complete digital twin existing and/or future without going full prototype building making large error using omniverse environment happens every day type us come omniverse add many different prescription need work always going added continuous evolution 3d type view versus 2d used much term design build essential yes pleased progress continue see future final thing software automotive still thinking like mercedes ﬂagship jaguar land rover ﬂagship 2025 2026 timeframe absolutely busy working yes expect pilot start also full ﬂeet company got 3.5 minute left going maybe rapid fire couple quick question mix huge driver business think gross margin go mean remarkable right 75 gross margin think trajectory gross margin seems like data center mix continue go higher software going layer top think yeah think gross margin although important metric many u p l keep mind capture everything talk asp think actual manufacturing cost really manufacturing cost included work term designing software many and/or full engineering work many solution keep giving even q aaron rakers colette kress q aaron rakersshipped product easily get represented still opec metric important metric 75 given size data center business seeing company margin data center margin kind seeing company total mostly data center believe level stay continuation point probably software software adding think pretty much seeing data center one perfect quick question want ask actually last quarter 18 plus billion cash balance sheet think everybody look model say guy going generate lot cash think strategic like platform strategy mellanox home run obviously armed play think balance strategic maybe platform expanding activity company yeah say first stepping back cash allocation top priority make sure think right avenue want apply cash always going first investment back business whether capital back whether opex investing business innovation right first going number one use cash secondly want make sure investor get portion want make sure dilution associated equity provide employee equity employee important important part compensation want keep dilution ﬂat possible look term investment every single day investment learn many company term work also working company opportunity hard found perfect mellanox past think would easy find new environment term right environment mean still look look term smaller company team bringing unique ad company would something look time got literally 12 second left 10 going ask one pointed question talk hundred investor earnings right earnings end go something else continual ﬂywheel discussion surprised people asking topic like man surprised getting question would colette kress q aaron rakers colette kress surprise question getting well would look goal term earnings reason talk like make sure clarity product clarity term accelerating computing growth important part u believe question mainly surround little bit detail wo add gotten clear understanding generative ai significant change focus enterprise around world focusing building ai solution enterprise enterprise look say future using enterprise ai otherwise able compete market pretty big market go work important think focus sovereign ai come forth folk asked mean probably important key understanding speaking u.s. see chatgpt chatgpt u.s. culture u.s. data u.s. way think every nation and/or region want thing also know would therefore proprietary data information well speak many different enterprise work right add ai working many region also build need collette time appreciate joining u morning thank much thank
