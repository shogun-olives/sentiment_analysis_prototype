good afternoon thank joining u first scotiabank tech conference really glad everybody thrilled participation even thrilled stage name steve sparkes ciso head enterprise infrastructure scotiabank joined today grannis excellent excellent excellent individual around get q prepared going read mandatory safe harbor statement benefit everyone safety statement mr. grannis may make today could considered fact actually hope many could considered statement involve number risk uncertainty actual result could differ materially please refer alphabet form including risk factor section grannis steve sparkes q steve sparkes grannisany statement mr. grannis make based assumption today alphabet undertakes obligation update end safe harbor statement like tell little bit know lucky enough interaction year really thrilled today chief technology oﬃcer google cloud team tech exec engineer helping get cloud business almost nine year almost nine year early day cloud u seen google invested substantially cloud make powerhouse platform big part joining google entrepreneur tech exec number different sector finance although obviously particular sweet spot today developer engineering leader still close tech ceo director past graduated west point jumped bunch plane landed bunch people lived tell tale question answer today going get hear little bit see thing developing kick little bit background role encompass cto cloud great well certainly honor steve great see great excuse bump role cloud lead team q steve sparkes grannisthere two thing number one top customer partner moving cloud help navigate first step complex pattern adoption around world every geography every part stack way customer really interested optimizing infrastructure way saas everything platform example three four year ago customer asking u create natural language interface document sound familiar based recent event period course year worked customer take best research developing google product developing google helped realize potential technology imagine working top customer across every industry every geography also learned quite thing second part take emerging pattern start testing year kind new product strategy new entry road map based signal receive market customer work example work unilever around sustainable sourcing palm oil converted bigger push around sustainability google cloud includes climate risk analytics apis google produce data common get massive access climate data simple api two branch work one best part job getting spend time customer see implementation real world really applied team care making technology useful fantastic degree customer engagement cto scale team grown mean running 30 billion run rate heck growth story world grown support yes well think since q3 2019 added roughly 24 billion annualized run rate different business year ago history back roughly nine year ago kind first wave cloud google starting create pathway technology world second wave creating kind platform would allow industry customer geo solve problem really scale phase got ecosystem rapidly growing 100,000 partner ecosystem today almost implementation inaudible regional technology partner ecosystem help implementation planning training rest team really looked like making sure customer getting leverage technology guess could kind break stack want cloud kind think platform company organization achieve goal digital transformation critical mission start bottom kind think typical stack infrastructure today 39 region globally example commitment 2030 operate entirely energy powering data center build pretty much making sure access compute ubiquitous also sustainable energy consideration weigh people mind sustainability weighs company mind move stack little bit second part kind differentiated cloud put really around data ai see google legacy quite bit really showing making data accessible useful supercritical cost many customer want customer want want data make easily useful building experience customer refining process internally want constrained choice single vendor example thing done year bigquery anybody actually heard bigquery one hallmark technology okay great saw handful technology conference great see bigquery 2020 released capability called bigquery omni bigquery omni allows sically computes binary inside cloud like amazon microsoft allows send query across cloud want without egress data bring back bring result back imagine important company data store multiple cloud instead deal cost egress complex technical bit solved product call bigquery omni next layer stack kind platform layer q steve sparkes grannisthen move got call security cloud comprehensive security infrastructure security also application security brought ton new capability one mandiant round threat mitigation consulting also virus total chronicle number capability year able characterize threat reduce threat surface across entire enterprise kind moving towards top collaboration cloud want think like infrastructure platform infrastructure data ai security collaboration get work done create workﬂows exist company example sort like workspace really interesting ai bringing market year ai cascading kind like thread run infrastructure data platform way saas think since minute specifically hit generative ai really must yes yes exactly put least another couple dollar think probably worth starting foundational think think gen ai different vanilla ai call let talk bit foundational benefit need place gen ai take sure let see take inaudible generative ai inaudible okay let try way traditional ai going way okay right traditional ai really teaching machine look pattern using create like classifier predictor includes work around neural network last 10 year lot classical application think machine vision category car need teach machine understand traﬃc pattern obstacle look like come contact generative ai generative ai really ai system creating content creating data similar data trained example ask ask chat application today write poem really understand guess people would argue really understand artistic bit poultry create content based similarity word used word used conjunction token word broken token would comprise word poetry q steve sparkes grannisso way generative ai kind extension build foundation neural network creating content thinking predicting next word actually creating next word creating image think one challenge u point begin hallucinate control sort error rate talked little bit morning keynote legal example lawyer fell foul trusted chatgpt output despite saying `` really telling truth course lie think one thing thinking business leader embrace power time control confidence make misstep well opinion experience really approaching full stack comprehensive approach mean design principle behind google cloud approach ai offering complete ai stack mean mean research go novel technique mean processor others semiconductor chip design optimization spend lot time also spent lot time tooling machine learning ops significant burden gen ai ops significant burden organization also take upon create platform allows people without even knowing code start journey generative ai also kind go top stack like spoke want give collaborator even operating saas like workspace like know like small business maybe started dog walking business still time f aspiration good news generative ai help express desire like `` hi really want track client know get started give call duet ai ai collaborator give duet ai intent generate tracking spreadsheet typical column typical field trying run business example without think structural component get started many way top stack getting started getting value without architect also brought duet ai platform example let say using bigquery hope still time bigquery really matter matter analytics system structuring good query want run right amount data want query well structured kind overshoot data costly kind run without bound duet ai gcp example google cloud platform capability within bigquery give recommended query question throughout stack company looking get started one kind marrying strategy able find place stack want build foundational model care lot like example google care lot ability tune infrastructure give optionality like tpu v5e anthropic published week using ten thousand chip cluster care lot eﬃciency going speed market also want break bank could also looking gpus host nvidia range even published made available a3 supercomputer machine shape get ten thousand nvida h100s available run extensive workload imagine company organization really want innovate need infrastructure optionality need partner really understands deep optimization infrastructure layer maybe company like `` know going take foundational model exist going take data going combine create competitive advantage need platform tier call vertex google cloud vertex allows without even code need know code go console find latest model whether one google find llama two find model cohere antrophic others model garden get started combining foundation model data well like well get data going well technology within vertex allows point indexer structured unstructured data code pointing data source index imagine work regardless background room know produce content produce insight also gather knowledge structure way actually one key barrier using data refine foundational model structuring whether going bring like q steve sparkes grannis q steve sparkes grannisembedding like spatial relationship data going use knowledge graph getting point quickly really really important provide vertex mentioned earlier like want see stuff really sure kick tire yet use duet ai get immediate value generative ai speeding workﬂow getting image presentation many people room make presentation raise hand lying right make presentation one key thing workﬂow like let say trying convey concept illustration image well go find perfect one exist actually slows considerably workﬂow creating content also concept online marketer right want go put content need image specific appropriate copyright right legal right way really speeding kind workﬂow company get started like picking strategy picking spot stack yes think mentioned access vast amount compute obviously prerequisite model generation think one weird thing moment past see startup emerging challenging incumbent case incumbent actually access raw material whether data compute really model garden route probably way see startup emerging wondering think making available capacity emergent company feel like significant barrier entry moment well really interesting seeing traditional enterprise organization startup succeed generative ai give kind view path somebody like deutsche bank small european competitor yes know wanted point q steve sparkes grannis heard yes able synthesize internal content mentioned document content analyst inside organization really quick way express question idea natural language interface corpus data document get reasonable result back quickly enough spend time refining past probably would faster human go cascade bunch search like write stuff put content pace speed platform like vertex allows index create spatial relationship representation data fast enough workﬂow analyst reviewing content internally produced using synthesize potentially new analysis customer health care another kind big traditional enterprise many dealt health care system kind classic enterprise issue around innovation company like hca healthcare using generative ai live transcription doctor go back desk type note get live patient spend time care traditional organization getting benefit speech text natural language capability generative ai today startup perspective experience startup founder ceo also kind big company person well startup usually seeded people really really specific knowledge specific problem advantage speed lot seeing right startup success mentioned anthropic earlier cohere ai21 lab lot organization get scaled ai optimized compute u focus solving business problem idea like someone want put chatbot view like responsible chatbot alternative focus guardrail want put output look like want generate going get basically ai supercomputer take care lot way speeding startup ability get first article first output tune much much faster q steve sparkes grannis q steve sparkes point exposing generative ai content consumer one thing super thoughtful scotia one colleague grace lee lead data analytics team spent ton time data ethic program acutely sensitive appropriate treatment form data particular consumer data got human loop gen ai program use case moment got bright line yet crossed exposing generative ai content consumer base wondering across broader client base serve seeing risk appetite check balance client may putting place make sure end user befall worst characteristic gen ai well responsible ai something opinion associated google way 2017 put first version ai principle using ai production scale year way bumped lot issue early developing guidance hope constantly evolving hope helpful organization size product people technology people engineer technologist always thinking customer get leverage knowledge experience example mentioned vertex ai platform one capability vertex includes responsible ai filter get added run generative model inside platform actually give customer preview potential brand toxicity issue might come output send next stage workﬂow may sound like little thing create filter ability create kind sliding scale organization decide decide much want push boundary brand safety within industry competitiveness type content want allow even getting place codify slider bar set really really important keep embedding responsible ai platform customer benefit kind automation tooling way scale versus consistently human overlooking every single thing point need leverage technology yes one thing finding great augmentation task talked earlier opportunity transcription rapid digesting data really seeing displacement actual role entirety think see side kick grannisaid intelligent partner people knowledge worker activity day absolutely era building data product centered product product undergrad linear algebra never cool feel like back like winter cool really interesting accessibility advanced capability created layer stack mean computation one reason neural network took prominently roughly 8 9 10 year ago computational eﬃciency place could reasonably start run network scale created kind first wave second wave generative ai kind made ai accessible matter business finance part company get benefit ai convert kind natural language way interfacing rationalizing world computer language machine language pretty profound think duet ai tell trying accomplish surface spreadsheet creating slide presentation even within operation application cloud help guide eﬃcient query hi maybe using wrong size disc based io property application maybe overspent maybe ought look different shape really accessing data often maybe look archival storage versus running kind hot performance storage time little thing start really add working one customer gaming industry really interested concept digital concierge meeting leadership team really fascinating used presentation like ceo cto cio would go give presentation like stuff everybody would like wow seems like really weird lot math lot computer lot network lot stuff really relevant lot kind like experience building lot business trying one thing generative ai done kind broken silo function allowed people participate creation digital concierge creation experience customer guess one experience ai really eye opener working nasa like `` hi intern like intern productive summer. `` like cool okay literally like sleep ﬂoor run job q steve sparkes grannis q steve sparkes grannis q steve sparkes grannislooking planet looking explants particular group like sleep ﬂoor machine job run may stall work time really sad intern providing hosted notebook small gpu attached orchestrated kubernetes cloud could kind like scale scale discovered whole bunch exo planet without sleep ﬂoor oﬃce happier intern scientific discovery groundbreaking new discovery science providing kind simple platform ai mean era right right well going bring back something immediate concern use ai look security hole see arm race threat actor using ai find hole defender plug okay let see domain area little bit right big cecl going try best need help statement never made okay think like 10.5 trillion kind cyber crime annualized basis yes really big deal least try helpful moment talking one making sure comprehensive security application program customer entrust google cloud example security command center integrates lot telemetry coming used kind would know extremely well steve kind application deal security different part stack like endpoint security application security network security one thing done google cloud deployed thing called security command center kind wrapper give telemetry every layer stack application way q steve sparkesinfrastructure really important threat actor capable constantly changing tactic telemetry data log actually super important tool evolve foundation data really important creating lot telemetry even importantly opinion gaining u leverage created model like 2 take expertise google threat group take telemetry log event pretty surprise pretty big target well cyber event take take data train foundational model case palm 2 pathway language model 2 kind bring security angle combine data two model available customer google cloud bring already kind tuned domain use observation telemetry data refine create even new capability within organization may even differentiated firm level entirely new form leverage definitely focused cybersecurity mentioned one foundational layer stack google cloud mandiant addition really threat action gave u insight anybody deal allowed raise hand steve anybody deal malware detection threat job yes may know yara kind framework language around malware identification threat detection like new programming line like different language completely one thing inside security console used two create summary malware event threat mitigation remediation natural language cybersecurity professional understand semantics nuance yara actually get started threat understanding threat remediation mean mean leveling security capability organization tooling people opinion biggest risk lack cybersecurity skill available advanced cybersecurity skill available going need leverage tool platform going need folk capability without 10 15 year experience would typically need operate level even summary quickly orient people remediation could save real workﬂow term mean could save hour day week threat curation next right hour day week really count rate exploit accelerating constantly time shave detection remediation grannis q steve sparkescycle incredibly valuable past might try use simulation follow conventional learning methodology able address lower level stack absolutely value add sure one threat one opportunity threat interested welcome opinion use gen ai platform seen talking mike earlier acceleration commit time impressive want quote number case sensitive certainly double digit percentage acceleration time release code conversely risk inappropriate code injected process something else concerned wonder firstly extent within team using augmented development technique secondly protecting risk code completion code generation understanding providence certain code bit foundational working year google show couple different way one partner like replan one successful ides integrated development environment developer ten million developer right using model underneath hood help developer cogeneration code completion really really speeding thing even within let say gcp environment using development environment duet come back play mentioned earlier example around workspace like slide sheet also duet help code understanding addition completion generation ever developer showed organization told `` hi go check code base tell mean felt significant amount panic pain immediately trying find intent design principle code intended actually take really long time one capability really excited duet kind underpins u understanding code summarizing code trying nexstar annual conference showed example duet able create summary code intended also able look case like risky dependency outdated framework thing also kind help refactoring yes former programmer recovered say amplify thought pity poor people read code try figure long time ago let go back little bit earlier talked capability omni bigquery omni across think obviously thing evaluating embracing grannis q steve sparkesso common lot organization got hybrid environment got bunch compute still data still got footprint data compute multiple cloud maybe spend moment thinking bigquery omni example would say collaboration opportunity horizontal capability extend across multiple cloud thinking taking best advantage beyond omni think spend lot time customer job role coming google enterprise large organization like startup find problem go try solve realize scale inside large organization always start business problem trying solve really dictate view organization example disaster recovery continuity operation one form potential may decide best interest want run want data store across multiple cloud meet regulatory requirement coop dr purpose may also decide bunch data different cloud even laptop data center may decide want optionality maybe converge one big data lake data ocean data universe know next something like alloy db omni released earlier year postgresql database run laptop run data center run cloud run across people cloud continuation thread want consistency implementation architecture want right time make choice constrain number cloud hybrid even laptop tool making available database analytical tool run across different service without commit convergence event way think want business problem trying solve drive think seeking solution match business imperative rather saying tenant onto try project solution yes think really interesting look shoot lowest common denominator find really terrific company multi support particular security operation line thinking concourse lab operate across multiple cloud see clear distinction company deliberately aimed outset support capability versus sort incubated one grudgingly accepted grannis q steve sparkes grannispeople going multiple cloud obliged support multiple different platform well choice technologist want solve problem quickly possible least friction thread actually run mean rewind clock eight nine year google cloud history see earliest beginning surfacing tensor flow open source framework machine learning see kubernetes container orchestration see omni version data analytics data store see across apogee api management capability mean consistent drumbeat demonstration principle open giving choice even extended generative ai era pick model pick workﬂow right pick data store want bring model safely environment without expose continuous drumbeat choice core dna google google cloud yes partnership engagement model one think keen even slightly group dedicated figuring drive partnership bring selection criterion use little bit probably biggest mentioned kind three wave business kind making sure engineering primitive making sure could serve every geo every customer breadth platform scale phase making sure like scale customer scale without roadblock ecosystem grown considerably mean 100 said early ca say actually pretty big change 100,000 partner ecosystem google cloud range independent software vendor use capability kind ride channel software deployment like workday sap docusign also consulting company integrator help solve problem company already relationship organization trust built year want continue leverage preferred partner made available deloitte accenture wipro thousand ten thousand trained individual google q steve sparkes granniscloud ready help solve problem deep implementation problem maybe want looking maybe mainframe modernization looking problem typically complex multiyear involve integrator involve potentially cloud provider involve type situation work capable moving quickly kind continue kind entire industry also spent enormous amount time training 100,000 machine learning course world sponsored brought world google google cloud hundred thousand practitioner kind world understand ai machine learning google cloud think real business benefit organization scale right implementation complex need happen period longer period time really deep understanding business industry geography nuance regulatory concern rest launched like sovereign cloud europe launched partnership two large partner help u kind manage behalf country operate yes one thing fascinated see phil venables built ciso practice within google cloud known phil long time weighing back goldman day morgan stanley goldman always healthy competitive tension cyber arena always cooperation built risk practice ultimately became ciso google cloud curious much time spend hearing threat like build capability defend vice versa go knock door say `` hi something ought taking advantage well like imagine organization relationship cto ciso grown close google google cloud year go back something like 2 creating model union domain expertise knowledge telemetry someone like phil would dealing basis complex policy get embedded response guidance model might give content might generate also like technical underpinnings platform infrastructure computation make feasible operate creating duet ai capability inside security console summarize threat come near real time actually computationally complex intensive process phil want sweat technical infrastructure q steve sparkes grannisand would poor job describing detail nuance security concern role yes awesome curious based everything seen everything know going thing looking forward next sort bearing mind safe harbor statement necessarily google product next six month year getting excited three thing happening right extremely interested excited many way think reﬂects cloud market reset ai era number one list company today brieﬂy talked almost every industry every size almost every use case imagine access created advanced computation really really staggering two daughter 21 17 school various school college high school right able utilize generative ai sometimes authorization sometimes without authorization next generation find way around leveraging tool asking question getting answer access like world knowledge way distilled synthesized like try ask 5,000 question raising kid know give getting answer first second question like democratization access advanced computation seen career happening way feel almost invisible really easy use happening kind individual level massive wave discovery happening following alphafold second generation alphafold already dramatic impact think building block life treatment could envisioned might envisioned future precision medicine example something excited mentioned scientific discovery outside planet thing exoplanets well heard organization called b612 foundation went took computational tool ai went found asteroid old data anything new new telemetry found asteroid using first version like literally look image use expert try figure whether constitute asteroid finding found hundred quick period time think ramification able characterize potential existential threat way future profound also kind third one think lot medicine space q steve sparkes grannis q steve sparkesbut also last week deepmind google released way characterizing crystal structure million new simulated crystalline structure might someday power next wave development artificial crystal semiconductor solar power rest pace cadence discovery quick rapid met wonderful place get see convergence research computational realism organization might dozen people output organization 10x 20x size really incredible time technologist really think also time u consider unique characteristic company sell produce think going facing question gen ai deal lot basic toil knowledge worker task going like calculator let people focus value add make u stupid time lose ability innovate friction toil actually creates struggle create new idea innovation think going know answer one little going amazing journey want thank much time today real pleasure steve thanks well thanks everybody
