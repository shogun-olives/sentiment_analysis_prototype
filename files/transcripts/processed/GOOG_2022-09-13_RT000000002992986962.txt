steadily many quarter strong comparison market growth whole closing cloud market early stage highly differentiated product multiple product line bringing market large focused scaled organization also work broad network partner seeing large expansion business u combination led u show customer adoption traction also strong financial momentum thank q eric sheridan thomas kurian q eric sheridan thomas kurianquestions answer question answer thank thomas thanks term update scale momentum building google cloud really appreciate love start taking step back lot evolved last year industry level within cloud space within google cloud give u world view sit cloud adoption usage see google cloud position within framework yes great question thank eric look last three year cloud adoption changed variety way people looking three year ago talk large customer would say cybersecurity probably place would use cloud data sure would use cloud seeing major trend new segment product line opportunity opening u many customer use u along cloud almost everybody look open huge market u third speed project getting done increasingly many company adopting rather approach invested heavily product ecosystem bring solution customer seeing significant interest partner want build solution top cloud take market morning example announced variety different partnership data area example thing thing seeing increasingly getting traction okay given macro environment remains uncertain experienced prolonged recession downturn since cloud computing scaled industry aside went covid think potential outcome public cloud spend resiliency within broader enterprise ap budget potential landscape going comment macro think audience people far sophisticated macro environment change term trend driving cloud adoption continue play extraordinary role macro environment right instance much cloud computing provides infrastructure rather traditional model operation offer example managed service managed database managed data warehouse managed analytic tool give people ability shift people managing machine project also allows q eric sheridan thomas kurian q eric sheridanorganizations maybe people constrained actually get project done thing like managing machine device third thing lot capability offer could get form fashion example help lot organization managing demand forecasting supply chain visibility predictive capability machine learning tool let offering substitute something people could get way offering new capability really important factor always investing managing think play well direction see adoption technology sticking direction minute maybe bring back investment laid lot opportunity organization think aligning capital investment opportunity see feedback thinking profitability earning return investment good question make look investment primarily three area different time horizon capital investment data center global network machine et cetera typically looking horizon typically order 8 10 year investing building region country something response large addressable market typically making investment 8 10 year horizon second organization early build organization lot customer right started funding organization acquire customer seen strong adoption technology customer number sale people working existing revenue generating client opposed working greenfield account change eﬃciency salesforce second piece product matured product last three year become real player investment make adding product adding feature product always response either customer segment opening new addressable market like compliance need even matured product portfolio building incremental capability baseline lift u lot point view investment eﬃciency confident obviously work closely leadership team proud would investing absolute clarity ruth sundar rest leadership team path profitability thomas kurian q eric sheridan thomas kuriangreat understood recently announced first region mexico think infrastructure footprint scaling time much driven growth see ahead versus need localization much localization driven regulatory pressure around thing like data like data privacy performance end user lot decision investment cloud region also based invest cloud region looking multiple factor one total addressable market local market second demand multinational company want serve local market large number global company customer base many say consider market tell u example market would really like present technology consideration example latency regulatory consideration example government may prefer strongly require data remains within boundary country depending parameter make decision decision also guided investment function build cloud region also know monetize sticking theme talked little bit earlier sale force productivity scaling sale force google cloud spent lot time optimizing strategy aligning organization broader vision since took leadership talk look like today manage manage think sale force productivity utilizing partner versus maybe owned organically disciplined focused growth strategy organization taking consumer company building real enterprise business almost one else start focusing certain country market every year added incrementally wanted get first depth certain country market rather spread wide step one second specialized specialized three different way specialized product category example look buying cybersecurity tool buyer typically chief information security oﬃcer necessarily cio look people buying analytics data platform sometimes department many case example case study done wall street journal work ups actually head logistics second thing specialized salesforce also specialized industry recently example announced creation public sector subsidiary focused selling government agency specialize q eric sheridan thomas kurian q eric sheridanindustry different industry unique need lastly sell traditional technology traditional organization enterprise well company born cloud people call digital native way engage different done work built focus team focused partner partner complement u help u accelerate growth help deploy solution super clear play partner play great success growing ecosystem partner around u frankly many partner find u one easy company work grown substantial business u great okay google long seen differentiated product think data analytics ai machine learning see demand type product evolving see primary driver growth part market important thing see got data said lot individual piece technology people talk talk data lake talk data warehouse talk lake house talk ml tool look average company want platform load data run different kind analysis people data scientist say want build model people business analyst expertise write model want query data people want run calculation different kind programming language first thing built one data cloud supporting different ﬂavors second thing said really want data got across cloud nobody want say data happens cloud therefore run analysis bridge cloud vast vast majority customer using multiple cloud third thing see introduced capability organization share data people super interesting retailer consumer packaged good company example sharing demand forecast fulfillment supply chain really transforming eﬃciently supply chain run collaborate across boundary organization shifted data topic organization focus head merchandising head supply chain head logistics trained people sell okay talked little bit presentation mandiant acquisition wanted turn security minute talk focus within organization security think differentiates google cloud maybe give u example risk threat think organization facing bring back explanation mandiant write acquisition guy thomas kurian q eric sheridan thomas kurian look security portfolio two simple lens first running workload company cloud ensure safe simplifying security people today people run system breach happening invested tool fact many tool understand administer environment securely done really provide people three capability one simplifying architecturally run workload cloud second providing ability measure running assured configuration call short workload take responsibility jointly assure security third proof manage measure security posture able ensure also offer cyber insurance insurance company customer customer say running google secure proof reinsure one piece second piece variety ﬂavor cyber threat continues accelerate important factor cyber attacker long first time detected till last company affected locking window long time today keep finding new way come rationale behind mandiant super simple get world best incident response team forefront almost every attack detect new ﬂavors vulnerability coming new ﬂavor attack coming give u best threat intelligence feed world earliest response capability fed platform combining obviously google strength machine learning ai detect needle haystack compromised integrate workﬂow allows remediate importantly ask average thistle guarantee actually ejected attacker know longer compromised almost nobody tell last piece validating fact secure believe fundamentally take cybersecurity lot little product secure platform people use guarantee security posture got want come back workspace think resonates resonates everyone personal professional life touch element google workspace application suite hearing client future hybrid work role workspace may play workﬂows positioning google cloud hearing customer q eric sheridan thomas kurianwhen hybrid work happened lot organization medium company moving recording studio people issuing device mobile workforce example pilot airline nursing staff hotel company sudden guest needed access different permission biggest thing saw enormously interesting hybrid work mean work anywhere hybrid work mean want access anywhere mean need work securely anywhere need tool platform super easy use platform everybody world comfortable using platform super easy provision platform super easy administer cost particularly see asia example large large professional workforce almost use mobile primary platform use laptop desktop much got large large client hundred thousand employee overnight needed provisioned given access system platform make trivial okay know coming time want squeeze one want take opportunity ask secular growth obviously talked lot enterprise smb customer maybe leave u perspective people shifting workload public cloud bring back see google cloud specifically positioned landscape technology shift always driven business priority business priority digitization every company talked say learned pandemic taking forward drive digital customer interface bank people going come branch reach customer online offer capability trend basically driven small medium enterprise fall two different ﬂavors technology company want shrink wrap product offer digital company startup called basically technology company want u give technology power google service want use offer cloud large enterprise obviously ecosystem play need organization typically system integrator sometimes outsourced managed service provider work bringing ecosystem along helped u also get large enterprise base focused last three year obviously pleased result shown demonstrated remain confident future real player cloud computing q eric sheridan great well first thomas thank making available really enjoyed conversation second please join thanking thomas kurian google cloud part conference year
