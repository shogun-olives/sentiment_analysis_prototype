unidentified participant colette m. kress unidentified participant colette m. kress unidentified participantcolette might seem like odd question given skepticism heard investor adoption ray tracing especially first half year correct wrong rtx product already desktop sort gpu business cycle much leg rtx side yeah correct overall overall board sell desktop overall ray tracing really pleased market adoption course absolutely room grow card fit every single type price point well every single type overall gamer overall buy card 100 well way 1,000 participate overall ray tracing way see future ray tracing underpinnings gaming pc gaming think initial stage amount ray tracing see future pc gaming console others continue fuel overall gaming market well good seasonality always tricky word especially got business strong secular driver like gaming sort guide january quarter gaming least qualitatively seasonality go back look last five year four five year actually gaming sequentially january quarter year would argue going fairly severe inventory correction around crypto think seasonality business become seasonal notebook console becomes bigger part revenue yeah exactly think overall gaming business several different part desktop notebook overall console overall console picture articulated generally stronger quarter build ahead overall holiday take place q2 q3 case overall notebook see term particularly q2 q3 gear overall holiday season given great growth rate seeing overall notebook larger seasonal expectation inﬂuenced overall notebook notebook approaching close overall gaming business look q3 q4 yes type seasonality seen history desktop expect desktop grow sequentially q3 q4 colette m. kress unidentified participant colette m. kress unidentified participant colette m. kressthat helpful idiosyncratic issue one term supply issue help u understand may may affecting business two trade see impact gaming dynamic yeah case overall cpu shortage probably going year talk cpu shortage piece going remind term desktop notebook tend type system find oems generally target well seen real impact last quarter overall cpu shortage going q4 taken account know incorporated guidance well dynamic kind near term exiting october quarter started shipping new product within segment name gtx 1660 gtx 1665 ph also got shield tv shield tv pro inﬂuence kind view seasonality going january quarter yeah new product term gtx 1600 super definitely incorporated outlook look term built available market holiday season holiday season extension remember holiday season probably start time november extends term first couple month next year move pac area well shield product excited gotten tremendous review probably best streaming product buy holiday season excited market see show term end quarter year saw investor interest cloud gaming probably mostly around google stadium announcement actually involved talk little bit sort view cloud gaming something ready go complementary business accretive business dilutive kind strategy seem pairing service provider got think project taiwan russia japan softbank korea strategy attack market unidentified participant colette m. kressyeah gaming market certainly new u look overall streaming opportunity absolutely something future wanted make sure right based many year working together overall ecosystem whether game engine whether overall game developer building overall software ability underlying infrastructure whether going desktop whether going notebook going back term data center people want stream approach bring game play infrastructure enabled using overall streaming service put together allows u keep great collaboration partnership overall ecosystem open different type game many others approaching overall streaming market maybe couple game ready go market hundred continue game approach actually approaching market looking streaming opportunity address market addressed yet willing full desktop created willing go buy overall notebook probably maybe also want social aspect gaming matter ability overall stream geforce overall streaming service allows u working overall telco many area broadband next key place killer app overall gaming overall host excited relationship term creating new telco opportunity also keeping great connection existing gaming ecosystem year ago lot sort noise around crypto think even inside looking diﬃcult kind quantify full impact crypto happening seen tremendous growth gaming bottom still 150 million kind peak quarter last year think growth rate gaming think mix unit asp really really strong powerfully asp story company last five six seven year yeah overall gaming industry strong entertainment market advanced tremendously last five social tool allows people stay connected enjoy game want see innovative introduction ray tracing continue able overall grow market asp important remember also keep portfolio card type gamer industry want high end want able bring anyone interested gaming market seen gamers starting teen staying well past age 40 mean unidentified participant colette m. kress unidentified participantdifferent type discretionary income across portfolio may choose get best best choosing nvidia continued hold end part market important one helping u design believe future gaming well switching gear data center business sitting 25 revenue pointed strong october quarter expectation grew 11 sequentially wonder could talk little bit think sort digestion capacity end last year starting see uptick address question think important discus maybe impact conversational ai natural language processing business currently going forward absolutely data center business yet another tool bring accelerated computing workload overall data center well edge seen tremendous wave overall acceleration well ai last five year approaching new wave focused conversational ai conversational ai new way new technique actually deal natural language processing much overall search query speech looking way understand well word connected together mean interpret try interpret term looking type period new wave conversational ai natural language processing expansion market tremendously overall size data set size neural net much complex much bigger fueling new wave training well inﬂuencing term pleased see v100 well t4 take place expanding farther overall hyperscales see overall consumer internet company see startup ai using type technique natural language processing rendering engine also important tell u potentially read potentially shop shop also new technique ai focused right seen surge interest area think early stage take place future well q3 result although growth returned growth term overall hyperscales gave guidance q4 term data center well also believe strong growth probably accelerated growth faster q3 important point asked question call answer quite clear much specific colette m. kress unidentified participant colette m. kress unidentified participant colette m. kressguided october quarter positive data center somewhat subdued positive came better think qualitative guidance actually saying 11 sequential growth saw q3 sorry october quarter could actually accelerate january quarter correct expecting accelerated growth q3 q4 data center business also brought really another really interesting point think everybody understands dominant position training always question mark whether gpu good device use inference pointed think t4 volume october quarter actually higher v100 even though v100 record level view participation inference changing help u put number around sure t4 one key product inﬂuences overall inferencing workload yes v100 t4 hit record level q3 t4 volume higher v100 tremendous fit u see inferencing clearly percent overall data center revenue given different overall asp price point solidly landed right area people said would need overall gpu inferencing conversational ai one overall workload case complex one requires multiple stage well response time hundred millisecond term response overall programmability t4 necessary also performance even seen u participant mlperf 0.5 allowed u enter overall benchmarking overall inferencing participant actually chose enter every single overall category every single category many overall competitor even file overall compete overall competition t4 able overall inferencing used inferencing think early stage big market going forward expect next analyst day market opportunity set inference go unidentified participant colette m. kress unidentified participantwe going continue work overall tam projection save great discussion analyst day also busy sort last month new product introduction area reference mobile world la came think two kind interesting product first gpu acceleration 5g wireless ran second sort nvidia egx product intelligent edge talk little bit market opportunity egx product way try get dominant position inference marketplace position term edge computing yet another important market u consider talked overall cloud instance available hyperscalers use many overall startup performance computing market additionally think individually industry may leverage overall cloud leverage overall hybrid experience important new area overall edge computing anything see term edge device drone robot must autonomous well one favorite type edge type computing av car additionally amount partake outside overall data center overall edge server either consolidate many device together draw overall inference big market probably good size overall inferencing market well announced partnership microsoft term edge server correct also announced overall 5g ran focused term edge data center consolidating back place 5g versus older traditional method believe important area think acceleration gpu different area overall server overall infrastructure whole switching application data center kind customer guy always done well hyperscale cloud need enterprise growing new market call vertical market necessarily traditional market nvidia involved kind curious really trying exploit opportunity enterprise much channel work need done much opex imply think different vertical within segment enterprise fairly discrete manufacturing versus retail versus finance leveragable kind r opex use go colette m. kress unidentified participant colette m. kress unidentified participant yeah good question help understand vertical industry play market last year seen focus digestion data center busy work focused many vertical industry overall channel still whether hyperscalers whether enterpriser whether buy directly u buy overall oem odm server overall offering market still focus vertical focus term application vertical use accelerating application working term cuda overall platform top cuda enables specific industry application accelerated one one see large market large use seen u focus term area retail extend manufacturing supply chain folk interested data analytics better run supply chain better overall inventory management overall demand supply overall planning walmart key overall customer look customer u postal service well better sort overall amount focus term financial industry focus term computing seen u term design creative apps well focus focus performance chip table stake need performance programmability ability stitch together application use allow u reach market look traditional server market still mostly enterprise market hyperscale space growing faster still smaller portion think ai time help u kind quantify enterprise opportunity versus hyperscale opportunity believe overall industry overall inference overall likely larger opportunity total long term reach point much larger say seen wave overall ai second third wave focusing natural language processing section probably wave future absolutely emphasizing kind software ip bring table maybe emphasizing little bit silicon ip semiconductor analyst supercomputer 2019 recently think expectations/ hope colette m. kress unidentified participant colette m. kressmaybe get better understanding silicon roadmap expect guess importantly important process technology overall solution bring customer always busy work building overall architecture whether architecture whole tends serve many different market whether gaming proviz overall data center fear working technology innovation process technology exceptional last year stay tuned always something future like surprise everybody overall roadmaps thing come focus term important overall processing overall development software see lot people focused powerpoint trying compete overall performance see overall processor processor top notch matter industry still continuous improvement current node term future every single one architecture continue development cycle choose existing node also look term future node play would better u go market way operate term bring architecture market important piece node change node change improving overall processing power overall development software top allowed u ecosystem broad reach industry hyperscales speed see ai advancing acceleration advancing need ability change overall development along way need ability program otherwise investment hard get return return investment see buying overall gpus full platform extremely helpful question audience one back couple big picture question term feel like automated driving much news used wanted see feel area losing momentum feel secondly another area used popular least ordinary people kind way cyber currency wondered see trend future unidentified participant colette m. kresssure let focus autonomous vehicle area still important part industry see forward lot branched term focus want concentrate overall passenger car next couple year term level 2+ level 3 incorporating overall hardware allows continue advance software find focus term level 4 level 5 harder overall piece work changed two different area one focused key metropolis term square mile focus term captured area focus number two focused transportation truck delivery term work still important piece work probably pushed couple year overall passenger type car get speed still important automotive transportation industry term right say see great far concentrate core strategic
