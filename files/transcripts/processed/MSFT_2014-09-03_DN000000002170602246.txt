walter pritchard software analyst citi scott guthrie microsoft telling saw wearing red shirt think scott know microsoft longer alive probably worn red shirt presume every day every time see public got red shirt scott used front man least got know front man company around developer developer big part microsoft gotten today term loyalty million .net developer scott kind roll think satya nadella moving ceo role sort fill behind satya run enterprise cloud business big part revenue microsoft server product well azure scott going spend 10 minute giving u background business focused jump back q done session great thanks bunch well good afternoon thank joining u today looking forward opportunity spend time mentioned name scott guthrie run cloud enterprise group microsoft microsoft one thing satya talked quite bit last six month fact live world across microsoft working hard deliver set solution really enable customer fully take advantage new world within cloud enterprise group deliver number core enterprise server product enable world specifically window server system center active directory sql business associated data product visual studio developer product also microsoft azure commercial cloud computing platform hard kind charging cloud first world really last two year within cloud enterprise group seeing really nice momentum adoption last 12 month gained five point market share versus vmware private cloud business really seeing nice run rate public cloud base 57 fortune 500 running solution deployed top microsoft azure passed 1 million sql database deployed azure seeing growth steadily 10 30 trillion object toward azure storage system 300 million user inside azure active directory processing 13 billion authentication per week got 1.6 million developer registered new visual studio online service provides set saas service developer cloud service launched past november adoption driving really nice revenue number well see cloud enterprise fy14 revenue growth 13 particularly pleased diversity growth fy14 five separate business within cloud enterprise 1 billion revenue sql business particular fire last couple year passed 6 billion year mark last year grew 19 year even looking mature server product space like window server system center seeing really nice mix shift standard premium edition product able grow premium revenue space 40 commercial cloud announced part fourth quarter earnings passed 4.4 billion year annualized run rate commercial cloud basically oﬃce 365 azure azure growing 150 overall good market ph momentum term one question people often ask event like well differentiate cloud offering versus others market one thing often talked customer three like circle capability think combination make u unique really basically enterprise grade hybrid microsoft cloud cloud three combined think really provides truly unique cloud offering enables differentiated solution customer want spend rest time drilling kind giving sense ﬂavor term one combination really unique enterprise space one element cloud cloud really truly provides global reach hard work azure side last 12 month particular building azure footprint run world today 17 region around world customer go ahead deploy code kind global footprint enables customer deploy solution closer customer well employee ever put perspective actually two time number region aws opened around world today five time number region google cloud kind fairly unique scale opportunity make region truly impressive though size really kind differentiate call cloud provider sort traditional hosting environment region basically consists data center data center approximately size one football field length impressive fact region inaudible park two plane inside feature use much give kind sense size building make unique though fact region one data center 16 really huge amount capacity enough run 600,000 server region one region remember 17 open around world kind footprint really enables immense scale economics point basically continually cut price customer basically run operation cheaper pretty much everyone else planet also give customer ability instantly scale capacity pretty much anywhere around world full confidence ultimately think going basically three provider world u amazon google basically differentiate two circle capability enterprise grade providing truly differentiated enterprise offering term service level well ability hybrid take advantage hybrid computing provider actually software run cloud well customer environment well service provider environment kind enables customer basically maximize existing investment easily bridge cloud kind enable truly unique solution kind provide pretty wide range solution whether ranging backup dr database replication identity management cloud going see u build kind capability time think fact large footprint provides u natural attach cloud enables u take scale economics drive cost cheaper anyone else market enterprise grade hybrid azure cloud microsoft vendor delivers three combined really think provide truly unique offering enables u provide service enterprise business really one else market allows u compete hard one thing focus within c e notion call kind pillar solution focus kind walk little bit trend data center pillar capability provide term core infrastructure slide also talk scenario focusing combination think provides kind really compelling offering enterprise actually leverage solution even use u infrastructure cloud category allow u provide really good value well give kind sense going quickly walk two one enterprise mobility unlock insight data enterprise mobility front one thing looking enable employee basically use device love keeping company secure launched may new suite call enterprise mobility suite basically combine number different capability kind one nice bundle customer enables basically enable employee productive device want use connect solution want use well part include intune offering provides mobile device management work including io well device provides way basically enforce policy top employee fairly way take advantage trend seeing enterprise also add identity integration part suite core differentiator enables single 2,000 different saas application including one running inside cloud environment part suite actually provide called saas discovery capability enterprise cio could actually look network log actually determine saas apps approved enterprise using hundred saas apps employee taking advantage know discover basically go azure quickly wire adapt allows enforce single corporate company credential solution basically two step enable salesforce.com support workday concur google apps kick even let manage aws way provides really nice solution allows enterprise keep identity secure might heard news little bit hacking going celebrity earlier week one thing built solution kind compelling machine learning employee logging detect suspicious behavior like loss password reset attempt loss incorrect password someone supposed new york logging romania basically automatically file alert security oﬃcers automatically enforce two factor authentication top device next time log actually also answer say sm challenge addition knowing password combination kind provides much secure solution also part enabling remote desktop support running cloud basically allows organization run window client application want cloud expose different type device io android well window client user basically click sign using security mechanism immediately productive existing window application regardless device using running safely cloud optionally bridged hybrid way environment basically kind huge opportunity u fy15 price list literally week fy14 seen really really strong demand nice kind solution think really tailored world also one allows uniquely positioned sale motion perspective clearly attache lot existing motion going see u aggressively go solution every oﬃce 365 customer inaudible every time customer renews one client access license u every two three year kind obvious attach going able part motion great work regardless infrastructure cloud using kind easy attach solution well last thing walk really quickly unlock insight data pillar core part value proposition really deliver set data solution enable customer get insight well run business better mentioned earlier sql business 6 billion year run rate growing 19 q walter pritchardin addition kind core sql work also whole bunch additional data service providing increasingly going forward see u move data analytics space category really compete today think right disruption really nice adjacent business u add also see u continue add additional saas capability data space one quick demo power bi basically solution enables organization create operational dashboard enterprise nice seamlessly integrates data sql business also people data including oracle ibm sap et cetera also designed kind embrace first world saas also pull data saas provider well example sale force integration demo second fact roll video kind see quick view action video playing one sort simple example term data product coming market later year think nice adjacent business kind core business provide today example actually leverage take advantage prem world cloud world azure well infrastructure cloud provider term providing kind quick overview little bit business solution going go detail one think combined really provide set offering regardless customer looking transform data center store analyze data manage mobile workforce create internet thing enable next generation application great solution compose incredibly well think go enterprise market awful lot money made healthy business u drive going open question question answer technical diﬃculty give u sense using outlined number business case typically people get going though pretty simple thing talk u demographic 57 using scott guthrie q walter pritchard scott guthrie interesting mean think lot people think cloud think term existing perspective hey want service move cloud think certainly element organization looking way kind reduce infrastructure cost thing like would say majority use case seeing right cloud though much additive traditional department would particular would say solution thing seem migrating cloud fastest look lot customer today often department business within often outside actually making shift cloud fastest example one u would tesco uk largest retailer division called blinkbox kind netﬂix uk provide premium medium streaming service first department tesco actually aggressively embraced azure basically reinvented streaming infrastructure cloud base seeing success starting see department within tesco also kind make shift including kind traditional right would say people asked earlier today cloud cannibalizing business replacing right would say much additive think big opportunity cloud fact whole bunch scenario people either today costly u selfishly vendor cloud allows u kind basically enter market new way end much automation opposed service level take data analytics example think huge opportunity machine learning kind democratized predictive analytics nice profitable business several people hope profitable business u real good example transition give u opportunity conversation today expect time next two three year continues additive business think see migration part business say timeframe think u certainly near term think going continue additive business one thing focused business strategy perspective also kind design business model end hopefully additive perspective example today make money window server license q walter pritchard scott guthrie q walter pritchard scott guthrie q walter pritchard right fairly small percentage overall spend window server azure world even aws world still make money window server license want world cloud opportunity certainly make money storage layer networking layer compute layer additive management service go around frankly monetize today hope even type world see server shift cloud opportunity u additive net set ph think guess maybe get business running economics perspective expect impact expect revenue profit look c e business next say two three year undergo transition seen company move cloud type business model headwind maybe absorb business sold upfront ongoing basis business seen much headwind expect term revenue profit well think term kind talked little bit finance beginning term right kind unique position whole bunch different business really fire good way business slightly different space term think transition cloud would say lot scenario even one walked take power bi enterprise mobility suite net additive existing client access license business well existing sql business case migration cloud type cloud service replace existing revenue le shift license annuity might expect lot business inside c e today infrastructure perspective beyond additive scenario also large part majority revenue based enterprise agreement kind two renewal also kind change dynamic little bit business competitor probably give u little bit smoother ramp ph well think okay got another sort economic question amazon google pretty ruthless amazon google kind entered fray term leaning price pushing pricing scott guthrie q walter pritchardlargely matched roughly matched price decrease pushed get point start become impactor profitability term business amazon profit company give take concern manage concern term relentless push price well think term think way thought business couple fold one want go enterprise provide kind total package solution enterprise need infrastructure business able offer type service price always think many case mean sophisticated important price set market made decision azure match commodity price amazon cut price usually within 48 hour cut basically think combined together need kind cut price need match think accelerated overall adoption pretty nice way gotten u position thing like storage particular probably price anyone else market offer three u kind put u nice structural position yet cost economics actually continue still term profitable business portfolio perspective think type infrastructure going key thing want balance though also higher value service take analytics take device management enterprise mobility suite take machine learning take kind much higher margin offering able kind overall package think end unique would say also versus amazon google infrastructure side also slightly unique position monetize compute storage also monetize license software running vm whenever amazon sell window vm make decent amount money likewise azure sell vm running window make also decent amount money think gross margin core compute bad might think actually make fairly decent chunk software running inside vm well change overall dynamic probably margin business way probably different taking competitor okay got actually going kind go next talk bit platform versus infrastructure sense disclosure around business become transparent last year really get sense going scott guthrie q walter pritchard scott guthrie q walter pritchard scott guthriei think little bit diﬃcult tell appears though azure business really took added infrastructure option sort came mainstream market highlighted attach ip intellectual property window sort people building apis unique offer charge versus commodity product talk sort adoption point platform level service thing ultimately higher margin today think future versus commodity piece yeah think definitely infrastructure side mean lot azure business made pretty substantial change interim perspective two year ago really first previewed infrastructure service capability later fact year ago april actually le 18 month since sla seen huge growth know analogy often use people going shopping like shopping mall going store premium service people end thinking store want get purchasing also going buy stuff ph going buy something much inaudible often motivates trip mall begin gap azure cloud strategy premium stuff infrastructure capability close gap certainly much complete offering sale motion perspective well way increasingly sell azure enterprise called enterprise agreement basically someone buy say 1 million azure capacity usage spend infrastructure well premium service often see kind motion call land expand people start infrastructure desktop quickly expand premium service think key part kind overall motion another thing watching introduced last question asked percentage coverage yeah right exactly think disclosed q4 number half azure customer also using premium service rate actually q walter pritchard scott guthrie q walter pritchardincreasing kind land expand motion mentioned definitely one seeing usage perspective well revenue perspective okay thing noticed sort thinking term supporting natively product top azure mean announcement oracle supporting new sql database think new sql database sort release technology market use example seeing change thinking microsoft last say three four year ultimately think monetizing type offering premium service ip might something either others get paid like oracle open source ip built sort technology running top azure yeah analogy use within team keep old friend make new friend think past focused keeping friend necessarily making new friend especially enterprise space every enterprise combination lot different technology whether deliberate whether acquisition oracle sql ibm shape form whoever say stuff work microsoft stuff kind closing bunch opportunity frankly harder trusted vendor work stuff think shift made last couple year think helped drive particular made big difference market example people room might know partnership last year oracle fact cloud vendor oracle certified oracle enterprise support call oracle enterprise support someone else cloud say sorry support could support cloud fairly substantial change type relationship past oracle done similar relationship sap recently announced partnership salesforce thing like analytics suite showed power bi integrate salesforce data example sure salesforce time add analytics offering ability integrate well thousand saas vendor able kind unique play think end appealing customer base get u much conversation ultimately win got part success story microsoft decade isvs software vendor developer inside company developer inside software company long history desktop vendor software vendor software vendor built software scott guthrie q walter pritchard scott guthrieon top window server azure know necessarily enterprise company lot consumer company building top ew sort stack isv territory sort historically isv traction azure yeah certainly would say think move cloud think one thing important kind keep eye people move cloud infrastructure application obviously people move cloud adopt stack custom infrastructure custom apps also saas winning heart mind saas vendor going play important part one core push azure beginning really isv almost half azure revenue come isvs actually much higher percentage think people might naturally think way ultimately think need kind compete going term getting saas run apps top azure top infrastructure well thing like example mobility suite power bi suite showed enable isvs integrate enterprise mobility suite free got 2,000 saas vendor including one running microsoft stack cloud integrated also monetize enterprise selling enterprise mobility suite also kind core part inaudible motion whole stack isv simply integrate construct interesting business model monetize well definitely think ecosystem effect going really important u go got think maybe term software came microsoft first place heard back maybe 15 year ago azure large football infrastructure business microsoft could leverage azure search xbox live oﬃce 365 talk u sort internally customer speak business leveraging azure capacity yeah term pretty much every microsoft property app run top common infrastructure football sized data center basically solution running inside part software piece azure kind multiple different thing apps process inaudible top anytime use oﬃce 365 authentication infrastructure go azure active directory store thing one drive going azure storage use new oﬃce 365 video app going medium service pack inside azure et cetera xbox live likewise run halo run titanfall game came early q walter pritchard scott guthrie q walter pritchardthis year xbox one 100 azure fact titanfall game came one premier game xbox actually spent 250,000 virtual machine inside azure launch day kind example sort extreme level capacity think cloud enables type elastic scale peak end month holiday season drop needed pay use certainly looking use inside microsoft skype likewise running azure basically plan take probably two three year everything pretty aggressively moving new stuff also existing stuff kind moving top common software stack well yes mentioned 57 fortune 500 using azure 43 using azure go sale call hear feedback field force around holding people back top three term people leveraging azure going 100 today interested factor well think mean think infrastructure solution released 12 18 month ago bunch solution people would say well sound cool know yet look adoption last quarter two also seeing hockey stick growth think see even use case come pretty quickly still people differentiate department lot adoption cloud even 57 still coming business unit department particular product side customer facing side organization think case starting come party great opportunity u think seeing lot people moved last year cloud general hey going big thing hey use case win fully expect continue grow got note think talk generally around topic woke morning checked inaudible reader saw sort landmark case right around data sovereignty guess microsoft data center ireland something u.s. government saying want email data center ireland sort brought ﬂoor recent issue heard around nsa sort outreach u.s. government set industry back know sort concern highlighted tech exec could actually occur american company seen regard scott guthrie q walter pritchard scott guthrie seen revenue slowdown mean think nsa stuff first came wondered going cause people pause generally think people worried still paused people worried ended worried end think something industry perspective overall legal perspective something think u need worry industry across world across u.s. think brad smith kind spoken quite bit publicly term position think going continue evolve think ask government clarify position well make sure good principle place think going ongoing dialog continue got last question let crowd run got breakout session starting session pat gelsinger hot seat talking vmware put stat seen many time market share gain certainly virtualization space could highlight u think gaining share either type customer type workload within installed base well think historic play cloud enterprise worked well u basically provide great solution customer charge huge premium certainly look data business today lot hockey stick sql growth coming tier 1 workload enterprise edition premium product pricing still third cost oracle tier 1 solution solution enterprise credibility tier 1 significantly competitor see hockey stick revenue growth come cheaper tier 1 quality get reputation place right data space paying huge dividend think also reached space virtualization category well people say gosh cheaper vmware boy offering pretty darn good leader quadrant gartner stuff ca integrated part window data center would buy one server data center get without pay extra think lot growth happened thing think watch u window server 2003 going end life next summer share window server 2003 exactly 0 window server 2003 window q walter pritchard scott guthrieserver 2003 instance get updated think also going opportunity u gain significant virtualization share pure vmware environment grab pay little bit get window server data center get virtualization included part think going give u nice growth momentum next 12 18 month well great well scott thanks lot coming get red shirt issue great thanks thanks much
