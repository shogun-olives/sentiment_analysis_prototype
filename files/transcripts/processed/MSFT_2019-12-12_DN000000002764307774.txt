alright let start know people still kind ﬂocking changing over ph tight conference chris good see good ph see different role maybe let start actually current role would define sure sure thank raimo good see good back saddle telling mike earlier today current role two year two year currently head finance cfo cloud ai division think familiar largely synonymous external reporting segment call intelligent cloud encompasses certainly azure get lot attention also portfolio includes window server sql server well business application actually get reported different segment also responsibility area alluded five year previous head ir job good back chris suh raimo lenschow chris suhyes okay perfect know also like azure big one big growth opportunity microsoft everyone kind excited problem everyone kind frame like ultimate opportunity kind side way come like better way like way actually kind help u one sure unique business unique maybe unique unique time industry think feel super fortunate able participate every company planet sort thinking digital state think transforming moving work ﬂows cloud sort really generation sort time like find think microsoft uniquely benefiting couple way obviously secular trend talked sort big population customer thinking move cloud cost saving also access service sort modernize environment think accessing security management feature way maybe accessible previously structural tailwind growing market uniquely continue continue deliver great value proposition sort cloud solution story providing sort digit asset partnership many many year structurally helping u tam large sometimes try put dollar would say gated anything market standpoint opportunity execute capture german trying trying baseball like like think like seems like think inaudible last week invent talked like 4 workload actually cloud versus kind 96 still like see kind point journey would disagree sentiment vast majority workload remain yet cloud early day transition said feel like great position rich longstanding trusted relationship vast majority company still running predominantly think trusted strategic partner think good shot partner think best position much spur long game result think feel great market position raimo lenschow chris suh raimo lenschow chris suh yeah talk little bit evolution azure last year know like someone aws guy little bit headstart whereas look customer conversation last year thing really changing customer relationship coming inside like evolved evolving yeah interesting market evolved said think feel good position momentum business significant scale still growing high rate 63 know last quarter sense like value proposition differentiation changed much start viewed strategic partner said customer mean ability offer sort broad stack cloud solution whether azure infrastructure side application oﬃce dynamic way m365 offering ability help customer solve solution comprehensive way secondly cadence innovation mean continue launch new product continue expand portfolio solve problem talked thirdly maybe importantly commitment hybrid approach consistent since day one think seen lot competitor sort embrace hybrid think validation view world one playing way hybrid u always meant like hybrid core mean informed way built architected product informed way brought service market really consistency experience cloud edge sort embracing committed hybrid day one think real differentiator think really true hybrid provider provide consistency set solution cloud edge think continues resonate customer sort continue long strategic conversation enterprise customer tends number one differentiator talk little bit well azure side inaudible azure side like call kind sometimes call premium service talk little bit mix see think mobile product part like azure evolving like different product offering raimo lenschow chris suh raimo lenschowit good question get one frequency azure product family going continue evolve sense like think analogous oﬃce way right oﬃce historically synonymous excel powerpoint word time oﬃce365 offer expansive thing like collaboration communication well productivity sense like analogy say azure continue evolve today think commonly thought sort core service within azure infrastructure iaa taas offering fastest growing part number see talk azure growth externally faster growing portion larger dollar contributor continues consumptive based see growth within customer like like continue move workload continue build application consume service continues grow sort le limited let say number employee number seat number user consumptive part business part really excited obviously another category revenue within azure business call either saas call per user time commonly thought em mobility enterprise mobility suite power bi part per user construct sort gated different dynamic consumptive part business still seeing good great momentum saw seat growth last quarter 30 35 plus think 36 last quarter big base usage growth like business many per user model outside oﬃce within oﬃce outside azure within oﬃce business window business see growth continue moderate seat growth different consumptive really whole thing important u sort benefit comprehensive cloud provider yeah mean look like iaa paas think long run probably bigger partner user like finite number like time like give like positive mix effect larger today growing faster weighted heavily toward consumptive part business continues grow faster per user base mix continue mix point fast forward x number year three five year whatever number good part even bigger portion start replicate talk also like little bit premium service like would assume like advantage corporates ph already much heritage software company chris suh raimo lenschoweveryone else like either trying steal open source vendor trying make money try develop journey premium service guy yeah journey right interesting sort space talked like customer really trying solve one problem trying solve like hey move compute environment sort thing trying solve think relationship like customer commits azure five seven year dollar thinking holistically service whether internally call core premium sort indifferent customer thing trying solve seeing core infrastructure side business mature business larger business naturally therefore reﬂecting growth rate mature seeing fast growth sort data service premium service talk say starting still much smaller mixing way growth rate seeing mean really think customer journey talked like sort multi sort billion dollar type commitment mean journey move everything move sort slowly sense move workload work migrate something evaluate optimize see curve go like sort optimizes figure like going use going use grow see curve go like straight line right context early day migration sort first play customer think window sql environment running outside cloud migrating azure got great hybrid offer let preserve value migrate move environment sort next step innovation app modernization legacy modernization literally building new native cloud application like seems next phase course innovating higher scale thing like sap workload kubernetes thing seeing like sort phase customer journey sort part customer engagement mean touched migration next question actually funny like becoming like maybe inaudible always trusted partner many client seems coming tracking like incremental dollar gaining number actually increasing look bigger field saw like one competitor last week kind trying point like oh please need adopt like better scale like relationship kind working chris suh raimo lenschow chris suhknow trust inaudible client see coming term contract looking like size contract getting structured etcetera seen lot positive momentum think heard amy hood cfo talk earnings call talked number let say 10 million plus deal signed customer great sign trust u intent partner use 10 million sort arbitrary line deal think familiar exceeded nine figure buying solution buying partner buying partnership strategic partnership fantastic seeing like said seeing great momentum think feel great early thing mean like signed billion dollar commitment customer real work still left front partner customer figure roadmap transformation work architecture standpoint technical standpoint either migrate something spin new project get call internally talked getting meter spinning measure consumption get meter spinning lot real work done customer fantastic committed u work journey yeah okay perfect let shift gear little bit bought github kind fitted right kind microsoft dna always steep ph almost developer think get kind deeper question like around azure development seen impact github part organization feed azure help u little like way frame raimo developer really important rich part history success date partnership rich developer ecosystem exactly right really important priority u success github successful developer ecosystem writing azure initially think github brings way get github operates independently think know well like part sort new model satya amy sort implemented company like linkedin github operate independently yet still obviously connection nat run github report scott guthrie linkedin business report directly satya raimo lenschow chris suh raimo lenschow chris suhso strategic alignment yet operate independently think really nice symbiotic balance two get github core continues developer developer ecosystem really healthy continued see think satya talked last earnings continue see momentum growth number developer grown approximately 30 time one year part microsoft family momentum standalone really fantastic think like sense last year think biggest benefit microsoft cultural anything meaning like notion microsoft open platform notion great partner even company compete compete customer go market together think way graceful make sense u think notion opened microsoft opened whole population developer previously really thinking writing azure predominantly think super positive move forward sentiment sort health ecosystem important need careful time inaudible one thing started move ahead competition like term international buildout mean data center know still true data center inaudible group combined internationally talk little bit strategy footprint mean term like adoption yeah data center region think actually know many data like ... yeah sorry yeah term application consistent strategy beginning broad globally thinking data center footprint always belief long run putting data center place customer want consume data provision service strategic advantage built datacenter footprint broadly 54 region around world region competitor raimo lenschow chris suhwe think strategic advantage think important right also though mean add complexity think ability provision service though even though complex take interesting challenge course always take good signal take month lead time build data center good signal geography get precise signal going term capacity need six month 12 month 24 month sort disperse geographic way make execution challenge think done pretty good job like cfo need kind ask couple financial question well get question around gross margin lot talk substantial increase improvement last couple quarter think factor investor look think gross margin profile long run sure think first foremost try fairly transparent progress commercial cloud gross margin important company important measure gross margin seen continue march consistently time reﬂects progress made across business said know oﬃce business oﬃce 365 business mature growth phase mature phase lifecycle therefore margin closer north star see commercial cloud number continuing improve really largely driven right improvement seeing azure lifecycle 61 think last quarter commercial platinum mean pretty healthy number across whole stack said still think continued room improvement really predicated thing talked sort ability continue expand data center footprint globally much ahead demand good signal geography sort optimize enough capacity month road also capacity get expensive ineﬃcient also ability continue make improvement eﬃciency stack hardware software bunch decision tactical nature build versus leased sort eﬃciency power management etcetera etcetera go drive real margin improvement would say given moving part still confident ability say structurally margin structure like believe different world exists u hyperscalers term ability reach industry leading margin path may look little different u others yes raimo lenschow chris suh raimo lenschow chris suh raimo lenschow subject like talk kind tech hardware vendor god bless kind last quarter started complain like oh hyperscalers pulling back little bit like negative kind demand signal look capex number change actually continue kind keep investing healthy pace kind factor kind understanding better like build data center going white label stuff like two comment correlated great question ca really speak sort pretty much could tell see side like continue invest stuff talked term expansion continue invest ahead demand signal sort waning demand let say plenty demand always going try optimize always going try optimize way eﬃciency spend mean sort could mean investing sort capability build data center different way eﬃciency standpoint ca reconcile comment could say capex continues big investment u see plenty demand horizon let u continue make investment perfect see 22nd place wow good timing thank much thank everyone joining
