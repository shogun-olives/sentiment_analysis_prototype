like gdp growth whatnot q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbaueryes know heard 15 year one thing think people look company highest level 2 substantive growth driver course lot important business 2 biggies really around azure microsoft 365 many way evolution oﬃce 365 talking developer core mission value proposition company think productivity collaboration also core sort spirit soul microsoft really business long time evolved many many way oﬃce kind center value proposition perspective could strategic could important think interesting time market right seeing business environment sort new culture work emerging last couple year driven whole number shift term demographic shift like millennial population coming market something like 2020 50 population millennials got big shift market term physically work get done 50 yes exactly gen x lost generation actually changing really way people work together notion teamwork collaboration super different sort growing early workplace notion sort individual hero important success team collaboration think meta point first time go talk cio information technology leader business interested serving need end user people business getting engaged giving tool want modern tool sort experience personal life workplace 10 year ago security compliance locking thing structured work amazing pressure next generation worker putting bdms business leader great tooling workplace creating huge opportunity u oﬃce feel like got sort incredible balance able solve service need end user trying create thing trying team collaborate together analyzing data working project whatever might also platform secure compliant got control folk need interesting part think cloud transition sort looping back started question framed question many workload workload moved cloud first large part oﬃce 365 think successful able leverage broad installed base sort legacy world bring base cloud workload hot business right suggesting oﬃce done incredibly well q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauerlast couple year oﬃce 365 forefront next big step microsoft 365 evolution look old oﬃce versus new oﬃce 365 oﬃce run cloud lot help u understand somebody deployed oﬃce 365 value getting could get oﬃce 2013 oﬃce 2010 oﬃce 2007 think oﬃce 2010 still 365 hope get one day life going look like upgrade oﬃce 365 yes sure well first broadest level oﬃce 365 much diverse value proposition many people think think word excel powerpoint secure mail backend exchange sort document sharing collaboration service sharepoint onedrive communication skype business new product essentially supersede talk called microsoft team also variety new emerging workload part whether product called microsoft stream power bi also part oﬃce 365 analytics content really broad set service help people creative help people analytics help people teamwork collaboration essentially broad value proposition addition though build security compliance product big driver way growth moving cloud forth certainly talk one key part value proposition relative sort old legacy world one element cloud delivered mean different thing mean customer date latest capability value important world moving quickly technology changing end user want stuff opposed saying guy 2010 whatever mean literally software built 2007 started working oﬃce 2010 ... like test thing sometimes buggy yes exactly like literally delivering software weekly basis mobile device corporate customer give option whether want consume software monthly basis longer chunk essentially notion always date important user value also listening cisco conversation moment ago ability able deliver secure platform particularly world vast array different threat secure environment cloud day mean number security professional q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauerthousands people working security scale able deploy customer powerful value proposition yes intrigued said functionality included collaboration chat team said microsoft team microsoft team yes yes hearing lot context github acquisition implication atlassian atlassian et cetera discussion investor make whole space onedrive part whole content management collaboration folk like slack unified communication folk like ringcentral et cetera tremendous initiative get videoconferencing audio conferencing market big chunk sku see disparate functionality playing followed collaboration market 20 year really failed materialize really pretty significant way change maybe oﬃce 365 overarching umbrella chance thing come together yes space around many life think one quite interesting really fueling around notion collaboration obviously quite hot talk little bit essentially value proposition company look need right tool right task many cio go talk say gosh want one thing ca one thing solve collaboration need reality would nice really realistic nature project work different could working project together maybe document working could team 50 100 people working project project last couple day last 6 week last year project different center gravity document output innovation creating new product broad space people like work differently turn approach deliver oﬃce 365 notion universal toolkit mean variety different tool right type collaboration project culture team term want adopt particular project example referenced sharepoint onedrive people want work document oﬃce sharepoint onedrive oﬃce application making work incredibly well together thing like time collaboration sort seamless workﬂow make easy share document together able track change see happening important collaboration experience q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauerthere important part mentioned unified communication really key see tremendous amount growth skype business online service today whether using instant messaging workload meeting collaboration voice talk total addressable market tam space voice service large one particularly think service like pstn service forth investing deeply area long time really coming together quite nicely notion sort experience built product called microsoft team think team essentially hub teamwork many way value proposition talking bringing together one unified approach team absolutely messaging capability threaded persistent chat like lot different service done sort magic product fact integrating oﬃce service directly pop open team environment see see word excel powerpoint integrated beautifully like microsoft onenote integrated power bi integrated well adding unified communication service thing like ... videoconferencing videoconferencing part make phone call team set structured meeting schedule meeting well ad hoc meeting canvas scaffolding team one reason ... integrates calendar integrates calendar team calendar associated ... got ai lot opportunity ai across oﬃce 365 communication one talk value proposition intelligent communication example one scenario talked enterprise connect conference couple month ago guess setting three phone call human actually tricky like button press phone literally team speak team ui whether phone shell say hey let set call q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauerbetween kash kirk victoria jonathan ai agent behind simple example something save people whole bunch time idea box integrated experience ton work done smartphone need desk phone right yes team experience also mobile experience well yes telling lot people presentation set voicemail desk phone eight year back instruction came manual said way still know whole world communication moved cell phone running capability definitely big transition go business see fewer fewer desk phone come bank america see desk phone still got get oﬃce 2010 sound like know one salient aspect oﬃce business revenue growth outstripping unit growth presumably lot upsell going help u understand whole e3 cycle e3 e5 upgrade cycle thing looking enterprise deployed e5 business benefit life look like particularly maybe microsoft already deployed e5 internally oh yes sure well gosh lot question let sort unpack little bit broadest level obviously big business referenced complex bunch different workload business model relatively simple basically p x q business model want get many socket possibly u ... q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer glad said thought missing something p x q totally resonates super simple econ 101 want drive many subscriber possibly see tremendous amount opportunity continue overall installed base expansion broadly speaking oﬃce set workload still see growth sort mid high single digit fantastic business many socket already talking commercial point see opportunity place like smb tremendously underpenetrated term opportunity look like ahead see opportunity category worker called worker oﬃce traditionally gone knowledge worker information worker market people room essentially people work pc particular focus higher need whole class worker feel like cloud economics allow u target example whether hospitality worker retail professional whether ﬂight attendant health care professional necessarily sit front pc day absolutely need scheduling collaboration task management forth see big socket opportunity u well also say emerging market u interesting opportunity particularly think market traditionally targeted part business think emerging market tremendous potential well second part course getting socket driving much arpu possibly balancing share need obviously want go far arpu impact share spend lot time thinking model question arpu side continue see arpu growth fantastic see big part transition prem cloud view part p equation sense higher ltv customer able deliver service course margin top service delivering well fantastic still customer sort purchased online service moving higher tier roughly 40 base still e3 still tremendous opportunity move sort e1 workload say sharepoint exchange move e3 big part arpu mix fact frankly biggest part right mix tremendous opportunity referenced thing called e5 e5 highest tier service folk sort steeped e5 value proposition around well voice service talked around communication analytics service thing like power bi sort ... q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer team microsoft team microsoft team service today service actually e1 e3 depending look like service though calling e5 tier sure security compliance big driver e5 value proposition whether sort threat intelligence service also compliance gdpr really big push would say world sort slow realizing something going affect european company particularly last 6 nine month seen big market like u.s. wake gdpr see e5 three year journey e5 big factor arpu shift well see tremendous amount opportunity going forward resistance customer upgrade e5 usually hear oh pricey need functionality ready maybe resistance issue educating customer base well could say resistance think somewhat bit old dog journey p x q business introduce next tier service whether geez oﬃce client going standard enterprise oﬃce 365 introducing e3 e4 e5 shift microsoft 365 shift e3 e5 component well always inﬂection point really begin see hockey stick part growth think still sort moving curve e5 side sure value proposition around would say depends customer serve many different customer security compliance sure top workload really driving e5 value proposition right fact diﬃcult go visit customer talk security talk compliance lot fragmentation market build security compliance capability right product bit unique value proposition talked little bit ai earlier key piece well something customer looking deploy right away right sale cycle faster say sale cycle something like voice ripping pbx putting new software longest sale cycle wrong yes well come like company building new building really natural time contract come contract q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbaueryear contract come great time go sale dynamic little bit different across workload studied math offer relatively sizable discount e5 buying component alone absolutely economic value proposition even customer interested deploying right particular workload even couple workload tipping point say like okay shoot maybe ready voice want analytics capability want compliance capability security stuff let go e5 seeing lot got got yammer several year back made way team team complete rewrite exists yammer yes know yammer great acquisition u part universal toolkit referenced term right tool right task think something like well scenario walked talked document collaboration talked team team people working together yammer another interesting part value proposition one would say gotten new life breathed last couple year ceo leader big part company want able get touch employee organization want able communication discussion essentially organization think yammer sort outer loop communication would used purpose example microsoft satya read community yammer community look think look every day employee post question responds directly delegate one directs maybe legal question brad ... bot yes exactly bot right could bot guess idea foster employee connection yammer done quite well business really interested vehicle able talk broadly organization dialogue really really different small group u working together project quite pleased done bunch work yammer last couple year work showing value infrastructure work term integrating core capability around oh gosh group technology make integrate easily whether outlook team whether thing like compliance capability security capability single rest oﬃce 365 service bunch integration work done lot great energy lot great value mobile device course key core pleased q kasthuri gopalan rangan q gowrishankar subramanian kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer different looking product value proposition lot innovation introduced product juncture anybody question raise hand get mic checking see know shankar team definitely question 2 question right okay shout paraphrase question ask shy putting spot really inaudible maybe question enterprise mobility suite talked installed base experimental user inaudible talk trending growth rate projected growth rate see next year kind put take around yes room know everybody heard question around enterprise mobility security big part microsoft 365 big part business seen tremendous growth installed base inaudible referenced publicly quoted 65 million great grew 55 growth incredibly strong em em bunch different workload almost suite product similar say oﬃce 365 tell u exactly em yes figured could got identity component folk thought active directory azure active directory key part identity core workload like oﬃce microsoft 365 applicable many business need set identity system security moved identity longer sort even matter oriented literally notion identity core essential security workload huge driver growth great also security compliance component part em example azure launched azure active directory advanced threat protection set capability one example went ga march time frame compliance capability well azure information protection word providing service help thing like data loss data leakage protection document whatever might important component managing device talk modern management em service called intune manage device variety ﬂavors including io android capability around thing like conditional access forth q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauerreally suite around identity around device management around security compliance business model one product sold separately also natural attach motion oﬃce 365 one reason decided launched microsoft 365 bake oﬃce plus window enterprise also em suite seeing u lot integration work make really sort seamless experience customer big growth driver u sure calling 365 denied vacation trying funny 28th one exactly like europe got microsoft 340 right u.s. microsoft 375 overworked curious get thought reorg done end march rationale thing look post reorg objective yes sure yes pretty substantive reorg internally know people really care outside world big deal internally sense moved ... big deal internally big deal right got see essentially think sort advancing cloud platform aspiration broadly whether platform iaa side saas side mentioned earlier azure microsoft 365 sort hero product company right obviously many product key driver u created essentially 2 center gravity core engineering company one led rajesh jha run called experience device group big part sort bringing product product ethos experience sort value q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan q unidentified participant kirk koenigsbauerproposition talking little bit morning together oﬃce component window shell window experience component component em talked also device experience surface line product whether big hub device surface new surface laptop surface book whatever might really bringing whole notion experience together device one organization one big part part course cloud ai part company think bringing together asset platform side pushing forward github acquisition sort important perspective well sort center gravity think developer infrastructure guy like san francisco yes like san francisco last 2 acquisition valuable one san francisco interesting say yes creates nice center gravity 2 big engineering orgs absolutely work closely together example talking em part em built cloud ai group part built e group lot kind experience important like going back old day division anything along line still functionally aligned company 2 center gravity really help u accelerate ambition cloud side think genesis really think mentioned oh yes question nadi get mic center table going back moment discussion oﬃce p x q think time horizon guess 2 question one think mid high single growth unit sustainable time horizon secondly force rank growth think get unit versus pricing one sort bigger driver period q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbaueryes interesting first question anticipate able continue grow installed base sort range think huge opportunity u talked driver think growth come obviously still room large commercial space public sector space lot come new category opportunity around worker smb think emerging market forth arpu side continue feel lot opportunity cloud shift shift e1 workload e3 probably big driver u continue quite bullish e5 potential year particular beginning see real strength compliance security talked little bit team talked little bit skype business voice communication space also see quite bit opportunity going forward term dividing percentage come sharing level detail think opportunity p q continue drive business business course drive socket get big number growth rate exactly 3 five year course going look little bit different arpu growth opportunity think quite substantive question one final question/observation think mentioned word window whole talk happening window tell u window mean hear lot oﬃce 365 azure anything say anything say yes sure talking little bit microsoft 365 think really fact interesting take step back hero really driving right think productivity collaboration experience microsoft 365 microsoft 365 oﬃce asked bunch oﬃce question great love take day window core part moving people window enterprise skus well em window remains important ever term delivering rich endpoint experience pc device increasingly different type device like surface hub forth quite bit work oﬃce window engineering team make sure much guess would call coherent well integrated symmetrical set experience people using window shell using experience device rajesh leadership team window leader oﬃce leader sitting together working problem forth reorganization think actually important window business oﬃce business brings team together way satya really q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauer q kasthuri gopalan rangan kirk koenigsbauerpushing year kind really hardens sense hey window business oﬃce business microsoft 365 sort push really driving marketing bundle ginned reorganized sale force reorganized engineering team leading microsoft 365 hero experience talk much growing triple digit term seat direction moving window absolutely fundamental value proposition microsoft 365 first product company started yes good note want thank sticking u three day going third day going wrapping hour special call folk made trip australia singapore japan one gentleman took direct ﬂight zurich nonstop another person made trip singapore really appreciate support conference heard feedback last year two day
