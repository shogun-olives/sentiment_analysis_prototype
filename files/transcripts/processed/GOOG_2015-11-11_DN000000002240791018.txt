history amazon started business mean one thing created needed agile infrastructure run retailer led formation amazon web service amazon web service became successful clear would say let say seven eight year ago cloud going interesting place lot vendor led investment microsoft lot data center google default anyway using lot resource business seeing new emerging business coming one required traditional let say uber example airbnb netﬂix company essentially formed cloud infrastructure lead u whole point commercial company need manage need massive infrastructure rent much cheaper price going amazon microsoft google company public cloud spending place space according idc growing pretty rapidly point said company straight away going public cloud legacy legacy company moving infrastructure think taking slow approach right portion data compute go public cloud still want manage rest internally jesse holler anurag rana jesse holler anurag rana jesse hollerso seeing right kind emergence addition public cloud also seeing emergence private could well hybrid cloud lot company ibm oracle hp rackspace vmware focusing right still make money seeing right public cloud lot pricing pressure top three vendor anurag know amazon really 500 pound driller room dominant see public cloud spending ramping think amazon capture much market share held past would tough mean sense

cloud increased quite bit 2010 really leveled timeframe anurag rana mark forman anurag rana mark forman anurag rana mark forman anurag rana mark formanand really adoption cloud smaller agency putting public website fruit pretty much done lot pressure going come lot agency going become much comfortable putting data order bigger move towards commercial cloud even though ton cost saving likely security eﬃciencies come yeah let bring mark line get opinion lot topic already talking far thanks let see mark join u hi mark hear u hey mark hi hi mark good good thanks much mark joining u jesse discussing scorecard recently received also started discussing public cloud space would please give u insight thought may starting little bit background please great start background believe way set

reference model jesse hollerin correlate put spending business case process federal government managed investment every investment code code relates back business function called service component reference model think module application would thing like payment would grant administration contract award collection intelligence information business module service component could something executes financial traction transaction creates payment file example send treasurer transfer fund underlaying technology environment concept business case wanted agency identify strategic gap set law changing changed recent time get government focus closing performance gap big data data analytics investment relate implementation law called gpra modernization act government performance result act modernization act involved original version hill cap performance measure looking gap performance relative cost could base business case investment reducing cost relative achieve given level performance closing performance gap public policy need basic strategy global war terrorism could also justify investment basis closing performance gap understand investment general leveraging reengineer close performance gap alternative hire lot people government really ca mass close magnitude performance gap well corollary course project business transformation people ask government project fail 99 time breakdown business transformation leadership changed management diﬃcult obviously government something keep mind left white house went start silicon valley couple year came back washington worked kpmg rebuilding advisory service business transformation environment left another quite make needed went work saas went work build consulting service practice tasc probably know inaudible government acquired engility different model opportunity come unisys take creation global public sector unisys looking across globe number initiative thank mark actually talking federal acquisition reform act passed congress end last year like get opinion new power cio agency recently done lot failed four main aspect looking grade people mark forman anurag ranawhat think government going think going take corrective measure cio going forward power cio shifted technology shifted regional construct clean air cone act created federal cio called administrator free government act 2002 notion cio leader applying technology business transformation agency model good till 2004 2005 point seemed got point technology occurred hit wall business transformation change leadership role cio outside government shifted chief geek oftentimes either done away replaced cto moved cfo ironically end first obama cio role vivek kundra omb put memo basically said cio role chief technology chief geek managing infrastructure new wave social technology big data analytic tool mobile computing cloud pretty clear another major disruption congress view cio business transformation leader wall exists congress fund program thing like head start food stamp border security program give money cio program manager program manager getting fight disagreement cio go bos secretary secretary department choose cio still viewed technologist program oﬃcial accountable achieving performance objective government program program oﬃcial 90 time defer person win secretary defer program oﬃcial typically happens federal government leader making executive decision inaudible apointee breadth knowledge unwilling take risk ignore program oﬃcial view cio say barrier fund budgeted fact program oﬃcial powerful regardless congress may want make say want congress unwilling example area even today shared service tell program oﬃcers control destiny take advantage shared service hey mark anurag wanted

cio worked within agency moving way happening bureau level department level fitara actually ended creating havoc roadmap architecture seeing u state local government hadoop allowed agency segment legacy data store agency look look data within five six archetype believe six first layer really data level agency looking difference people place seen rise gi spending think going continue see growth gi spending data level dollar basically record financial transaction collection payment asset everything aircraft weapon system facility bridge forth case event event could national disaster ﬂooding south carolina example record record record issue government amazingly yet futuristic also seen dramatic growth record management investment reason generally record go along financial transaction record government documentation people call inherently governmental decision tracking obviously moving mobile bring device become much complicated data record agency activity data effectively eﬃciently collected cloud available cloud give example census bureau people sent collect pricing information go give people reader digitizer go store collect pricing data come back get put census bureau system get processed three month later find government think inﬂation familiar billion price project run mit two professor server collecting price data world think many u go amazon go travel go travelocity tripadvisor place get price notion government collect data understanding many information system collect data prepare decision maker policy analysis work transactional workﬂow know get lot data better data cloud regulatory system use input yelp twitter rather somebody go website go oﬃce fill form year later government agency going evaluate agency data system antiquated really going data analytics improve jesse holler mark formanperformance government go cloud get data data layer know part cloud get analytics service tableau example one saas product made huge inroad government disaster management webeoc basically bulletin board dominates much workﬂow around disaster management state federal level number saas application integrate apis happening legacy environment modern environment using much modular application modular application coupled data mixture inside firewall outside cloud get orchestrated old day used call service bus currently may still increasingly brokering tool thing happening device agency realizing leverage html5 put modular capability device may get component app store commercially government us concur travel example get concur app may work way government may want thing see well whole application release model morphing take advantage device mark know seen recently talking came call lot fruit public cloud kind put far government spending public cloud kind leveling last couple year see changing see push ground level grassroots move data public cloud see eﬃciencies know available commercialized solution great question government guy want move data public cloud part transparency political level working level folk recognize better data get access cloud want access data cloud marry application lot thought leadership investment got go seen think level government dozen hundred mobile apps built different level government agency becoming chaotic environment investment generally tieback measurable performance gain lot work go indicator looking basically effective digital strategy architecture work driving see chart drive round business transformation mix initiative administration think ﬂow next administration initiative generally might say initiative modernization initiative reality dealing fact government target cyber security result ca anything government involves improved use information whether transaction problem solving level really way think ca anything government get improvement without modernization technology got initiative like budgeting really take advantage gpra modernization act say going ask increase funding make business case show u performance gap closure 20 gap going close half making additional budget increase relates going make business case number thing kick fitara fitara interesting improvement clean air cone act relates risk management think probably one important aspect risk management basically say want better job justify investment business case outlining risk figuring budget want greater focus course project managing risk identifying pulling stakeholder share business transformation effort kind marriage couple interesting initiative think focus four year ago obama administration said budget request want cut legacy investment operation maintenance spend use money reinvest modernization agency spent 75 80 money legacy leaf little money much modernization called dm e development modernization enhancement one two pet project needed invest cyber security 5 model said need look operational review system even though may comfortable could take advantage new technology cut spending better use new technology looking thing like collecting data using money process data could get 95 value going enter ph cloud gi example 5 going year year agency 2 3 point think last year administration see shift spend dm e spend anurag rana mark forman anurag rana mark formanthat area make business case tie performance improvement take initiative altogether looking shift somewhere around 5 year actual expenditure 2016 continuing resolution last rest 2016 going incremental shift wo see lot new major project within existing project see thing like consolidation financial system consolidation investment erps consolidation grant system grant much bigger procurement spending federal government huge issue agency big grant maker basically civilian agency area would look see change see emphasis end day congress oversight thanks mark move next slide yes could give u insight thing changing build operate buy build operate right side went period last 10 year government tried simplify operating environment concept kind inside baseball cio council used get together every year omb strategy review could focus major initiative cio going work across agency silo order make happen cio said must give u control oﬃce automation infrastructure telecommunication every department one business case cover spending idea move common production environment agency moved virtualized environment could called private cloud see agency moving hybrid cloud environment leverage even intelligence community mix gov cloud government certified version fedramp public cloud sometimes see government going public version amazon microsoft saas application lie architecture cio focused common production environment would control thing like tic trusted internet connection one way legacy operating environment even new apps would production environment well make work network kept getting shut forth cio found build common integration test environment though every program contractor program basically funding different application built different environment need move common environment never fully successful department successful others come new environment want leverage hadoop data analytics cio focused trying get common production environment also need data environment requires capex still integration dev environment ca get rid fact program oﬃcers control money still going go build environment hear heard year got consolidate data center congress stop appropriating money directly program minding control destiny development environment really going consolidate cost data center consolidate physical facility cost lie everybody developing application differently even cost apps lack skill program oﬃcers binding constraint cio trying well course governance process trying tight including fitara saying cio control budget program oﬃcers going get around going cloud buying saas data via cloud governance environment cio shifting got maintain capex four cylinder legacy environment also understand integrate cloud apps cloud data store public private cloud environment model see survey see lot cio talking role broker aggregating trying figure going enterprise service provide believe federal cio going go well discussion next phase beyond fitara cio going wait another new law happen beginning next administration cio already adopted notion broker across environment across environment fully see next year cio making transition well understanding diﬃcult problem lower level dev environment working people actually control money make sense jesse holler mark forman jesse holler mark forman multiple speaker know cio lot stuff putting work think something talked little bit earlier experience would really interesting far perspective federal government government innovation problem say least set small organization within civilian sector one called 18f ph kind management consultant help develop really agile type software program federal government frank kendall dod cio actually ﬂew silicon valley number time year setting oﬃce valley try mend relationship valley kind recruit know lacked big skill set recently

hey use smaller company lean agile get technology big defense prime people always catered federal government see going future think good initiative holding breath right yeah hard culture change right well culture market silicon valley segmented towards return investment market government segmented towards return labor nothing fitara despite think number people toeing ph member congress get u away contacting model fine say buy line code procurement oﬃcers deal much basic thing primarily enough procurement oﬃcers satisfy even comment cloud define service level requirement binding constraint number one incapacity lack capacity among contracting oﬃcers orchestrate relationship buyer sourcing model public affair u ph people go silicon valley encourage contractor sell government turn anurag rana mark formansourcing arm real sourcing strategy incorporates buying looking order magnitude return investment private equity firm bootstrapped funded people bootstrapped almost orchestrate standpoint government resource availability let assume work figure way source silicon valley problem understanding government workﬂow leveraging technology government workﬂow back future clean air cone established government basically shut ability buy requirement unable specify way could fend protest government wanted use technology study gao audit said government buying technology technology stake shift business case model concept well thought way leverage business transformation effort take advantage technology hear people government talk people first really saying going change business

management paradigm government issue ultimately looking going solve 18f perfect example thought bring bunch technology grower technology grower sit somebody build optimal technology change people came sat government person said let build user interface issue user interface workﬂows need get engineered transformed take understanding government business process monopoly exists within washington thanks mark minute left let start q already ﬂowing reminder want ask question using side powerpoint slide first question mark cyber security funding usually good area insight new trend seeing relates cyber security yeah think even going better mean reality relatively constant slightly growing even level program oﬃcer saying security priority hold fund later result federal employee contractor family risk anurag rana mark formansomebody manipulating work project another government want work become serious issue recognized program level different level risk neochem ph issue become people different understanding risk going see investment security within program may easy break overall security budget although omb track specific portion business case happens government side system authority operate least every two year go audit validate people said yeah old school well reality way understand need secure application whole new set way people resistant think lot open driving round spending security would say would look le focus cdm although think increasing focus concept around rich hybrid cloud using mtips mtips managed security protocol go along trusted internet connection think going see rapid shift taking advantage mtips great another question interested figuring impact lot emerging technology human capital supply speak skill specific competency consider critical working emerging technology well think skill set industry side ability articulate value proposition critical thing especially people audience investing silicon valley know quite sell government critical thing company understand far along government agency trying solve problem problem chronic problem legacy attempt solve failed company come tell great new thing thing cio used get frustrated understand already problem public government wash ph audit report oversight hearing dashboard industry side understand gap government agency try problem still grappling anurag rana mark forman anurag rana mark forman jesse holler anurag ranaon government side similarly government need analyst dealing example strategic planning developing business case need data scientist understand business government close gap government need people understand service level requirement slas well useful one last question mark use case big data seen public sector point yeah think see tremendous amount strategic planning reason went school graduate school focused quantitative method policy analysis based data decision based data reagan administration lot program analysis evaluation oﬃces across department bush 41 went away clinton administration went away replaced national performance review obama administration seeing resurgence strategic planning oﬃces leverage data analytics think one best use case great final word mark final word jesse think say stability budget agreement two year via appropriation process action occur middle december may get postponed till january february clear
