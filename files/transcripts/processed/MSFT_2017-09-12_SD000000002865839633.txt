unit running yes transition traditional oﬃce business oﬃce 365 one might single biggest thing going inside microsoft lot observer maybe diving exactly transition love ask broadly saas cloud adoption look result lot peer putting whether salesforce workday servicenow frankly even saas unit inside oracle sap feel like everybody including microsoft seeing stronger adoption curve last year talk client rajesh think catalyst feel like saas adoption picked acutely last year happening even occurring inside deutsche bank publicly embracing salesforce workday well think happening large say course microsoft cloud good u great customer customer take advantage global hyperscale cloud biggest payoff customer rate innovation cloud probably order magnitude faster mean oﬃce specifically seeing great adoption would say upwards 100 million active user cloud commercially across different platform 90 million io android oﬃce user seeing increasing usage core workload exchange mail onedrive sharepoint yammer skype also newer workload like team saas movement mix shift cloud oﬃce think shared data couple month ago financial analyst briefing oﬃce 50 commercial oﬃce within cloud think fy 2/3 commercial oﬃce oﬃce 365 exchange north 70 bit mix shift sure also cloud many way democratization economy scale obvious also economy skill today many segment take sophisticated capability many vendor produce

machine learning feel super early stage think mega trend impact oﬃce business might customer apply ai oﬃce instance well think ai going pervasive starting already oﬃce every single day ten billion signal come cloud user use oﬃce signal actually belong customer belong microsoft able take signal give value back end user customer work document look going meet next trending work group organization message ﬂowing system signal today take look let give couple example take look powerpoint point end user digital designer cloud working behalf telling right content actually producing content know relevant content enterprise process linking reusing help picking right design template getting style right word powerpoint like workplace diverse globally powerpoint know guy seen recent demo powerpoint translator could talking transcription translation one ten language word like professional editor cloud working behalf making sure content professional tone geopolitically appropriate excel throw something like country label tell excel `` hi recognize entity go cell next type gdp excel auto populate gdp next treat like text string anymore tell treat like entity q karl emil keirstead rajesh jha neat outlook ai know work close organizationally prioritize focus spending time correctly meeting send note karl saying `` send deck yesterday `` outlook soon suggest deck might detect natural language query suggest right thing get right signal back u billionth signal back u get relevance correct end user ai working professional see signal ﬂowing cloud oﬃce see signal ﬂowing window enterprise see signal ﬂowing directory network able triangulate signal suggest siso hey pattern look suspect maybe want turn fa set folk encryption policy set folk mean could go think ai going incredibly pervasive ai capability going existing product make better ai capability got thing called early preview right something called workplace analytics think service add oﬃce 365 workplace analytics talked ai ai workplace analytics people decision maker leader organization hr sale professional give couple example last year bought 3 company obviously top mind `` hi company acquired

apart easy go get right process connection place one customer early customer work analytics discovered correlation salesperson eﬃciency directly correlated size internal network much much time spent customer matter much size internal network reorg around core factor ai going permeate think existing experience generate new capability start fact data signal able iterate quickly loan experiment get right relevance create value back user customer cloud much inherently way model ai model machine learning model iterated personalized creative nothing annoying assistant getting wrong even get wrong 1 3 time lose trust ui done tastefully mean bullish term generating user value customer value ai existing infrastructural oﬃce think linkedin data set think fact 0.5 billion people people rolodex

moving cloud one workload increasingly hero sku know added e5 advanced security compliance capability got phone system cloud business analytics cloud early momentum e5 great workload e5 going see longer sale cycle thing like pbx cloud existing vendor contract worked advanced threat protection lockbox conferencing super easy customer switch drive arpu thing would say arpu microsoft 365 take user centricity oﬃce 365 thinking entire need modern workplace bringing management cross device em window 10 enterprise desktop going one arpu driver u rajesh jha q karl emil keirstead rajesh jhaokay rajesh transition 365 mentioned commercial side microsoft already transitioned roughly 50 commercial base fiscal long think might take get 100 ever get 100 customer yet ﬂipped oﬃce 365 frequent sort 2 3 objection keeping sale team chipping away slowly eventually get holdup yes say like said fy think 2/3 oﬃce base going cloud messaging like exchange online outlook 70 something backed hard running year ahead thought would two year ago go back know shared exactly internally think running year ahead customer transition term customer eventually move cloud given installed base diversity regulatory context customer inaudible existence think stretch say tend like 2/3 customer bit carrot move cloud get much faster rate innovation ai ml go run see signal term get way customer would say regulatory issue public sector important see microsoft cloud intentional market make sense think one microsoft cloud azure dynamic oﬃce business case together go country much public sector unlock thing make difference bank global well know got certain consideration work chipping away want serve customer best think way cloud mean going stop product opex investment make today engineering billing cloud billing 90 95 shared yes additional test burden going support customer whether cloud want make really attractive move cloud humble blocker chipping away yes good sure get let talk little bit adjacency around oﬃce oﬃce actually act accelerant one know topic mind everybody azure amazing success microsoft feel like synergy transition oﬃce 365 even mentioned internally think one broader microsoft cloud although reporting purpose quite separate obviously feel like trend word customer make leap oﬃce probably inclined use azure sure great mind describing synergy starting azure q karl emil keirstead rajesh jhayes sure mean first would say engineering perspective scott plan together term data center footprint build data center build edge networking investment customer expectation u anyway come cloud end using remember correctly 90 customer today 90 fortune 500 customer use least one cloud microsoft interesting thing 60 use least 3 cloud microsoft pause second think look use oﬃce 365 going
