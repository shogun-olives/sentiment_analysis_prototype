many anomaly respect weather cold really hit sort thanksgiving black friday modest start also tough comp trajectory though thanksgiving black friday green line see step blue green every year last three year whether 2016 2017 2018 nice year 2018 exception last year think magnitude acceleration last week doubling growth thursday friday year actually tripling growth 7.1 going 26 71 ph talking black friday ca get around math either clearly waning momentum say bad go tough comp also something happens normally right every third line entire weekend defined thursday cyber monday average five

spending quarter retail spending pretty similar picture least directionally meaning modest growth holiday nice spike holiday somewhat slowing post friday even slower think retail spend even slower total spend 1.3 growth even bigger acceleration thursday black friday 7.5 growth like total spend drop post friday drop retail frankly little bit dramatic seen lot talk lot chatter lot report empty low velocity store perhaps trend back yes want clear message every brick mean brick combination brick mortar brick mortar lot debate lot controversy brick mortar dead pace growth going perhaps even commerce strong growth rate income may ï¬‚ip around violently still always 13 15 sometimes 20 plus percent steadily strong whereas brick mortar going slower maybe le steady think holiday season would want draw drastic conclusion couple day anyway sliced solid start ph far characterize chart something rolled recently think last year first time basically volume time price equal sale right equation transaction time ticket size equal total spend ahead go wanted highlight green green bar little bit different saw last year year brick mortar modest always little le green bar always le transaction growth low single digit modest ticket size better even showing chart four yes solid 4 growth total brick mortar spend retail year like le percent increase ticket size last year opposite brick mortar remember deck brick mortar ticket around 3 ticket time 4.7 center bar ticket size couple percent much due mix discounting impossible tell talked ticket growth last year remember talked people buying smaller smaller ticket item getting comfortable time using buying everyday good toothbrush toothpaste rather addition simply bigger ticket item like iphone average dipped growth little bit faster ticket size would necessarily say trend structure imagination lot mix lot moving part think main takeaway get away ticket size per share ph really driving growth really drive growth transaction funny business price jacking price price price come go right transaction represent core consumer spending foot store little distortion pricing mix good sign fundamental strength next slide similar look
