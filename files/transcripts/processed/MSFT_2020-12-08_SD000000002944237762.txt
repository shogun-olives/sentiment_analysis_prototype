dear heart sale effort microsoft think everybody sort know took organization sale reorg 1.5 year ago feel like investor totally forgot execution brilliant assume whatever judson althofftinkering really discernible impact result phenomenal guess may behind scene might nice opportunity describe reorg exactly judgment turned sure thanks ﬂattering way set mean perspective believe journey working pretty hard transformation still long way go company want yes several year gone pretty major market restructuring changing model 50,000 people work every day interesting thing much would note could exactly call wall street say `` hey could kind look way couple quarter trust u everything going fine deliver current plan whilst effectively changing engine plane ﬂying time five pillar approach cover brieﬂy know number question get short period time first pillar industry pillar get organizing industry period time evolution compute industry customer trying transform digitally sort obvious direction become far want help someone transformation know business well digital transformation followed technology technology servant transformation u getting deep across top industry obvious one financial service health care manufacturing retail also public sector well super critical u realign focus industry also tech pillar might seem obvious microsoft sort really atrophied lot innovation satya quick early ceo tenure point industry respect tradition rather respect innovation karl effectively go back school retrain lot folk unfortunately let go lot sale overlay role exchange hiring developer sale organization group could effectively roll sleeve write code right alongside customer bit tech renaissance solution area compete commercial sector five main area modern work technology use every day business application portfolio core apps infrastructure think lift shift modernized cloud data artificial intelligence course security underpins five core area karl keirstead judson althofffor u area retrain lot folk hire lot new folk like said kind go back school third pillar invest customer success organization think nonbillable consulting people live customer beyond deal consumption economy cloud really role super critical sell design concept help customer really adopt cloud service evolve customer success organization pretty critical evolution last several year last two pillar fourth one seems like mean end honestly wickedly grateful investment made pandemic served u incredibly well roll call digital sale force see first three thing mentioned pretty expensive organizing industry best way talk customer expensive way talk customer hiring developer sale force expensive asset nonbillable consulting well implies making money resource expensive thing client way offset get digital sale engine connecting digital marketing digital sale resource system feed qualified lead inside sale team providing action time sale coaching objection handling using tech sort feed machine way address scale need business fifth pillar reimagining partner model getting ip run platform would effectively represent sell vertical power like pulling health care isp say `` hey listen going help put product platform actually going turn around help sell measure people success hugely beneficial u five pillar transformation really driven restructured force noted herculean change management effort thankfully able deliver pretty strong result time covid hit judson sure ended stressing everything built maybe could elaborate little bit commercial enterprise smb sale motion suddenly changed covid besides obvious sale executive rep working home covid stressed sale motion microsoft karl keirsteadyes look think put pressure u frankly karl would say first feel privileged industry frankly one ﬂick switch pretty business remotely build product remotely service customer remotely collaborate effectively organization remotely consider lucky way business shaped throughout pretty strong throughout basically enablers remote digital work right say position humility look much stressed industry right stressed segment think look area see blemish business downstream stressed customer super respectful continue hope strong recovery get pandemic condition said precise answer question look folk stressed end spectrum rolling remote work service voice/video capability persistent chat collaboration tool security requirement digitize everyone work environment inherently make vulnerable sadly bad actor slowed pandemic operated opportunistically kept security folk pin needle working customer proactively reactively throughout effectively enabling remote everything remote customer engagement remote factory operation internal operation become 100 digital much alluded digital pillar first built build infrastructure tool capability could call breadth market customer smb effectively selling digital selling pretty cool way work mean queue demand signal digital marketing effort folk work digital sale organization basically get queue 100 phone call make given day cognitive reasoning service tell call first handle objection sentiment analysis call customer allow u record know well well tracking towards meeting need blessed turning around helping customer technology microsoft us internally one sell externally got judson communicating army sale folk timing return normal call sale motion ﬂying dining back oﬃce internal microsoft messaging likely happen important giant like microsoft start returning normal cue term broadly speaking might enter recovery scenario curious judson althoff karl keirstead judson althoff yes great question look first foremost working government around world adhere local law policy microsoft operates 150 country one moment return workplace moment multiple could customer singapore india meeting microsoft counterpart managing public health requirement locally accordance policy land headquarters environment redmond washington stated open corporate campus normal operation july given employee kind notification continue prepare remote work environment interestingly enough coming though fascinating data science problem beauty built microsoft 365 platform team interface many people use enterprise sits top elaborate graph database could mash system record like sale would mash productivity data sale result engineering would mash productivity code actually measure 80 folk productive pre use data rethink corporate travel rethink corporate real estate encouraging customer cool part said make decision yes super helpful judson maybe love ask question customer conversation day environment feel like maybe open general question large enterprise spending priority changed since covid think pretty obvious initial month two much enabling remote access microsoft obviously saw team usage spike et cetera passage eight month judson november december feel like key priority big customer preparing 2021 yes say two thing really different overall sense urgency agility ruthlessness every investment need come back impactful outcome right look good ceo would saying `` hey look newsﬂash judson two thing super important time pandemic criticality think everyone face right placing increased focus two karl keirsteaddimensions certainly lot energy go faster make sure everything impactful frivolity anything interesting nice often cast wayside one thing clear technology seen answer pretty well question asked modernize like looked remotely good get data center look really good get data center looked interesting digitize process factory automation scenario connect ot capability iot simulate improve manufacturing scenario looked remotely interesting pandemic look interesting frankly way operate way produce good scale seeing really increased focus effort people extraordinarily busy helping customer across really three primary dimension would say karl one notion digital twinning call modeling data machine learning business process modeled automated done capacity whether factory curbside pickup optimization model huge body work building product running process digital capacity second category bit mentioned term microsoft internal use digital selling support always say engaging customer omnichannel capacity today probably engaging much case bulk work whether proactive reactive handling customer engagement largely effort achieve category one mentioned moment ago productivity employee base empowerment employee base modern asset measuring analytically using insight service sort three category added intensity increased agility impact bottom line result got maybe judson hit little bit one driver around getting data center faster would obviously significant positive party microsoft suite aware tech investor put undue focus azure given central satya rest team judson think evolution big enterprise stepping back deciding need change mix make cloud planning whiteboarding phase gone little bit faster actually made deal commitment azure amazon whomever third step deal actually going live way consumes compute/storage resource outside actually judson althoffsee form azure revenue journey would help frame azure outlook might look like yes sort liken thing sporting event would say hockey fan game say probably entering first intermission sort end first period would say way sort justify explanation follows first mover moved first mover actually starting recognize scale result associated investment made commerce platform today amazon ecosystem likely running asset azure today seeing result seeing pan term top line revenue ability scale enormously seeing customer move early realizing gain impact promise cloud transformation also ton learning associated first period kind use intermission term little bit okay maddening crazy intense learn advising client moving forward thing like enterprise control plane audit security capability effectively allow customer gracefully look transformation actually even look hybrid computing end state rather sort step along way journey hybrid becoming architecture stay good u look microsoft hybrid hybrid cool even called hybrid lot work going today would say term look future growth coming point consultative way engaging customer right based learning excite u portfolio unique differentiation around sort second third chapter growth cloud start probably le obvious bit advice extend customer day hey look probably chunk application portfolio move cloud big purveyor cloud platform go `` well seems counterintuitive judson reality situation look business process evolving come back notion technology always servant business application obsolescence letting go asset important pressure point opening economic ﬂywheel future innovation karl keirstead judson althofffrom also portion portfolio lifted shifted modernized per se rather thought term new code capability infusing way people frontline work team ability integrate technology call power apps end user actually hand designing workﬂow process use complete task every day serf productively far better taking old school legacy bespoke application simply moving cloud look application inspire productivity ran data center going better running rethink capability modernized ui team super helpful also look dynamic portfolio way offering saas application obsolesce legacy technology much lower cost massive ecosystem saas offering certainly compete microsoft biz apps layer also work cloud platform modern app dev revolution well revolution biggest reason acquired github seeing tremendous amount momentum realm data analytics estate really help customer get order foundation innovation cybersecurity play seven element consultative methodical plan help customer focus accelerate progress actually quite differentiated relative approach asset value bring discussion make sense appreciate hockey analogy talking canadian judson hit home got two question related azure one term microsoft competitiveness relative aws google cloud think covid crisis change enterprise priority way changed competitive dynamic among big three cloud infrastructure vendor lent advantage microsoft way worth calling group today yes look think fact microsoft trusted relationship customer long time helped certainly mindset customer fair bit microsoft infrastructure place historically pressured upper management say `` hey listen need go cloud need go cloud whichever direction thought headed please go faster beneficial u karl keirstead judson althoffi think investment made hybrid capability also help becomes decision word cloud data center logical conclusion say balance two think focus helped investment made data service extend may existing sql server investment u cloud also helping journey governance model microsoft old company transformation right result built lot governance capability fortune 500 company need think kind transformation offering back customer think hugely beneficial got maybe judson maybe continue discussion little bit way investor think server product category amy mike disclosed often viewed sort ﬂip side azure big organization reduce footprint migrate workload azure gain might lose little bit product like window server sql server database think way manage server product bucket ensure stay resilient large customer like ubs migrate aggressively cloud yes great question say top line answer karl look focused term outcome trying achieve result course shift cloud right trying artificially dictate word meter inside microsoft say `` whoa whoa whoa let accelerate cloud fast going shift business model want go fast customer want go inherently shift socket per socket workload per workload word workload ran certain number window server sql server license data center moving cloud moving workload cloud course shift stated mentioned earlier hybrid compute architecture stay let give little bit example actually think 100 shift rather satya long time talked intelligent edge intelligent cloud latter think pretty well understood former certainly confusing first uttered people like `` heck edge mean people think understood edge talked cell phone pocket maybe even wearable maybe get head around iot center increasingly putting ability compute scale reason scale edge increasingly making reality customer karl keirstead judson althoff karl keirsteadso look announcement made 5g azure stack capability scenario reasoning edge compute edge deciding cloud model propagation make lot sense customer whether addressing precision agriculture idea ubiquitous connectivity farm reality whether factory operation location want private 5g network right able reason edge important part compute architecture moving forward obviously look outside u.s. data sovereignty data residency concern propagate need edge would defense intelligence scenario need dictate see course growth cloud organically see shifting state workload socket basis also see movement edge compute scenario hopefully ... hey judson might unfair ask quantify think hybrid mean cloud edge think five ten year mix typical large enterprise spend might able bracket essentially end state might look like call ten year challenging task super hard let explain genuinely trying avoid question love yard stick meter get belief opportunity clearer total sum industry opportunity defined today much notion digital cog moving forward idea somehow inside kroger grocery store compute capability serving ad shelf edge engaging customer promotion walking store part cog environment exist today except kroger example exist scale see retail environment become truly digitized truly omnichannel see factory become digitized number factory planet digital twin simulate operation infinite scale drive carbon drive cost drive water consumption probably le 2 world factory today edge expansion tam expansion pretty material right bulk way world industrial company operate today nondigitized capacity continue learn applicability hybrid intelligent edge scenario go expansive nature tam judson althoffgot maybe last broadly demand question love ask judson clearly microsoft big enterprise software firm drive huge portion revenue larger enterprise like ubs microsoft particular long tail smb big microsoft customer well unfortunately economic crisis tail hurt amy candid last several microsoft call smb sector dragged growth little bit wondering could address microsoft sale organization dealing smb segment anything sale market motion sort bring back function frankly waiting economy improve getting snapback customer segment yes good one think first thing start smb right mean smb sort segment segment important think always start basis understanding microsoft competes commercial frame frankly extension consumer base anything else think smb small smb look bulk commercial revenue derived outside think company zero ten term employee look mentioned earlier humbly stated stated position privilege folk going lot right lot empathy customer experiencing piece business look lot like consumer business though commercial enterprise business whilst smb may compressed actually seeing pretty decent growth outside smb largely thought good idea digitize business imperative business 100 resilient digital business resilient took drive street look small business open largely figured delivery figured relationship doordashes world figured way stay engaged customer make employee continue work safely remotely closed shop deliberate caution notion privilege purveyor make possible course discounting quite bit support keeping entity aﬂoat continue get pandemic come side expect sector business thrive like said growing today maybe growing quite used bullish future karl keirstead judson althoff karl keirstead got judson talked little bit azure key microsoft story product quite central satya talking lot also increasingly conversation team maybe love ask judson two thing one team central microsoft secondly timely question interpretation slack merger might mean team growth going forward yes great question love team love team think reason understand think people get largely team equal slack plus zoom team voice video capability persistent chat sharing capability inherent slack zoom combine two together love frankly love team far actually believe team ux user experience future team way people want work team integrate team potential effectively new window u team completely open run form factor usability mobile form factor form factor growing materially bullish like app store rating team app chart term quality combined application well call capability power apps power platform creates new surface area call citizen developer person carry mobile device around go `` wow climb telephone pole electric pole service utility afterwards somehow write notebook perhaps somebody transport excel document gosh savvy enough make powerpoint presentation savvy enough make simple app dock team environment digitize way work citizen dev movement something cheering helping propagate materially think team become end user compute platform future think pretty differentiated slack acquisition salesforce give credit intelligent thing persistent chat becoming modality think going crm application salesforce core chat capability would arcane slack asset help modality business application platform make sense much exactly couple year team dynamic offering hundred application well like said capability inherent citizen dev movement judson althoff karl keirstead judson althoff karl keirsteadgot muscular slack salesforce umbrella resource ability upsold salesforce base judson make formidable rival collaboration space yes certainly make make asset modernized think sale cloud user marketing cloud user service cloud user slack becomes integrated environment make asset stickier certainly dynamic front strengthens competitive dynamic offering productivity play standpoint salesforce really productivity offering would offer probably judson opinion microsoft opinion per se offer broadly actually distraction take like salesforce going kind sale pursuit driving workplace modernization employee empowerment effort customer okay judson much time question get one perfect segue conversation ask read loud see microsoft getting directly involved enterprise telephony continue lean heavily carrier ucaas partner going forward yes good question see zero sum quite frankly great partnership telco provider around world actually see relationship strengthening look take network asset cloud modernize platform actually becomes plumbing telco operate certainly edge cloud paradigm described earlier telco essential voice video payload something perfect team telco know microsoft thing frankly whether use cisco webex whether use zoom bluejeans thing today idea somehow going telco offering versus something come top market reality think telco see looking monetize outside core experience look successful team strategy microsoft strategy excludes telco fact see need even stronger partnership moving forward judson althoff karl keirstead judson althoff karl keirstead judson althoffgot time one sneak one completely different question judson keep toe investor asking whether microsoft plan create chip compete apple m1 chip matter aws produce chip use azure vms well yes hand chip design already xbox xcloud offering actually interesting one pretty excited gaming ecosystem one crossover realm consumer commercial super exciting u area business ca comment space apple move certainly interesting one studying partnership though realm open ai effort relationship intel arm development certainly point need advanced capability whether build ecosystem partner sort yet disclosed excellent judson end thank mike spencer ir team agreeing keynote event spend much time client behalf ubs judson thanks much carving time today u thanks karl pleasure okay thank bye
