2020 give confidence started see towards end 2019 catherine go come back really intrigued intersection technology consumer demand procter breakout talked little bit shared example toothbrush increased compliance could see spot addressed tooth extraction specific example example snacking yes think thing early day think actually gotten sharpest term leveraging technology snacking right whereas previously lot people said gee impulse product worried impulse nature snacking relates sort view opposite actually talk individual consumer much directly actually create demand consumer much directly specific may particularly like sun chip right sun chip product terrific product u brand hard put display get display get display much one bigger brand ca necessarily justify end cap whereas ali ph may
