good afternoon everyone welcome session last certainly least vivek arya semiconductor analyst bank america merrill lynch absolutely delighted rob csongor nvidia head nvidia investor relation team like session let keep interactive also go series question session go question 20 25 minute open ﬂoor q rob welcome thank thanks vivek maybe let start high level could give u state union see term spending environment participate number different consumer enterprise market feel optimistic le optimistic right talk near term go trend okay think overall mostly optimistic one fundamental dynamic visual computing becoming critical variety different market currently existing customer existing market like pc gaming think one first question people ask nvidia `` possible gpu business growing fourth consecutive year row pc vivek arya rob csongormarket declining answer address entire pc market address segment pc market one segment pc gaming second professional workstation within market demand visual computing voracious look business see asp trend going driving asp trend gross margin going look overall market gaming market growing 16 billion year 20 billion 2015 first market serve fundamentally growing within workstation market even last year even though last year declining segment largely stable business think actually even though sound weird actually good news u quadro business stable midst one worst year ever think say market robust beyond gpus going new market include segment like compute ramping business grid new business putting gpus data center streaming graphic think one part business part business tegra would describe new device new type computing device number thing going fundamentally see lot dynamic driving gaming continues 76 revenue google make people tablet play game believe nvidia uniquely positioned unique core competency drive market let maybe go market starting gpu nvidia pioneer market one thing look market last five year market ﬂattish seen share shift amd last three year done exceptionally well market share gone almost 68 two question fair think overall buy gpus sort fixed outsized performance come share gain case much room gain share market would say right way look business gpu business grew four consecutive year row mean share grew four consecutive year row correlated vivek arya rob csongor vivek aryawhat mean overall market demand gpus grew either either sold product higher price people think share story yes grew share amd question come going happen share think bottom line amd competitor still competitor whatever issue gone away expect compete going compete hard ever consumes u consumes u think number one feed best product gamers number two meet need new compute opportunity take grid enable visual computing experience pc kind display thing allow u drive business lot design win competing competitor trend among whether channel whether oem would prefer give whatever 70 market share think since lot business go channel mainly gamers end day determine whether would buy nvidia geforce whether would buy amd radeon gpu regardless exists particular customer term implying vendor management best strategy know create demand product develop product value gamer develop product value scientist ultimately believe drive business happens within pc gaming space gaming done pc gamers building channel know channel system builder upgrade thing like think even regardless whether channel whether oems nvidia direct relationship gamers something think unique technology company think ultimately going focus attention talking earlier think making interesting point trend notice whenever new game console cycle sometimes contrary people would assume game console come market capture attention perhaps pc gaming go case could elaborate two new big console supposed come next quarter rob csongor vivek arya rob csongor yes well first overall perspective guess every time cycle game console always little different twenty year ago first joined nvidia game console 100 time powerful pc idea spending 60 game selling 50 title one person conceivable way get 3d graphic experience time game console world today exist today pc 100 time powerful game console game console rev performance level pc stimulate lot content developed would describe pc content becomes available pc market result see stimulation part business pc level typically past seen game console business think seen gpu business point people say `` oh playing pc game anymore going go game console think case today think increasingly course lot issue model game market today game market example android 600 million user price start free go 0.99 1.99 7.99 reason work developer 600 million user know 76 google revenue game certainly big market think question right way serve market think nvidia strategy right much focused open platform pc android open platform business long time think whole gaming market lot casual gamer served tablet player mentioned android enabler gamer served pc game gpu business solution room market game console especially try really medium hub several alternative medium hub actually tell going question let say game console market take game developer enough incentive even develop something pc gaming market attention going form factor vivek arya rob csongorso right system data presented recently share data website survey done gdc game developer conference platform choice according survey right mobile arm iphone ipads android 51 51 said platform choice second platform choice pc gaming 16 billion market going 20 billion 48 game console came 14 saying anything want ask game console ask people saying certainly position developer attention question data would suggest right developer focus primarily open platform mean mobile pc lastly gpu business every year intel launch new product claim `` well graphic much better time graphic really much better think haswell branded separately like highest end call iris look design win haswell platform first think haswell platform obviously matter right gpu business adoption platform secondly see change graphic attach rate big graphic versus move towards integrated graphic want first comment said number thing first thing said true haswell graphic better ivy bridge ivy bridge better sandy bridge sandy bridge better came question better guarantee next version integrated graphic better haswell question replace professional workstation graphic card answer replace pc gamer graphic card thing say even take answer tell answer read review yesterday article came yesterday tom hardware read review summary article basically integrated graphic better way gamer professional workstation ever going replace card integrated graphic reason haswell integrated graphic thing got better kepler discrete gpus got better also part story missing question integrated graphic solution good enough gaming workstation answer vivek arya rob csongor yes make sense maybe let shift discussion tegra favored son guess company tegra know year expectation sale expected ﬂattish take growth seeing tegra automotive side selling 20 processor selling complete dollar module implies part tegra going year year market growing substantially much product transition issue much market share issue could walk u tegra expected ﬂat year market growing think first think fairly timing issue talked made conscious decision move schedule tegra 4 order move schedule tegra 4i integrated part lte modem well move schedule apps processor logan logan brings kepler tegra made tradeoff made tradeoff revenue versus believe right strategic thing grow tegra business long term term revenue obviously mean order ﬂat year would obviously much revenue loaded second half year dissimilar last year remembered last year actually tegra 2 ramped tegra 3 start ramping basically business word tablet start built start released midyear ramp second half fall peak christmas go look revenue lumpy get bigger every year lumpy like term second half revenue several new revenue stream exist year tegra exist last year automotive one automotive right run rate roughly 100 million 120 million year ramping nicely introduced gaming device year called shield shield go shelf month obviously revenue exist last year case asp much higher think thing difference last year year last year actually tablet really obviously nexus 7 obviously kindle fire hd part lot people sideline tablet think year going change think year see lot tablet android everywhere see lot tablet lot skus lot type tablet different vendor vivek arya rob csongorthen finally think going see tegra going new type device tegra ultimately going phone tablet fact think even really refer tegra anymore mobile business simply new computing device think tegra think going see tegra roadmap basically every part nvidia business going forward basically delivery vehicle gpu something x86 platform one think positive surprise work nvidia done 4g lte bought icera business radio certainly expect come actually 4g lte capability tested certified actually putting 4g lte modem smartphone tablet today qualcomm 100 market market demanding good second source good product broadcom claim good product intel marvell make press announcement every day competitive perspective 4g lte going differentiator versus qualcomm dominates market today think mentioned earlier believe visual computing increasingly important device look competition see increasingly talking graphic visual computing think accident think tablet new type device disruptive pc deliver visual experience used get pc market going care much visuals cost battle large percentage market visual computing going extremely important competition know look market data mentioned twice already say 76 google revenue coming game angry bird madden 13 lot end type graphic application think visual computing whether going automobile whether going gaming device whether going phone tablet increasingly going require visual computing nvidia phone market address market volume segment market lte lte modem lte modem allows u go door leverage visual computing expertise meantime competition everything improve graphic visual computing vivek arya rob csongorbut fortunately nvidia visual computing hard think look lot people thought would easy simply license arm core imagination graphic core think lot people realizing simple think qualcomm understands complex really lot licensing core actually investing heavily graphic visual computing think lte modem important component ultimately ultimately differentiation visual computing got maybe push back little bit visual computing part pc gpu side strong graphic think pioneer bringing lot capability smartphones tablet look qualcomm adreno graphic broadcom graphic capability simon segars arm present saying mali graphic going go probably going double year many imagination course apple claim course iphone ipads play game better anyone else better product graphic enabled believe much better graphic propel market share phone right point making saying matter lot different device yesterday yesterday computex asus announced several tablet pick mali pick intel pick competitor mentioned picked nvidia tegra 4 ask `` need level visual computing think answer seeing lot dynamic happening new device fact increasingly word thing used matter visual computing 10 year ago graphic pretty look today increasingly visual computing keep using word `` visual computing instead graphic graphic graphic look increasingly order make game example realistic worried graphic worried object behave water behave like water move character clothes ﬂow hair ﬂow increasingly think compute capability gpu increasingly important think application computer vision think compute pc imagine could mobile device look tegra device going car looking overhead view car backing look window camera vivek arya rob csongor vivek aryaﬂoating car looking side creating graphical view look like looking compute well graphic together visual computing fortunately u hard one thing look integration capability mentioned application processor modem look competitor whether qualcomm broadcom mediatek along application processor modem also connectivity capability power management screen controller developing rf capability power amplification see market developing need add capability internally something may acquire outside like icera modem side even necessary yes guess question guess one question critical thing need order win certain design asus tablet announced yesterday think connectivity decided win think visual computing think lot integration various component may matter segment market segment nvidia address typically think integration think cost reduction mean connectivity rf using component overall impact think gross margin thing happens thing counter word spend engineering resource either integrating chiclets else develop something example developed prism capability allows reduce backlight display 40 result use expensive memory save 7.00 bom using software modem software modem 50 size overall chip tegra 4 half size competition much powerful cost contributor whether integrate something know mean lot way look overall bom cost device enable question unique leverageable know put list together thing could reduce bom cost important thing u look growth though market indeed coming part market would part market rob csongor vivek arya q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participantvalue processor baseband integration believe market opportunity enable mainstream price point perspective cost would agree would say matter matter much much low end low end cost segment addressing cost please let open audience question answer thank thanks commentary nvidia successful competing guess intel even though significant process laid foundry managed continue competitive wonder anything changed look discussion altera obviously gone think something changed process lead significant enough perhaps threaten graphic integrated graphic thanks good question get question quite bit process technology one component differentiation fortunately nvidia differentiator architecture one way could say apple 20 time faster orange matter well build orange know mean word end day architecture gpu allows accelerate application far beyond integrated graphic cpu could matter process could build cpu make sense word process matter much much let say two part identical two x86 competing le one better process case process huge strategic weapon club case gpus versus cpu integrated graphic architecture trump process okay great thanks cost side question since look like rather expensive number cost high node guy still interested think competitive 20 would like skip go straight 16 thin set rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor actually communicated roadmap recently gpu technology conference variety different roadmaps involve 20 thin set much devil detail discussion timing performance pricing dizzying analysis actually looking right roadmap okay think competitive thin set like said really disclosed much beyond order really answer question get detail product timing look presentation material simply see exist roadmap really disclosed detail okay great thanks announcement arm recently new core wondering seen thought intimately familiar arm yes course yes familiar announcement nothing new term announcement talk today think know unique license arm unique variant arm 9 went tegra 4i specifically targeted perf per square millimeter case use something shelf case something little different little bit ﬂexibility highly enthusiastic arm roadmap gpus traditionally one earliest adopter moore law pack transistor get better performance market demand performance willing pay given like historical animosity versus intel several year last couple year least thing settled part would consider using intel foundry partner came would go make use potentially altera say going advantage q vivek arya rob csongor q vivek arya q unidentified participant rob csongoryes think would happy look think ask intel though think intel set certain requirement work think ask sure yes intel great manufacturer obviously lot great process technology whether use good u good industry advanced process technology anyway good question ask intel ready ready yes would say would look always talk everybody think people know work tsmc reason good said mean talk everybody ultimately another one devil detail believe reason would look question commented 51 gamers preferred platform mobile obviously lot opportunity mobile also commented several time asp increase wondering happens overall balance mix asp mobile becomes bigger piece versus say pc still get blended average asp increase start see shift maybe mobility requires better price point could talk little bit yes sure yes good question referring originally pc gaming business vivek asked question asking driving pc side pc gaming asp gone think may aware announced product year called titan titan selling 1,000 card sold asp within pc market continue grow gross margin know record gross margin last quarter think driven large part asp growth overall pointed looking overall business tegra right lower asp point slightly lower corporate gross margin tegra ramp grows much higher percentage would drag margin thing pushing margin growth opportunity tesla side tesla far corporate gross margin q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participantwe announced new use gpus go server called grid grid gpus go either dell hp cisco server accelerate citrix may seen announcement two week ago citrix synergy citrix new xendesktop 7 accelerated nvidia grid product announced jointly ceo citrix ceo nvidia onstage together growth business pushing growing gross margin overall tegra highly strategic large market opportunity slightly corporate average gross margin put take thank impressed new lte integrated tegra chip first congratulation may ask smartphone currently adopted great new tegra 4i including lte modem first nothing talk today please stay tuned okay sure yes currently right tegra 4i guess latest milestone maybe talk tegra 4i mobile world congress surprised think world showing lte running mobile world congress running running phone meaning within power within performance limitation phone time competition showed advanced lte sixty day later ctia two week ago showed cat 4 lte 150 megabit per second running running chip word spin silicon advantage nvidia modem radio able deliver advanced lte capability using exact chip within 60 day think powerful demonstration ﬂexibility design ﬂexibility modem capability think one milestone tegra 4i see delivering lte advanced lte next milestone track data certification lte q3 voice data certification q4 somewhere hope able answer question asking customer maybe question perspective handset maker way better using combo integrated chip tegra plus lte maybe 500 modem chip separately tegra 4 conventional way better customer thank rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor q vivek arya rob csongor q vivek arya sure think super phone phone would describe 199 use tegra 4 i500 think focus really tegra 4i tegra 4i focused sweet spot mainstream smartphone market 99 199 segment think really focusing effort integrated chip better inaudible phone integrated chip clearly designed perf per square millimeter perf per watt smartphone think end allotted time thank everyone thank rob thank much vivek appreciate participation
