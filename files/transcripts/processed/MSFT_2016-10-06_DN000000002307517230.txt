recorded available playback bottom slide window notice adjust volume maximize screen feel free ask question submitting one right slide address question conclusion presentation little bit bloomberg intelligence provides analysis data set industry company government esg credit economic litigation impact business decision backed 300 plus data provider delivered buy sell recommendation analyst team average 20 plus year research experience bi exclusively provided client subscribe bloomberg professional service accessed bi go without ado hand mickey robert presentation followed question mickey thanks mandeep hello everyone thanks joining u today today want talk cloud see everything going robert work together help bring information client idc first thing like understand see cloud part call third platform also tied mobility social side business data analytics think important part understand cloud new baseline need actually bring change going overall perspective look cover area enterprise application find know operating model really shifted license maintenance support cloud subscription standpoint robert mahowaldsee expect trend continue also see reason going need cloud going changing well really see information come data set information external world iot internet thing artificial intelligence cognitive whole host thing driving ability cloud even past talk like think cloud baseline get next step going see lot change already occurred going see continuing path even quicker pace seen already robert going move next slide yes mickey said cloud definitely product operationalized sold cloud service definitely fast grower software look know worldwide software market 2015 growth 4.75 think growth know maintenance plus subscription plus license next five year expected cagr little bit little 5.25 largely driven staying power among ability sap oracle others keep company maintenance enterprise user license agreement kind sort driving software remainder saas service cloud service anything software operationalized delivered service call cloud software broadly depending capability market sold growth rate next five year anywhere 90 ph 85 really significant would say slow growth area like maybe financial planning manufacturing apps data management analytics suiting fast grower slide use characterize cloud economy way way vendor anybody want interact cloud economy make money left side kind know think core cloud service built something serviced operationalized part cost good sold selling subscription cloud service many many form metered gigabit minute even second case ph like aws lambda way software application software say really customer look feel much look lot like packaged software way paid technical diﬃculty paying perhaps year upfront might paying might paying year time nothing like quite like granular metered service think think cloud broadly application provider really sort engineered system work would say also becomes true talking company like sap oracle using thing like subscription credit place payment customer got residual maintenance due contract company want switch saas version whatever software maybe business suite want maintain kind fixed schedule benefit know buyer seller degree equally provides lot predictability buyer cloud service left side thing think think cloud service cloud component middle slide call arm dealer equation looking market inaudible familiar idc black book clearly everything cover across information technology communication world thinking product made work well cloud technical diﬃculty whether open tenancy know whether hosted know whether designed grid compute inaudible service management product example really really important cloud world ability tap technical diﬃculty heterogeneous asset thing like cmdb technical diﬃculty change management governance asset live different place idc looking world hardware software service sold enterprise build enterprise private cloud service provider isvs type saying know something functionally different product matter sort market structure vendor say make right customer buying intention deploying would call cloud perhaps private cloud enterprise got know virtualization automation scripting et cetera think private cloud product used way huge huge market would say sort little bit different cloud service market going lift shift going lot customer saying know want move something much lot lift well got different category software brought together one provider sold service customer customer getting probably would gotten otherwise bought piece separately course paying lift cloud component world really kind pie slowly turning one slice two slice and/or probably staying kind big world long time got set component serving traditional would call first second platform business part business got sold cloud delivery know cloud instantiation middle segment cloud economy slide right got management professional service everything network consulting business consulting system integration like ph across board everything need either get customer road cloud isv example big si help customer continue use optimize consumption public virtual hosted private cloud service example lot know lot day one would call day one system integration stuff done get company figure rationalize portfolio figure provides value company continues provide value based utilization provides value run locally might provide value run locally might still provide value ran place also ran provider going equation kind day one road cloud stuff really space also greater extent especially global si figured real opportunity helping customer ongoing integration optimization consumption cloud service moving world even infrastructure level guess probably predominantly mostly infrastructure level somewhere middle tier well going able operational arbitrage around cost function among provider enough provider basic core capability coming market handful engine coming making arbitrage possible kind stuff arbitrage optimization heavily leveraged big si helping large company figure use cloud consume thing well work well call maturing cloud service around becoming understood people kind get make money would say emerging side industry cloud service industry cloud topic idc covering two year putting lot time effort year brieﬂy say centered around real center gravity player industry look name see company either early certain niche mickey north rizzamarkets else industry leader market whether know pharma manufacturing automotive raw material know biotech et cetera notion industry cloud place would everything hosting data analytics transaction also place provide specific regulatory compliance governance even case like aws govcloud indemnification essentially assurance behind saying ensure limit sla sued found default made open damaging audit technical asset providing really typically get provider cloud service even professional managed service degree industry cloud something think really big deal say second big aspect industry cloud spent much time platform company built customer others even industry peer well able build new custom code durable code sold consumed also becoming marketplace company understand important thing technology kind table stake important thing compliance unique set software asset access know work alongside know core product using kind way industry cloud take u next slide please okay mickey slide yes slide looking number acquisition cloud software look overall perspective see grown rapidly something consider cloud acquisition two three one depending upon area looking premise software think robert great job describing earlier market look like company going cloud know look look top company cloud 2016 salesforce eight nine acquisition krux yesterday announcement data management side also see oracle seven accenture google six microsoft six cisco five ibm five amazon four apple four know pick know top 20 really look seeing look trend awful lot cloud purchase see lot ai data set anything digital robert mahowaldtransformation world taking beyond third platform got cloud basic adding cloud infrastructure getting next standpoint say information piece need platform piece need round offering think know robert great job last slide talking cloud service whole emerging area coming think somebody like ford microsoft invested pivotal basically know pivotal connected driver organization bringing automation aspect represent cloud well starting see company come together may thought past really make difference end product selling bring consumer market overall aspect quick snapshot acquisition cloud becoming greater greater see chart let see next slide robert okay great might hard see meant build slide essentially notion talk reason company acquire acquire clearly experience looking software broadly acquirees sort focused mix traditional packaged software saas/cloud service would say last couple year particularly drive simply desire buy capability net new capability buying capability understand software work well get cheaper multiple going far le fully operationalized cloud service run rate subscriber wing know cost cost capability pretty much key driver decides kind company buy know business relationship partnership lot thing really would note last two year think data bear desire buy company call cloud shop much stronger think sense urgency come especially larger vendor like oracle microsoft ibm sap particularly understand really opportunity big way think sort left side chart previously want complete cloud company mean got operationalize set service got consumer hardware software got sort orient professional service operation got full range developer service application service infrastructure service network compute storage need going necessarily lot differentiator need get level ability compete total cloud level know idc belief great sense urgency customer also vendor say also customer rationalize portfolio move lot stuff cloud property quickly possible certainly seen amazon desire cut price thing like amazon snowball three time last 18 month trying get customer massive volume data cloud also made free many case data streaming product move certain amount data know given day cloud operational analysis storage desire get customer move lot urgency right think desire buy acquire software capability able total cloud strong think going point know depending big customer feel strategic safety around focusing inaudible one vendor risk sure opportunity get spend pie think larger one get customer navigate transition cloud say customer say core sap application take care also get customer start building platform putting data platform start using adjacent partner application platform find tremendous amount gravity around customer activity platform buying right kind capability becomes much important say key message know round functional portfolio run business cloud app thing really important customer make sure need ideally build something know functional parity customer experience packaged application often diﬃcult two figure need complete set workﬂows important customer sell one thing say know say know talent management need thing like review management social sourcing new capability piece kind small point piece see really bought important right normalize balance sheet also super important report oracle quarter last quarter 80 growth saas portfolio organic growth around fusion portfolio really 40 know really le half growth even consider pipeline mickey north rizza robert mahowaldand message oracle figured know early needed need taleo eloqua rightnow company bought substantial customer stream help normalize balance sheet make big transition allows put good face otherwise poor quarter hardware lost 12 software license think 0.5 par maintenance 9 allows lead saas normalize balance sheet folk would say know point slide written slide little year old 45 plus saas 25 million potential target would say level mickey went track time number actually quite bit probably know track idc know product call cloudshare track 2,400 vendor around world 400 made little 20 million 2015 big saas property independent saas property exception workday couple others snapped heretofore think sort next wave going much market would call long tail saas going talk minute investigating know functional capability geography know management team partner et cetera kicking tire really looking company bought lower multiple big name yet sure mickey want take slide want nope go ahead roll moved could see long tail start focusing really talked market sure yes absolutely know typically software market find know competitor one two three pecking order another right depending mature market know 20 60 think looking another 40 market lot variability got mature segment cloud software immature segment cloud software make lot sense cloud software idc includes application system infrastructure software thing like storage software archiving service management security et cetera part saas see kind look middle slide si service also included cloud software idc piece see growth time particular see importance key incumbent vendor know key set incumbent vendor think could probably take picture little bit exception quickbase pretty much financial management application space know technical diﬃculty sale consumer think everybody else think rush urgency sudden serve different kind functional piece customer technical capability need know company like salesforce course even point microsoft course application big oracle application huge thing past 10 year pushing market like oracle know operationalizing enterprise business suite itsm set product cloud business suite something allows customer technical diﬃculty resource management governance really big obviously know java developer cloud building fully ﬂedged announced last openworld fully ﬂedged service customer take granular bite basis computing storage set product kind stuff kind desire show slide show time really ﬂushes diversity big player desire think go forward time take get kind functional diversity look long tail defined change know lot work modeling work around many isvs world isv defined case cloud isv right 25,000 isvs know broadly probably 5,500 isv make money money delivering fully operationalized subscription service customer look entry market mean really long tail new new also sure company know maybe stuck space maybe third platform space really serving customer particularly know say maybe point sale software really needed kind service revenue know going talk mean next slide big deal right look stats mean read well enter life market enablers know whole set company glommed university glommed onto big isvs middleware database provider good idea say know want grow business want saas business know cheap way get access infrastructure really lot work figuring small business get started kind business functionally big driving demand get tool asset need start business many case know ibm oracle microsoft even amazon know give tool create grow business get run rate sharing kind model get bigger thing change look splitting big sort middle company start get understand business got customer reached certain run rate looking around diﬃculty growing next level start either entertain offer start conversation may start core partnership big database middleware distribution vendor kind think next wave going come lot big company really got clear intention buying marquee name got set customer hopefully completely know replicative selling long time provide functionality know need time need speed market ca really hope build right got lot work around long tail software entire software universe change time net new smaller company coming different degree hybrid hybrid talking specifically kind revenue company make diverse revenue stream happy talk bloomberg share next slide slide lot work update time think key thing understand technical diﬃculty build look cloud software revenue broadly vendor 90 cloud pretty large growth trajectory piece portfolio delivered right vendor technical diﬃculty see see little bit lower right know could company list company may make small amount revenue delivering cloud service remind people time company even substantial revenue like microsoft example still probably make le 7 total revenue delivering cloud service way think represents relatively slow nature change industry think software market mickey look even 2020 see getting 22 23 revenue coming buying subscription service rest various call first second platform service huge installed base slow churn slow convinced need requirement necessity value making transition look packaged software revenue vendor mentioned cagr period 5.5 interesting important thing understand company revenue stream know company idc track broadly software tracker little 5,000 company work understand think share pie growth pie revenue project 2020 le 1 basically growth pie different every know functional market whether know database hosting know erp whatever growth market average company make money delivery le 1 shot le 1 growth time share lot vendor client important understand know either strong compelling reason going go customer want move cloud thing like update know single set capability time internal customer et cetera also mean also significant benefit provider know significant telling company like oracle moving know working hard moving higher higher gross margin service portfolio company look around 40 oracle around 65 goal move toward 80 gross margin service offering company figured operationalize service get eﬃcient deliver deliver understood one coming like fast train two need get shop understand work world three chance take growth greatly diminished hard work whether merger whether know building set service walking customer hard step get mandeep singh robert mahowaldboards understand understands technical diﬃculty understand think vendor customer understand message yes great thought fascinating conversation know whole aspect long tail cloud think help put thing perspective way thing going cloud mean recall correctly whole thing started private equity took right bought cvent marketo vista equity partner bought two company back early year idea clear point time know way wave going making acquisition company huge cash ﬂow really picked saw mega deal year microsoft bought buying linkedin salesforce buying demandware oracle buying netsuite curious driving deal optimism year like seen much bigger deal year seen cloud far guy like kind note around reason around seeing bigger deal year yes let give answer mickey sure got good thought yes know would say last opportunity snap big successful saas property matter multiple take set competition think know long time oracle know used larry ellison used stage openworld make fun salesforce think anybody making fun salesforce anymore figured diversify product set sell pretty much part organization sale suite think driven fear think fear somebody else simply step buy know example oracle bought netsuite several bidder sort drop think netsuite seen company successfully managed know worth spending know 3.5 billion whatever spent netsuite know got netsuite shareholder set big established customer gaga netsuite netsuite way figured bring partner know like financialforce namely brought piece pie functionally could bring think instilled fear heart big apps provider think drive pressure acquire somebody big spend lot money point know really think workday know anybody really big real valuable property core enterprise application space mickey north rizza mandeep singh mickey north rizza mandeep singh mickey north rizzacommand would say course salesforce think salesforce maybe reached point stratosphere outright buy would pretty darn diﬃcult think merger likely yes great yes would agree well add one caveat think much buying next big thing trying beat competition also think trying add two thing one customer side second product side trying use myriad bring innovation marketplace keep grabbing market share really think shift pure operational aspect bringing information better job capitalizing quicker know think marketplace rate change based technology right software package type industry general huge much significant last 20 30 let say 40 year great topic since said company larger guy looking acquire market share know basically like buying smaller cloud guy area enterprise software think right consolidation point maybe talk specifically specific segment know see need consolidation think finance one area still awful lot finance cloud provider hcm really taken procurement one taken lot consolidation go probably behind time area need point time enterprise asset management going see continue already gone quite bit order management guess crm hot topic obviously everything salesforce robert thought supply chain would want robert mahowald yes would say know obviously got got great slide wish add got call functional market atomic size market example know treasury risk inside financial management inside erp inside application granular level definitely niche player provide piece portfolio slightly bigger company like infor example would epicor would love able bring table customer able afford build enough customer space think thought couple three year ago well approached space partnership customer ask say example board operation board operation saas service lot little player pick partner among think seeing gradually le interesting large organization enterprise application integration stitch together various provider set slas maybe set data integration process integration think willing say know much partnership okay get capability need would really like see capability come one dashboard one place make tactical integration something along line think message hearing buy somebody else build capability one place think even provider saas provider erp broadly starting say need think buying capability know understand lo behold started really small saas provider grown size got complex sized large customer got complex need need acquire capability niche area functional market level really big would say last piece would talk industry application company like know epicor oracle infor particularly netsuite well think netsuite built pretty successful offering retail apparel example made sequel spent last two year building vertical practice think desire get operation manufacturing resource supply chain application really really lot functional domain expertise really designed particular industry really segment term amount saas revenue driven guy sort started small stayed small sort one relatively niche space think desire get bigger broader mandeep singh robert mahowald mandeep singhworld think set vendor know though broad work poised buy capability serve industry customer security mean saw one big deal year symantec blue coat cloud deal still many point solution provider security space think going see activity know really good question would say possible give couple answer one think ask customer enterprise customer responsible security outside firewall example know network transport firewall thing like know vpn transporter encrypted endpoint virtual private cloud example sits provider lot desire push network security big isp vpn provider push cloud security either saas provider core set cloud provider whether rackspace google microsoft amazon softlayer ibm say well happens inside firewall something got add visibility really technical diﬃculty think changing little bit company realize live cloud world way watch packet got managed uniform way slas core set provider outside firewall really cover need covered think look set know sort dsn sorry dns provider know core malware provider think know going lot capability buy think really big planned security around around around network transport security network visibility whole network player like akamai dyn example maybe layer 9 maybe f5 network kind player think kind broad picture security seems top mind company trying push world build management network soup nut okay reminder everyone submit question webinar link please feel free still 10 minute want move service kind deal expect accenture acquisitive last one year see trend part robert mahowald mickey north rizza robert mahowald yes mickey work quite analyst look space conversation think important thing service guy buying much area need bringing workforce need look number know thing found know accenture greatest acquisition since 2012 number acquisition really interesting look deloitte past guess 10 15 month quite bit hit acquisition phase really look accenture seems meeting list long suite actually buying think going find going continue need help help company move forward new acquisition technology bringing also understanding business process going change really see continue evolve robert know thought yes think company gsis particularly start use somebody else case amazon case accenture amazon really really say spread across provider parked asset elsewhere think focus change people operation developer people got domain capability practice big data dx example think mind buying people know coding got know thought leadership expertise understand market moving buy domain expert company think really somebody understands maybe fed space maybe manufacturing maybe retail really really well durable code sell know think even important anymore whether got customer whether know operationalized going matter much anymore need people really run physical asset anymore think expect see order magnitude purchase smaller buy know smaller team functional domain experience mandeep singh robert mahowald mandeep singhhave got coding ability understand domain really well kind like talked little bit software side going acquired think really domain industry player biggest great moving mentioned industry cloud think couple big success story veeva one term clubbed together functional area analytics regulatory compliance really shown steady growth last year term addressable market mean going hit wall point think industry cloud consolidation going take place yes think actually side curve think really growth curve going see diversity player know across industry start emerge think consolidation start happen probably happen much reﬂexively growth happens consolidation happen think player really center gravity industry start edge see wisdom glomming onto somebody else cloud sort virtuous cycle technical diﬃculty demand developer want lot customer place bet would say consolidation come technical diﬃculty winnowing among company smaller hope big hope center gravity industry know building industry cloud see company really kind know huge place customer life huge place industry start sell industry cloud technical diﬃculty much concerned technical aspect industry cloud sort table stake past perspective understand really action always say know industry cloud know company really inaudible name name much say progress software got really tremendous burning need develop go make money tremendous burning need need software work progress database environment really go really sort create need think successful entry cloud player stay drive transition one create question one listener asking best positioned provide cloud service federal government civilian side especially defense side robert mahowald mandeep singh robert mahowald yes would say area got whole team government analyst look think ph government know fedramp whole host dfca whole host requirement notion become apply certification gain certification really diﬃcult tactical challenge requires great degree physical digital isolation platform essentially know degree break model public cloud requires example amazon skate business software go business requires know build something net new expectation know federal government entity business follow know buildup say hurdle quite high would expect many company go step become example fedramp qualified always think wise move platform economy sort leverage know leverage high capital cost provide set digital service transformation service top think successful successful formula yes would say four five analyst government insight business think think talk stuff time great talk talking amazon wrap like guy amazon microsoft google guy acquire know kind enhance competitive positioning cloud already dominated kind acquisition would guy looking point going looking three year road almost kind kind would put practice really thought could somebody already pretty well certainly thing like iot thing like think getting bringing functional capability said earlier really think race move lot customer stuff one big mega cloud provider start absorb spend pie think understanding know complex customer problem even really know yet would try acquire think know talked folk amazon google microsoft particularly lot think lot something verging hubris term think build mickey north rizza robert mahowald mandeep singh robert mahowaldand think probably right technical engineering standpoint level saying somebody day inaudible mickey day talking team amazon two people whose full time job fully optimize 246 supply part get level optimization using odm pretty much everything build mean got sense build create service sell think said two stuff think might willing maybe something like governance message queue iot side data rationalization already know data warehouse functional file object block store kind piece would need iot kind offering think think amazon maybe somewhat separate case would say microsoft little bit different think microsoft know built data center capability mega scale provider would put slightly different provider perspective think still gain still application space unlike one named think still gain buying security provider desktop virtualization provider buying know application provider bigger portfolio sure would say mickey idea think right track really going said gain market share quick grab quick put together next step really moving faster think even human mind fathom overall perspective yes multiple speaker sorry go complete thought please last piece forgot mention really ai machine learning think still convinced work done application cognitive team convinced much kind capability take core application provider particularly way league seen microsoft salesforce oracle sap kind capability announced tell know visiting friend waldorf couple week ago talking salesforce mandeep singh mickey north rizza robert mahowaldextensively capability know really want able complete whole workﬂow customer around ai part application transformation piece something think sort tier mega cloud provider particularly application space big deal think technical diﬃculty need support got get big marketplace application provider run use infrastructure lot company say need capability well whole idea message queue data rationalization et cetera machine learning great time would encourage everyone take look report bloomberg intelligence published terminal available terminal user thank much mickey robert wonderful learned much really enjoyed discussion hope everyone found useful look forward future webinars thank thank thanks time
