transition talk u kind term sort moving oﬃce 365 seat growth overall commercial base think surprised people upside still room go mean start q side equation seat growing keith question sometimes long need bring notebook think start got even real focus speech got pulled straight think actually asked q part remember guessing since key seat growth really get guessing price q could asked multiple speaker could really killed equation work mean going excel time easier back user really think way look back decade almost long talking oﬃce 365 microsoft 365 ability land solution think probably

competitive think suite certainly offer compelling value got good room well got ever time see e7 sku functionality come suite interesting get asked lot could see excel go 135 decent question 7 would tell though right lot focus whether continue think seen u move little bit path whether better offering standalone solution would sell addition e5 may call suite say thing like viva terrific example viva monetized mostly outside suite experience resonating incredibly well customer around world really started talking releasing early component desire employer able real pulse term employee engagement employee learning skilling right blast type think example would think sure right move put suite got great standalone value people adopt deploy directly direct sale make ton sense thing think lot new would call productivity tool may fact look little bit like consumption would normally associate azure maybe backend limit right would deploy use put pay otherwise guess value pricing think tend limit scope microsoft 365 oﬃce 365 concept say suite must user pretty narrow actually would say pretty narrow believe narrow narrow cloud opportunity footprint got came head necessarily e7 offering like natural extension seen power vi going e5 suite power platform broadly two leg stool hearing good indication lot customer demand automating amy hood q keith wei amy hood q keith weissthose process dig little bit term sort opportunity around power platform guy seeing initial fraction yeah think ask hey term proactive conversation customer bring tool would near top list think

wanted talk dynamic 365 think part story math sort growth trajectory dynamic 365 versus amy hoodother sort big saas company think servicenow salesforce workday dynamic 365 right along leader servicenow within said passed 4 billion kind annualized run rate good anything seen saas working side equation couple year ago guy able scale like potential basis yeah think think taking journey p l interesting next literally visually p l inaudible make sense excel spreadsheet team done nice job five year ago said importantly think realized needed make dynamic 365 addition modern business process reinvention application set needed module ca ever say word ph mud juvarized even sure word said point needed make smaller consumable piece right easier deploy quicker time value applicable industry solution team done great tool focused go market say well really make dynamic 365 different two thing make lot difference course also applicability microsoft cloud problem really trying solve start saying number one need focus data problem need access right data make good business process decision secondly want apply ai problem make decision making effective eﬃcient finally want make tool accessible think dynamic focused thing enabled fact microsoft cloud lot ability sitting platform layer help dynamic team achieve goal think really innovative way also took frankly investment sale side sale process little different business application take time importantly sell different people thought lot people buying community inside organization member people budget inside orgs spend much time nature business really think dynamic applicable judson head sale often say applicable every room house think good way thinking meaning applicable every component business every budget ability u

organization world adopting dynamic solve problem think absolutely fair people thought market think actually even told people market think point market problem solved module best good customer u help q keith wei amy hood q keith wei amy hood got want shift gear platform side equation talking sort big growth driver model least azure market opportunity ahead azure jason zander evp azure talked market azure tam highest 4 trillion 1 trillion look specific massive number help u understand budget dollar come interesting think go back think satya talked relatively consistently every time thought market size excess usually bigger topic almost took every line item literally everyone like p l mean literally every po purchase order opened every process run inside company around world said run effectively eﬃciently answer likely yes tool likely technology ask somebody define big market answer big ask okay two business possible run distributed system data enabled ai business possible absolutely think see think people feel incredibly optimistic period time size market think anyone feel constrained market tam take constraint one talking customer azure know customer thinking term sort budget come traditionally seen said come server storage buying anymore expanded software stack buying database anymore coming azure imagine also extends telco networking human cost administration customer see way understand sort full value replacement come azure interesting would tell conversation start budget come trying dismissive budget love budget trust really take great pride budgeting customer conversation tend start like grow faster like win like better serve customer like improve customer state like reduce churn like grow price like retain margin mean cost way question raised much like problem solved problem solved hence take language q keith wei amy hoodthe implementation generally azure dynamic oﬃce 365 security bucket good problem tends start people say okay well get paid may point replacement dollar moving budget priority around may say gosh mean lower churn 0.5 point lot growth afford cost get room room system feel like know many conversation energy room sure land somewhere right ultimately much easier always say find money budget passion team around growth find money even hard sound like past four five year conversation microsoft assuming like contracting behind shifting technology provider strategic relationship forming company like albertson forward looking really drive change business structure contract structure relationship today different five year ago 10 year ago microsoft technology provider interesting keith want say yes reason say different maybe materially different always tried customer contracting reﬂect customer desire structure said know see sort rhythm exploration base get drone quarterly call reality contract especially oﬃce side part business oﬃce 365 business seeing think alluding maybe azure side business contract taking different ﬂare try make look like old answer tried really hard make look like right answer customer may actually talked may get big long contract know hear u talk remaining rpo longer year le year nature transition yeah got big one commitment made upfront maybe price reason maybe want work laid specific workload made contracting better tool maybe frankly really large customer prefer pega pay go right maybe preferred method okay remind people azure unique regard right mean got use show p l whether contracted sitting book sitting rpo really really count get deployed use loved add value revenue contracting language far important make sure getting workload deployed customer getting value far far two year three year five year seven year two week q keith wei amy hood q keith wei amy hood got got investor think azure growth equation evolving term workload growth mix sort workload growth much moving sort core service like infrastructure service platform service like database machine learning service top guess come back p q q equation still basis getting higher value service becoming bigger part mix increasing p yeah think go back tam assume market large generally feel gap q challenge right q instance consumption model literally growing usage workload adoption right workload picked expanding think tends constraint would think asking pricing margin actually tend bigger nuance right got q growth depend land order really gross margin look still feel good platform think would call core infra growth saying seen obviously good growth data platform layer increasingly would call premium service layer workload shifting right think q feel constrained people feel like left hand right hand right take workload exist shift like shift right seen today right new workload new thing frankly considered see shift spend shift plus new look quite different think see shift new combination data generally core platform overtime sometimes people ask one would bigger know answer expect q grow growth may look better data side smaller relative base given transition happen think one even getting education consumption model work right definitely different firm gone perpetual license subscription function think lot learning think think price performance right much price performance looking push end customer consistently see sort increasing value platform much sort price performance eﬃciencies garnered azure become better gross margin q keith wei amy hoodi trying think question start think number one competitive market price set market tend think hey wait eﬃciencies gained sit better way think consumption mark marketplace like way competitive market lot big player competing aggressively mean price move time new price new workload new capability whether higher differentiation tend margin others le separately believe competitive market spend lot time making sure fundamental terrific mean focus cost per unit work seen gross margin improvement team done great job frankly front continues great job front reason focus ultimately competitive market cost price right want make sure continue address fundamental great service great quality easy deployment low cost low cost deploy differentiation let leverage margin stay focused gross margin stay focused winning stay focused taking share stay focused fact large market think lot good tailwind well positioned sort give take margin side general focus think controllable right one last question commercial side want touch couple consumer corporate strategy question within server tool much durable grower lot people imagined hybrid cloud advantage great program microsoft unlocked lot sort would say latent demand cio sort customer getting locked one side equation come point customer take advantage hybrid cloud advantage start shifting azure versus premise start become headwind know would call happening headwind way always thought hybrid program really customer need customer need desire run workload effective place run workload want run frankly want run enablement ﬂexibility call hybrid program u really believe focus overall kpi even though everybody really want customer purchase want always saying like listen adopt ﬂexibility q keith wei amy hood q keith wei amy hoodif know want move workload know committed window committed stipple great ﬂexible option give customer absolute control overtime guess move azure would quote unquote heavy headwind revenue know world view headwind strategically customer continuing use product service best way work would likely show azure revenue would show revenue feel badly loose lot sleep reason see ﬂowing growth seeing faster shift azure view good thing got moving personal computing got got three minute left friend mean almost made p l going get shorten question even would say last two conference call tone satya pc surprisingly strong sort changing nature pc basis probably question get lot investor like saying talk u little bit positive tone pc think way bigger issue hearing positive turn pc frankly deliver made talking window absolutely role large screen device productivity ability job every day saw past two year proof true true utility device inability accurately explain may fact either issue people realizing wow figured window matter figured talk reality large screen device past couple year reminded role play pc household time spent pc continuing see even hybrid job done play great role many job done window 11 think great investment modern beautiful user experience window seeing good response people love window 10 great thrilled fact seeing holistic version window experience user q keith wei amy hoodthe difference world view made evident think many place evident strength microsoft 365 consumer subscription evident browser share grant game evident search number simplicity window work user meaningful positive experience make day better said know excel may brings joy thing bring people joy pc gaming terrific example window always place people game always bring back integrating user experience know find think way one whatever review form got year say forgot talk window long time going remedy seeing user seeing usage seeing market eight quarter demand never seen people talk supply constraint absolutely supply constraint system eight highest quarter pc demand seen ever shipment market stepping partner stepping demand supply even record shipment feel good optimistic optimistic window mean user continue make better integrated make easier thing like excel others maybe something else fun got want sneak one last question opex think people impressed ability trying fund growth within microsoft also continually find eﬃciencies within business grow operating margin still kind room eﬃciency side equation fund equation basis well mean 16 head count growth last quarter many way excited able spent know 40 minute talking optimism long period time revenue opportunity exist order capture ultimately need people need people excited work people want sell people want help customer deploy actually feel really good investment even also still believe spend dollar better mean team mean know always think reinventing moving dollar around asking every single day better move thing around make maybe right bet table move ask mean love mean like mean okay second excel love headcount budget ask asking every day better better customer better engineering team make process work differently q keith wei amy hood q keith weisschange customer acquisition cost move team would get something shift faster like know yeah nobody also hooked keith still find way eﬃcient still thing better yes still need grow thing happen still good operating leverage best thing top line growth mix everything else execute top make lot moving around far far easier day outstanding well amy unfortunately end allotted time slot thank much joining u fascinating conversation well keith thank sorry changed question little thanks everybody good see everybody thank
