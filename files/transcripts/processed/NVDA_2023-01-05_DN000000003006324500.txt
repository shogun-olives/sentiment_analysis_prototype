year spending focused strategic compute initiative like accelerated compute right colette kress harlan sur colette kressand combine hopper ramp h100 ramp continued strong enterprise adoption strong networking demand pool history would suggest team grow data center segment percentage growth rate year help u understand put take around data center business challenging year confidence driving growth fiscal yeah focus within company really get great product market hopper architecture bringing market feed many great thing ai market expanded exceptionally since last architecture advancement market whole complexity size model continued grow seeing three important area ai probably infancy exist last three year area large language model fueled natural language processing recommended system yet another one still important monetization monetization marketing key area last one think probably seen holiday focus generative ai really great opportunity creating model creating trained model seen possible produced generative ai excited also focused key area end moore law accelerated computing need right position architecture improve performance nearly 5x last generation also energy eﬃciency concept end moore law really built sustainability going data center going forward focusing eﬃciency right thing market continues grow hopper full lineup expect grace cpu help inﬂuence connectivity working gpu really working term speed work term datacenter able control macroenvironment great lineup product help fuel growth good start ph team started shipping hopper production initial shipment q

market bring production level h100 market quarter started initial one q3 starting q4 yes expect ramp fiscal year first quarter well continue ramp h100 big undertaking fabulous product relationship work really come know talk lot user power user accelerated compute right one thing anxiously awaiting cpu gpu architect see cpu gpu architecture called cache coherency basically thought process memory sharing like eﬃcient memory sharing cpu gpu currently available think intel amd think two year away cxl initiative grace cpu expected sample believe year guy already cache coherency grace cpu give u sense like said team expected sample year ramp market year first team tracking timeline grace think revenue profile opportunity grace sure let talk grace overall goal think work done ai work data center ca ever accomplish one gpu spending year focusing linking together multiple gpus essentially coming supercomputer supercomputer help size model well eﬃciencies speed work accomplishing done interconnects came together mellanox well working another important piece brought grace grace give u opportunity focus speed cpu gpus also focusing mentioned term memory make sure eﬃcient process grace cpu focused large model large model focusing ai focusing supercomputing focusing computing workload many new thing see future digital twin amount work take account grace hopper go together yes track sampling bring market year area working many customer see connectivity putting two product together great opportunity continue work colette kress harlan surlet shift focus gaming despite challenging consumer market demand new ada 40 series gaming product initial one 4090 4080 seems quite good check online retail site 4090 tight availability place 4080 gpu card pricing marked 10 15 relative msrp suggests really good demand mentioned special address jeff mentioned special address 40 adopted rtx gpus rtx architecture new product launch think additional penetration rate typically
