okay good afternoon everyone welcome mark murphy software analyst jp morgan great pleasure dave evp cfo commercial division microsoft dave first welcome thank much taking time thank mark happy anytime anybody offer trip boston yes know recently ran boston marathon one crazier thing done yes question answer question answer great back maybe could brieﬂy introduce describe team product oversee within role maybe size business u q mark murphy dave q mark murphy dave cfo commercial business sometimes people ask commercial business microsoft say everything consumer sort easiest way define name everyone familiar oﬃce window azure sql biz apps commercial perspective give take sort 150 billion year okay around 150 billion let begin topic generative ai pilot since last year outspoken bull topic bull microsoft leadership within category generative ai actually referred openai investment potentially best money ever spent noticed amy satya saying committed leading ai platform wave company 22 year interested would describe level internal excitement magnitude opportunity microsoft try go lead ai era sure certainly hot topic customer partner investor think urgency passion around topic high lot people come ask u think ai even sure asking yet want know going world going company customer talking company need get front would say high sense excitement customer partner high sense urgency inside microsoft bit expanding circle first made investment 2019 relatively small group people involved permeates everything microsoft everything working big focus u big focus customer think really early really really good sign interest demand impressed topic dave product known github copilot started noticing 18 month ago would speak developer would say well wrote code day long 40 50 code generated github copilot math pretty staggering think bottleneck term enough developer world soon going copilot security going dynamic going team word excel powerpoint told preview product going blow people mind people private preview think going see greatest ai value creation among product yes mean blow mind always interpretive thing think impressive watching developed q mark murphy dave q mark murphyamazing thing speed developed started openai logical place start reason make sense oﬃce team got building copilot product quickly came together quickly surface product much direct value add impressive think certainly expectation exceeded expectation think ability tap openai benefit brings make usable drive productivity increase impressive speed move think everything accelerating goal company stay leader stay leader need keep moving really really quickly think would see urgency everything everything build think term see value think lot value something like bing search engine really lot value something like oﬃce window modern work product see big productivity increase definitely see speed impressed everyone also wondering microsoft planning monetize know mentioned talk microsoft 365 copilot monetization coming month generally speaking think pricing packaging ai kind stack sure general level really way think one many product sold basis work instance certain functionality people use day every day company would prefer pay product data example maybe construct make sense maybe consumption model make sense others might point ai service people go use pay go use disappear come back month later use think opportunity u company see show place consumption show others others service demand okay pretty broad range question tend get frequently investor upfront investment profile going look like first train large language model right going bear cost actually operating embed product dave q mark murphy dave q mark murphy dave think margin impact microsoft make investment yes good question think important folk remember successful building large language model operate large language model need lot data center capacity need footprint know say hyperscaler help hyperscaler already footprint matter making sure machine capacity available inferencing training obviously incremental cost cheap come right monetization model think important thing cloud business build data center footprint first took long time super expensive adding capacity data center allows u serve llms.so think think mean margin opportunity probably come little quicker would otherwise cloud model come quicker probably little quicker already data center footprint taking advantage exists okay encouraging hear dave moment ago mentioned great speed microsoft moving direction think weighing benefit first market moving quickly chatgpt copilot opportunity gain leadership position also risk moving quickly putting thing wild could risk around bias could risk around hallucination try protect customer proprietary data well right think weighing yes mean obviously important question mark thought leader since beginning unresponsible ai think managing ai mean sam altman gone record several time saying hey need regulated come regulate u think everybody going open mind need make sure guardrail think growing business regard hallucination et cetera aware want eliminate degree possible focused responsible ai perspective making sure managing people data making q mark murphy dave q mark murphy dave abiding privacy regulation making sure thing compliantly super important focus year one thing seems like popped overnight started investing back 2019 think came responsible ai principle year ago trying drive thought leadership responsible way keep satya recently discussed belief ai going reshape pretty much every single software category work came across comment saying would next big battleground maybe help u look future think existing product announced think going see largest growth opportunity even beyond going evaluate future opportunity building ai product well think first sort answer reverse order first area go customer see value work spend lot time part commercial business talking directly customer partner get sense really matter go build area really matter also think company perspective one first thing look total addressable market say big could market get permission play like make sense u really big market think deliver customer value going go think term think immediate ability monetize go back think work productivity tool oﬃce modern work broadly think going immediate value also think sort add lot talk ai going eliminate job think automate lot function free time worker go thing even within finance team automate function free time finance team go work customer directly help understand honestly would rather finance team working customer manual reporting something back end think productivity gain free people go work thing point github shortage developer think expands capacity build better product lot goodness come yes yes especially oﬃce potential get front could dream dream putting front 1 billion people pretty rapidly right q mark murphy dave q mark murphy dave q mark murphyyes bit hard impress day oﬃce team came demo like hey good stuff happened fast really right let shift gear talk bit getting azure talk trend seen around optimization frame way last microsoft partner survey asking long expect see elevated level cloud optimization activity continue came back said average something like four five quarter basically saying customer trying le right environment time frame strike bit pessimistic already chunk customer kind done optimization right would nearing end yes think natural say four quarter sort optimization start lap think optimization perspective first see optimization good thing never customer come say need cut budget like hey would like kind running budget way optimize spend generally right optimization growth opportunity even cause little bit compression see optimization good thing think going reprioritize keep spending budget cloud going new area cloud think say year start lap think customer basis true customer optimizing faster others always going okay compression also kind set table growth opportunity later compression expansion time expansion part amy comment recent earnings call ai service would contribute one point azure growth current quarter june quarter course run math equates something like 500 million run rate people pointed u number azure openai customer increased 10x sequentially last quarter combining extrapolate bit logical conclude ai service going become pretty meaningful boost azure growth looking let say 12 24 month word could actually contributing 2 3 4 5 point growth truly moving needle azure dave q mark murphy dave q mark murphy dave q mark murphyyes would say mark mean early day cloud talked hey maybe market could 10 billion 20 billion obviously far exceeded given trying predict going go would say couple thing seem make sense one cloud still lot growth left think continue see good solid growth cloud business two ai pretty new nascent would make sense ai grow faster cloud business think mean almost work parallel without getting number think going big growth opportunity u think given size azure business growth ai think make sense say ai meaningful part number point okay one question relates directly azure started hear fieldwork company going fundamentally begin evaluate across hyperscaler platform really increasingly based generative ai capability given microsoft strong early leadership arena see type halo effect developing maybe start see azure actually gaining share workload world may company saying well let start moving data azure right ready time come use ai capability certainly get interest customer mark get customer maybe talking call say hey would love talk ai give u opportunity open door azure since best ai service run best azure think start conversation started right would say reﬂected conversation customer conversation people necessarily cloud customer azure customer talking manifest term share time tell think big door opener u promising trend good trend yes okay let switch gear bit talk oﬃce estimate approaching 50 billion revenue massive business even 150 billion responsible o365 commercial bulk dave q mark murphy dave q mark murphy dave q mark murphywhen drill recently grew 18 constant currency view key ingredient broader phenomenon driving scale business level durable growth azure talking azure growth sorry talking meant say oﬃce okay oﬃce yes oﬃce business mentioned one earlier meeting remember sitting meeting long time ago oﬃce 10 billion business person running said know keep growing 10 billion 10 billion ago think done really good job continuing deliver lot value think seen increased functionality oﬃce people appreciate willing pay primarily historically come one three way one seat growth lot seat growth small medium business space important space small medium business become big business seen lot good seed growth seen really good arpu growth especially recently e5 sku security high demand around telephony analytics piece people willing pay u get additional functionality seen seat growth seen arpu growth seen u break new market think continued add value go long convince customer spending money productivity tool save money elsewhere p l think continue successful onus u make pitch make convincingly show clearly going save bunch money think continue spend u think growth opportunity good runway growth opportunity move forward want try drill hinting algorithm right growth algorithm oﬃce side drilled 18 growth oﬃce 365 seat grew 11 arpu would driven something like six seven point top mentioned arpu driver right e5 dave q mark murphy dave q mark murphya big one pricing change maybe going copilot uplift future learn pricing see growth algorithm evolving oﬃce 365 think wondering going get point arpu driving little equation going forward think depends value adding think new functionality going come within copilot think probably biggest value added long time would go far say yes arpu going make bigger chunk could see somebody could reach conclusion based functionality going ship think see good balance seat growth arpu growth based new functionality bringing okay let move ask moment security look microsoft partner survey run quarterly cadence security actually usually ranking number one product microsoft product term momentum partner actually reﬂecting u high level inbound interest security side learned recently passed 20 billion revenue grew 33 think secret microsoft think scale growth trajectory look around world many company want say want consolidate security provider far ambition reach think differentiating microsoft security stack well think right security perspective growing business always new threat new place people spend money security product really want protect enterprise see market grow honestly forever think security threat ever go away think hacker trying new thing every day think important u stay ahead product perspective think thing cover breadth enterprise point solution competitor provide point solution really good job really good job area think breadth solution cover enterprise value prop think offer product way want part product get want breadth security offering get think ﬂexibility add lot value think market maybe others continue see growth long threat world think security growing market maybe others dave q mark murphy dave q mark murphy dave q mark murphymaybe never know mean like said given predicting yes hard predict future even happened yet yes say okay want come back github sort pointing think microsoft shrewd acquisition made year pretty good example comment recently github home 100 million developer exceeded 1 billion arr scale think back five year estimate time 30 million 35 million developer world bridge gap github expand market point 100 million developer yes would remember day talking 3 million developer 5 million developer 10 million 30 million think part happened redefined developer used somebody known sort hardcore coder wrote software think github sort democratized mean developer product easy use much ﬂexibility thing would say sort adjacent power apps strategy seen good traction power apps easy use easy build app people previously considered developer think see developer helped expand category developer sector financial service great example decided need financial service company need tech company grown footprint developer noted beginning shortage developer degree copilot expand productivity single developer think goodness going run going always demand developer least foreseeable future anything increase productivity going help think github got forefront thing sort middle seems like showed working github copilot several year feel like sort manifesting dave q mark murphy dave hearing 18 month ago sure making difference sure developing okay think said moment ago security may kind durable growth perhaps else team product recently surpassed 300 million monthly active still showing strength even pandemic continuing invest feature coming pretty quickly team team phone team room team premium think evolution team product durability growth especially hybrid type world yes think think good durable growth mean essentially look communication anything go along communication opportunity team started wanted sort product people could use talk big consumer opportunity lot opportunity expand functionality within business talk team room meeting still lot done think good durable growth also think product getting functional better every day lot customer probably even exposed yet lot good growth left think team product hear lot good comment customer functionality lot room grow power platform mention power platform moment ago context github discussion product addition security team power platform power apps category always ranking top three four term microsoft product momentum run partner survey think back dave probably 20 year ago software company saying going create product going create citizen developer never really believed right never really saw anything going break feel like one help u understand microsoft crack code ability get nontechnical user get hump right get creating app people like u room yes think thing came together well one apps small apps easier build say big app like crm one prevalence introduction apps smaller functional pointed two focus lot really get people felt comfortable using felt like applicable three get pricing packaging right worked hard q mark murphy dave sort three come together like still writing big long software package power apps would applicability micro apps make applicable made easy use think priced right saw customer start give 6 10 20 user pretty quickly like would cost license everybody company went viral sort pretty good rate would know maybe probably faster expected think three thing come together else probably would taken much dave ca thank enough taking time u today mean world u incredibly helpful hear great success thanks
