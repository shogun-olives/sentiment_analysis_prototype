right thanks crowd making end day appreciate chris nvidia coming ir side talk u story presentation today going go straight q extent question said 17 time today please wait mike coming webcast hear one way starting little specific guy analog guy et cetera starting asking question current business condition generally seeing compare contrast might help frame know ca really change guidance last couple year back half year generally disappointing company business gotten bit choppy could talk seasonal perspective either way seeing current business condition versus seen year past second half number business try take segment look geforce business consumer graphic business two different dynamic operate market desktop side business chieï¬‚y gaming business seems going use word immune probably strong word right seems still growing strongly immune pc malaise going say continues grow strongly asp growing market continuing well pc gamers still want play game side business oem business largely notebook graphic weak like rest pc notebook market weak course consumer exposed consumer side ross seymore chris evendenlook number pc market surprise consumer worse commercial obviously feeling like anybody else netting year year approximately ï¬‚at course profit going gaming business much profitable netbook oem business moving quadro workstation business currently looking pretty strong two consecutive quarter strong growth 80 revenue business driven manufacturing cad biggest application area quadro manufacturing data look pretty good pmi data look good took uptick last month everyone know car manufacturing data fantastically good recently reason continued optimism reason focus market 90 dollar share market bunch promising initiative try grow market dominant term equation like market pretty well business small growth business bigger market ca give extra market insight result really share gain story like tesla tesla extremely well talk later small part massive computing market necessarily relevant perspective ditto tegra well tegra relatively small part mobile computing market well start diving main segment gpu side obviously bread butter company stick consumer side first leave used call professional service business psb gpu side thing talk little bit strategy guy done incredibly good job otherwise challenging pc environment making margin rise revenue side equation relatively strong well talk little bit able deliver part share gain competitive product mean kepler architecture current generation gpu architecture genuinely good architecture better chip think fixed problem back track 65 market share feel like good level part innate strength gaming market referred earlier genuinely strong genuinely independent apparently independent aï¬ „ ictions affecting rest pc market notebook market like said ross seymore chris evenden ross seymoreso pc market pc gaming market diï¬ƒcult one measure diï¬ƒcult find good data believe growing 10 annually based software sale software sale actually diï¬ƒcult measure something like 80 pc gaming revenue go online online 20 packaged software sale ca take best buy gauge health pc gaming market give misleading picture health gaming market 80 online revenue downloads game online version buying software increasingly large part subscription game purchase sort thing new model generating life software frankly chinese software situation forced game developer find new way generating revenue people buying software china innovation caught see mean frankly see phone platform well people used paying 0.99 game getting game free mean get grand theft auto shield android gaming device 4.99 full version grand theft auto different model driving lot success pc gaming diï¬ƒcult count end day 10 year seems right number talk notebook side ultimate consumer side going market anything specific nvidia core pc gaming side close level started stabilizing notebook side core gaming left revenue guy good question hard say think lot weakness notebook side driven fact tablet better solution consumer pc using pc general computing task like surfing web updating facebook reading writing email tablet much better solution vast majority people much convenient instant always connected portable pc last laptop took 10 minute boot pc user migrating tablet however like said gamers pc specific purpose specialized purpose like designer workstation specific purpose researcher tesla workstation specific purpose like destination mind rather something need frankly people email surf web facebook function adult 21st century think one background thing done chris evenden ross seymore chris evenden ross seymore chris evendenkind scary well apparently adult learned child old people facebook instagram actually way go tablet already cool anymore yes get gaming side equation stick even desktop side thing impact think new console refresh whole process get console question playing much generation funny little data went back look data people company adhere strongly completely opposite point view console refresh affect company went back looked data really data affect inaudible diï¬ƒcult tell pas data affect downside obviously pc gamers typically 1.x console gamers money buy new console presumably come wallet used buy pc game pc gaming hardware however pc gamers spend 1,000 5,000 pc fairly well compared typical gamer might mitigate argument actually since new console close pc actually like gaming system within band gaming pc whereas far diï¬ƒcult port software across much work generate asset specifically pc gamers much higher quality gaming experience got sort pc gaming experience console argument go developer would developed console game find much easier port game across pc likely see greater amount content pc would drive pc gaming sale ross seymore chris evenden ross seymore chris evenden ross seymoreso argue way honestly know going turn console generation going interesting one market changed alluded earlier people spent last seven year learning buy software free 0.99 increment idea spending 560 xbox one another 60 copy halo even start playing anathema large proportion modern gamers see mean read look satisfactory interested see early adopter whether stop whether continue evolve beyond yes hard figure much complementary much substitution effect even bull bear company prospect could argue 0.99 game good thing company sell graphic general talked predominant portfolio yes 0.99 typically source income game like one colleague recently bought game game think paid 2.99 android marketplace subsequently spent 40 buying car bought sucker yes bought game still racing prius got porsche wo take point way mean extracting value customer people pay 2.99 game decide rubbish never come back people pay 2.99 game decide actually quite like would really like next car spend 5 say oh really want car oh car part bundle spend 15 instead getting car want get car sort would like well know 40 lighter trouble connection spent lot money quickly without even feeling point funding game even 0.99 entry level chris evenden ross seymore chris evenden ross seymore chris evenden ross seymoreright yes arguing funding side taking opposite side many people would said leave tegra device like play game like said shield device 0.99 play grand theft auto oh see saying would compete pc game killed pc game clearly pc game market actually done quite well similar analogy think inaudible two different type gamer right 0.99 game casual game starting get decent game sort price different sort experience opposed experience people used talk pc gamers fiercely loyal pc gaming interface hear rather die conceding best interface ever developed playing game loyal mentioned earlier buy gaming platform well pc gamers gamers pc favorite platform probably one invest ipads latest android phone well sure much cannibalization get see people moving back original part topic get back game console side guy played role ip side thing actual silicon prior generation time gone amd side equation happen focus much think really good question ask console manufacturer reason console game industry danger participating console industry cause lose focus core market lot reason would want participate lot reason company would choose u amd would want speculate chris evenden ross seymore chris evendenwas architectural change looking like pc integrating amd call apu putting cpu together gpu single die something guy gpu side x86 true x86 tegra really question microsoft sony want specifically x86 part story switch talked gaining share part driver going back 65 level kepler involved view dynamic going forward steady state kind limited market grows think maybe competition focusing game console side share could find think take step back look market feel pretty stable level zoom close obviously fighting tooth nail every single design win fighting aggressively every oem fighting aggressively channel working hard see win win win win awful lot backwards forward equilibrium dynamic equilibrium zoom think sometimes people try zoom much try conversation one oem oem think conversation try hard make sure mistaking wood tree try stay focused big picture step back think 65/35 seems like good level know amd worked hard aggressively software bundling promotion hard imagine effect share certainly ever feel position ever adjust price despite fact giving away 240 software graphic card extremely expensive promotion run even though paying 60 probably paying significant amount given cost gpu system got new product coming couple month feel got pretty good bead would counter course point new product back forth back forth fight fight fight end day probably stable ross seymore chris evenden ross seymore chris evenden ross seymore chris evendenthere ups down view think probably fairly stable share view without asking preannounce anything course think response kepler come subsequent architecture kepler come roughly speaking middle next year early next year well think response come next week understanding see put whether significant advance current architecture proprietary lineup wo talk product try going announce announce yes right right bit ancillary discussion pertinent long ago shrinking side equation small die challenge getting access reasonable price argument partnership versus customer relationship foundry et cetera important chasing moore law fight appears cost chasing moore law think important realize architecture trump process every time obviously smaller process node generally better larger process node architecture much significant impact performance fact software put architecture much significant impact performance point numerous example past art ati ahead process node behind performance see throughout history company competition said moving new process node valuable add transistor find new way differentiate add value consumer long find way make consumer experience noticeably better moving smaller node good thing keep meanwhile ross seymore chris evenden ross seymore chris evendenwe innovate process node well improve architecture come completely new architecture carry tuning existing architecture make eï¬ƒcient either compact performance work dimension good thing moving fast one process node next mean chip often would want move node point point want move new node introduce new step function graphic functionality feature slowing movement node node could actually good thing u enables u reduce node transition cost would imagine guinea pig node longer another benefit well let ashcrofts guy would think almost certainly product advanced node available question quickly transition quite pressure advantage term cost performance stark past pressure move rapidly make choice product move last question traditional graphic side thing integration guy used play chipset side got pulled cpu apu amd call integration graphic capability chipset actual cpu always big concern yet last couple year guy grown rather nicely whether market share gain pricing see dynamic threat integration low end impacting business interesting thing going back way described geforce market gaming pc market equates approximately desktop oem market equates approximately notebook quite perfect correlation oem desktop gaming notebook first order approximation pretty good gamers buy gaming pc playing game something part part oems buy graphic graphic performance want discrete graphic differentiate laptop exactly oem survive selling laptop want sell 500 laptop 600 laptop justify increase cost part intel brand i3 i5 i7 part integrated discrete consumer buying laptop consumer talked looking utilitarian notebook buying using price proxy quality getting graphic accident strong term almost incidentally part buying pc get real benefit course buying graphic performance guy looking 3dmark vantage score 600 notebook like walk liquor store buy bottle wine people course benchmarking guide parker benchmarking guide wine many people know walk shelf going `` well 40 bottle wine score 80 parker one 45 bottle wine score 92 parker term point per dollar much better bottle wine think buy one people like analogous pc gamers pc gamers buy benchmark absolutely u buy wine based price proxy quality drinking alone might buy 15 bottle wine trying impress girlfriend parent meeting first time might buy 40 bottle wine gave metaphor jensen way laughed think cook 40 bottle wine important point well reason spend certain amount pc important technology much money u might buy 700 laptop love technology others u might realize actually 400 going meet need well fine like people buy expensive car cheap car toyota camry basic function car toyota camry good bmw car still u like idea owning bmw even twice price long rambling story end day say people buying laptop buying performance intel getting better graphic performance displace discrete graphic thing could displace discrete graphic like bomb cost pressure touch screen perhaps one thing might displace discrete graphic graphic performance one thing debate 10 year remember first started graphic industry well 10 year ago debate journalist way back intel launching think 945g chipset much better graphic different time ross seymore chris evendenfor discrete graphic recurring debate reason never happens buying graphic performance right well let switch gear tegra side smaller part business probably larger frequency question get recent quarter july quarter end guy tough quarter know reason guided significantly next quarter thing ramping nicely still two quarter 50 70 roughly year year talk little bit transition away tegra 3 tegra 4 guess question really come win game even merchant perspective seem getting best margin coming side bunch question let win year tegra 4 late obviously meant disadvantaged competing big tablet important tablet competing tegra 3 reason lateness sometimes product late deliberate sense decided wanted double tegra 4 tegra 5 made sure going miss deadline amazon google tegra 4 least tegra 5 would schedule least tegra 4i bring accelerate market tegra 4i integrated product mainstream smartphone product seen sampling tegra 4i since february started sampling project logan presumably become tegra 5 fullness time actually demo early july sampling since august good schedule right place compete amazon google tablet company focused bringing tegra 4i market bringing tegra 5 revenue quickly possible know software team focused hardware team focused sale team focused yes mean certainly first half year diï¬ƒcult revenue standpoint diï¬ƒcult choice right thing put u right place future year mean could doubled tegra 4 probably still late win thing perhaps tegra 5 would pushed late win next year really trouble behind playing forever way actually really good product available right time compete win ross seymore chris evenden ross seymore guess second part question let assume tegra 5 hit market time google amazon refresh et cetera market standalone apps processor big enough warrant investment oh yes yes look android android ubiquitous android everywhere going see everywhere manner device phone tablet going see car going see tv going see box probably whole bunch category thought yet many application visual computing important heart visual computing company value bring customer product differentiation consumer see wherever android intersects visual computing tegra succeed phone tablet device mentioned large market large fact succeed phone tegra still success emphasize wholly committed succeeding phone got great chip tegra 4i succeed well look talked state merchant market application process said attractive market pc market look like attractive market either yet pc business pc gaming business extremely attractive 10 year growth gross margin highly profitable highly defensible well put lot software around actually term driver also lot work done ecosystem hundred engineer function work developer get latest feature feature game defensible market let see replicate mobile computing market well win specific segment segment unique skill experience one would likely defensible grow long term well going competitor across whole phone tablet market would seem suicide right find defensible segment unique advantage intersection visual computing android specifically make gaming matter think good place u point certainly big enough profitably fund development tegra going long way let open question audience unidentified participant chris evenden unidentified participant chris evendenhi one thing curious diï¬ƒculties market general integrating communication lte particular processor mobile space something managed certainly qualcomm done seems something lot harder think lot people feeling would want understand really hard whether give sustainable advantage given really one competitor think pretty good position right 3g voice data modem shipping couple year 4g data modem shipping year 4g voice data modem currently well way qualification 4g data modem likely qualification next month think probably pretty good position lot claim counterclaim company diï¬ƒcult know exactly everyone feel like right front pack least think five year none matter 4g important part buying decision wifi manufacturer today connectivity important today one company focusing everyone mind think advantage u fact even importantly advantage u cease headwind think operate high end market solely high end mobile computing market operate market without access lte modem tough proposition lte becomes essential phone fact success think good progress u question question talk integration chip know want go great detail technical challenge think issue much integration lte complex lot people would happen believe saw recently broadcom bought beceem beceem wimax company wimax lot feature common lte lte bigger step wimax lte think anticipating hence last week acquisition renesas ross seymore chris evendenbut integration think particular hurdle think actually building lte modem computationally intensive task complex term particularly handling voice call handheld lot work need done look integration took u u acquiring icera actually sampling chip integrated lte modem 20 month feel pretty good think testament skill engineer involved like said think big obviously technical challenge integrating product like think big technical challenge lte modem question audience 2 minute left little bit different question strategic question nature shield getting hardware side bit chatter earlier week potentially tablet tablet talk little bit thought process behind getting hardware one side confirmed maybe even one way rumor never comment rumor try quick since rambling far shield side couple thing shield want sell lot want make money selling also way shield succeeds u helping u build fortress gaming inside mobile computing space bridge like strength pc gaming strength hope mobile gaming great device build generally pretty conservative company capability genuinely think company know much gaming hardware software got experience mobile pc console market hundred people spend entire life working directly game developer got 20 year 20 year experience market huge brand gamers 70 million geforce user today know brand awareness brand preference particularly country like china huge 90 market share china example big big brand equity leverage launch product succeed think anyone likely make product succeed niche product going sell ten million unit year think going offend existing customer base see specific niche understand communicated ross seymore chris evenden operatorcarefully launch explain work yes think right people build product great ask question afterwards time end day thank making end day chris thank bringing u home strong fashion thank question answer question
