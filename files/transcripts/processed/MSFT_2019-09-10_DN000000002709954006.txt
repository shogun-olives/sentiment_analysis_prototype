okay good morning everybody thanks attending db annual tech conference great seeing lot people know well thanks coming hope guy fantastic two day one highlight think got pretty amazing keynote start jason zander head evp microsoft head azure pretty special keynote addition jason got ceo vmware got head salesforce service cloud fantastic let start microsoft maybe jason want give quick minute history microsoft think firm couple year right couple yeah thank pleased jason zander evp azure run product work got obviously azure think familiar public cloud offering build course worldwide support product oﬃce 365 xbox live et cetera course make available customer great growth actually microsoft since 1992 joined still selling do 4 window 3 new remember little team along way one engineer created .net framework ran ﬂagship visual studio developer tool product stuff like moved azure team 2012 go work satya nadella evp division time point team everything datacenters software involved plus silicon way crazy stuff like quantum computing kind dream job system engineer middle big inﬂection point lot fun karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zander know ca comment size azure put 13 billion disclose growth rate 68 constant currency seriously almost unheard business scale growing 68 must funnest job huge fun mentioned 68 growth constant currency really exciting mean fun thing course working lot company digital transformation industry shifting speak looking trusted tech provider awesome opportunity build technology base trusted partner innovation agenda really cool stuff industry significant amount fun yeah well fun watching progress think everybody audience theme probably four year feel like azure starting get sea leg 2015 aws first amazon first reported aws number kind shock street start paying attention theme think span four year everybody monitoring pretty carefully degree visibility sort underlying trend maybe start asking look last boy six month couple shift occurring change occurring cloud infrastructure market significant ﬂag group today yeah think definitely continue benefit spending definitely continuing see company want accomplish two thing really one become much agile delivery business important especially entire industry start shift expectation change course tighter budget well need save money obviously value cloud kind hyperscale capability got allows run workload run far cheaper benefit actually start cloud task otherwise paying personnel actually free budget apply towards innovation agenda definitely benefiting continued growth come karl keirstead jason zanderi think also seeing u land quite number large kind mega deal seen u announcement fortune top fortune 50 company looking microsoft trusted partner able carry forward innovation agenda well thing driving obviously lot growth seeing worldwide basis satya said think response question recent call big deal subject chunky deal got sort line sight think one microsoft talked public think chevron walmart walgreens couple big one want address feel like big change last six month nine month seeing 50 million 100 million deal drop seeing like 0.5 billion 1 billion drop know unique catalyst big deal starting happen clear shift last quarter two absolutely think starting see u deployed type technology increasingly tier 1 workload thing core business obviously significant amount work come like back oﬃce know work like well look kind tier 1 workload run business generally see large deal seeing u also integrate supply technology partner deeply mentioned great walmart chevron great example case look technology bringing bear like said would traditionally done would operating system like window server sql server exchange thing like running back oﬃce course actually exciting growth area well start seeing much larger deal seeing strategic integration technology capability skill set going along partner space well put two thing together super important think look transition lot industry interesting hiring software engineer continued grow rapidly isps like u automotive company fin sector basically healthcare folk hiring engineer technology becomes core part business think need kind structural advantage cloud edge frankly case might karl keirstead jason zanderactually wind competing cloud vendor case hyperscale cloud vendor like u partner necessity yeah jason talked little bit big deal beginning trend hosting tier 1 workload notion workload type azure hard one u outside see sit customer ask kind workload running azure aggregate picture tough get maybe ask little bit color way maybe sort traditional raw computer workload versus let say premium portion azure might migration existing legacy workload versus net new cut give u help u figure kind workload running azure today yes look customer journey around interesting thing company think one best one early jet.com course acquired walmart eventually also became partner u startup go straight however look bulk business highly focused around lot work enterprise circumstance mention got existing workload running datacenters leased datacenters long time want better position capex want agility associated frequent start level migration take existing workload get cloud get eﬃciency run cheaply get agility move innovation actually think chevron top fortune 50 company fantastic partner company started way essentially kind enterprise control plane software agility engineer could move quicker start workload sudden three became hundred hockey stick kicked got started innovation point iot upstream oil gas expiration looking seismic thing well moving beyond kind like sap portfolio bunch thing first round kind innovation side awesome journey cool thing actually together along way team company came along ride karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead yeah jason sure happens talked large fortune 100 customer pick anecdote friction attempting migrate existing workload azure aws google cloud comment migration pace feel like happening fast expected slower friction point kind thing microsoft extent customer quote stuck get unstuck right another one oftentimes really depend upon company mean example leveraging partner example si motion got partner work training partner year really know make workload go get migration done quickly know run mode actually move quickly finding lot company using move inﬂection point case want little bit clean maybe portfolio made bunch activity maybe waiting figure work actually factoring process really migration around actually get right kind trajectory one actually interesting case chevron lot company also want work skilling personnel like could come partner microsoft help move stuff quickly personnel yet come speed cloud operates ca take full advantage case actually want work along way become know move fast actually move quickly think seeing lot company usually one kind playbook speed vary always technology friction thing around around goal firm trying people trying overall portfolio tell start opening gate stuff man hockey stick ﬂoodgates open first workload go got people trained know sudden kind like rest stuff running see usage start spike jason zander karl keirsteadso maybe little bit migration pace everybody affecting talk certainly yesterday last week worried thing like slowing economic growth recession et cetera azure never period slow economic growth really started scale recently material business back hard u outside judge azure would one hand source cost saving agility would think company entering tougher economic time could accelerate hand extent cost associated workload could hold company back hard pontificate case study azure going maybe helpful maybe industry company azure serf stumbled curious reaction term migration activity story tell might help u question well one thing would look course point every industry cycle always around macro kind recession sort environment downturn particular area take oil gas take sort segment industry hit oftentimes really come back cost saving thing looking oftentimes starting evaluate capex starting figure gosh really need like renew lease coming really want go expensive want want actually reposition u go save money able change balance sheet get laid thing occur actually important really come partnership like role partner ecosystem role able help make sure someone realize end day going agile going save money run rate seen large company actually quite interested still making move really bad spot otherwise actually help course also service decade oﬃce 365 originally back first version bpos way back like 15 year ago actually run service kind business model actually quite true thing microsoft guess accelerate migration activity term partnership vendor vendor important part stack extent firm sort wedded vmware technology signed partnership vmware make easier port introduced azure stack create similar environment premise jason zander karl keirsteadwhat kind thing microsoft like accelerate growth suppose also making easier potentially cheaper migrate existing sql server window server workload azure probably important one want highlight couple thing yes absolutely mention bunch good one let split two apart make sure frame correctly think pat might next guest partnering well let take vmware first okay come back others particular case goal vmware hybrid operating environment u vmware also first class migration example like take vmware migrate instance goal goal instead partner vmware say hey existing stay got people personnel asset trained vmware let go partner together benefit mutual customer greater u time vmware solution huge kind response got amazing mean use benefit vmware access technology relationship vmware well azure get better together kind solution ca enable hybrid solution case really people wanting migrate workload sap fantastic one got amazing relationship sap really great momentum mean done really really well logged onto sapphire showing cool thing lot case study bunch others like fortune 50 example software may running premise able run seen people get 100 roi able reduce cycle time 40 mean like cloud lends incredibly well case migrating workload fully make ton sense hybrid scenario integrate together version 2008 cycle one interesting thing everybody aware went go large enterprise facing decision whether upgrade sql server database window server instance either keep upgrade latest version maybe spirit question catalyst actually get thinking azure instead version upgrade talk little bit seeing kind upgrade decision sort know probably ca give u exact number portion result customer saying let go azure jason zander karl keirstead yeah huge interest point end service 2008 r2 first thing would tell actually sql server window server actually part team part product portfolio got guess run azure cloud top technology best place run microsoft azure awesome place go going consider cloud make lot sense decision making perspective couple different thing one know need make move right end service need upgrade workload question often get like get point every couple year move far ahead going coming back upgrade apply personnel order actually work get better state cool thing way set hybrid benefit first moving azure five time cheaper actually running two workload window server sql server top aws much financially viable able licensing great repurchase get kind ﬂexibility hybrid use benefit time also move evergreen state basically say hey difference cloud managed instance actually keep date latest version database way lot thing hire people like backup maintenance stuff like service cloud going get cheaper economics cloud move going get eﬃcient system keep evergreen state sudden worry take saving get never seen department work punt push backlog apply resource onto actually move forward benefit playing hard right think microsoft fact ip built cloud around top awesome place go financially viable think actually great run rate maintenance perspective team mean appealing okay talk little bit competitive environment jason jason zander karl keirstead jason zander certainly imagine imagine rare big chevron walmart deal many sole sourced probably aws google table anything keeping honest talk little bit seeing around competitive environment versus amazon google seem swinging way yeah go back look growth 68 growth constant currency basically constant currency q4 big deal seeing growth get competitive environment two different dimension one one product work excellent differentiation hybrid work talked work done edge azure iot awesome example 6 trillion message day iot 70 industrial customer amazing data analytics got spark one first party azure database solution guy invented spark kind tech thing get azure mean product differentiation look broadly able one thing decade worth dna especially enterprise go run business probably already one customer mean help journey way quite likely using oﬃce 365 well probably identity system active directory mean nice network effect system line even better even outside azure broader microsoft cloud o365 dynamic 365 thing help propel one last thing competitive environment lot case also seeing lot interest business weird would one hand go pay vendor go help cloud hand would turn around compete generating lot question talk multiple people table case like might talking multiple people one going right going case would go pump money weird boardroom conversation yeah spent hundred million dollar vendor yeah number one competitor going forward like going case kind opportunity u come trusted vendor probably working karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zanderprobably 20 year technology investment spent capex want point able compete another stack investment going need asset mean partner deeply vertical focus think net favorable microsoft word probably going relatively well retail environment well retail environment obvious reason hand multiple speaker lot tech company rival microsoft might favor aws think net favorable microsoft sound think net perspective yes especially start seeing appetite cloud company start expand industry right mention one obvious others kind like point start calculus asking end competing maybe year maybe five year kind amazing see look like need someone actually help think come seeing great momentum one example okay sure chunky deal degree price competition severe one thing worried four year get three vendor duking deal land infrastructure might incentive price discount huge observation degree price discounting maybe could offer comment whether seeing little bit aggressive behavior amazon google sure yeah seen case course early conversation since azure since 2012 lot earlier one like think guy run cloud cheap think whatever whatever whatever really shifted significantly point last four year seen growth generally question cloud really like approach way worked mention lot way cost conversation went away reasonably early making decision actually karl keirstead jason zanderlanding cloud already lot cheaper go run environment first comparison start even cloud vendor duking also like well cost already need already going wind saving money particular case look mentioned like got big hyperscale vendor really competing going well one thing also betting investing heavily innovation around continue work margin continue work cost get eﬃciency relentless work space also think infrastructure absolutely opportunity strong business buy million thing time afford make good kind positive business structured way time also move mix shift going see little bit premium service right talking compute networking storage basic intrinsics start thinking data analytics stack also differentiated ai machine learning piece come along top start getting like power application power platform et cetera start business automation et cetera case going see premium mix shift continue kick also contributes overall number got look broadly business 24 growth constant currency overall commercial cloud business broad beyond azure growth 68 demonstrates like overall business keep mind hybrid perspective cloud got product allow handle little bit report way got feel like race vendor ibm cisco hp tried ibm still obviously backed fourth oracle knocking door want part party bidding large deal jason often seeing oracle table considered alternative generally seen go hyperscale cloud significant amount infrastructure work need typically competition often seattle competition northwest cloudy city kind competition often oracle perspective announce partnership oracle happy got additional thing coming see great karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zandercombination obviously lot fortune 100 firm heavily bet oracle got great solution trying go run top course want partnership oracle make go think worldwide footprint lot company deal want everywhere announced another region switzerland last week new region germany brings 56 region worldwide kind global coverage kind completeness portfolio see people interested future look like agreement oracle think got lot interest partnership well okay jason response question around pricing environment one thing mentioned microsoft confined internal datacenter eﬃciencies could offset unit pricing decline hit little bit hot subject group many invested supplier microsoft unique position day five year ago lot buying activity whole datacenter supply chain aggregated couple company cloudy northwest part country got amazing purchasing power everybody watch capex like five year ago talk little bit recently quarter two ago several supplier intel one many seeing demand pressure claiming quote hyperscales hyperscaler buyer holding back investment led consternation figure true anticipating slower azure growth finding replacement technology finding eﬃciency improvement got stage ask explain supplier pointing big cloud vendor suggesting slowing purchasing would happened yeah well mean would start framing growth mean think growth speaks multiple speaker obviously feel like growth perspective yeah still spending capex like guided going continue spend capex 5 billion coming quarter karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zanderyes exactly mean amy kind discussed disclosed money thing like datacenter expansion mention two well lot capex going towards additional expansion get market continue thing like obviously component buy server ﬂeet continue expand core part mentioned one thing pushing relentlessly eﬃciencies high scale game mean really excellent job every dollar spend product planning month semester boundary every time combination innovation bringing market new thing future going always commitment team eﬃciency thing done particular tuned supply chain lead time starting shrink get kind adjusting time need deliver making sure meeting demand carry lot excess capacity lot improvement continue make like buying supply storing top shelf six nine month bleeding correct way time yeah talk amy month ask money always remind yet clear maybe met amy going keep honest one improving constantly working think eﬃciencies get money spend continuing make better better every single quarter addition made lot software improvement done better job density host workload existing kit already bought give u even eﬃciency well essentially plus lot innovation across lot different part work think seen spending capex continue chase tam tam huge continuing grow seen growth come karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zanderthrough working hard eﬃciencies part house feel pretty good okay press much want give away azure trade secret public forum group curious exactly eﬃciency gain like field check folk engineer silicon valley tell anecdote azure able squeeze like 3x server rack today versus 18 month ago asked earth azure able get vague answer good give u anything specific driving eﬃciency gain think everybody super curious yeah tell element working right combination silicon design work work closely component partner thing like think storage think work done chip manufacturer component go part cost know whole silicon team like mentioned everything azure sphere optic hololens way quantum computing partner lot oems talking component manufacturer also lot specialization designed cloud partnership actually help u good job getting even eﬃciency addition lot additional work thing like sku mix also know like much ram much flash drive well turn running sap server look like something running gaming server actually cpu le disk able time look workload people running get right mix little bit secret sauce start actually tuning ﬂeet ﬂeet 100 uniform skus every single node pull look exactly wind right kind balance end day job really improve silicon utilization figure get great adjacency across workload actually share resource eﬃcient manner karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zanderi mean part mean hyper scale one thing big difference well got colo someplace lease know server server called fred run sap well cloud right mean literally million server able manage massive scale little bit trade secret side house get idea got okay thank talk security quick sec yes maybe two part one cap one aws breach high profile wondering interacted customer since noticed change behavior sort pulling back wanting double click azure security infrastructure way could way elongate sale cycle first question actually stop let go ask follow yeah would say especially large even fin sector folk know healthcare place compliance high would say always deep security vetting validation work see continue course question around specific thing seen case thing slightly differently stuff like see would tell big thing done security running cloud service 15 year go back oﬃce 365 even xbox live turn biggest hacking period get every single year december 24th evening basically people unwrapping new xbox get guy like want claim fame actually took network people whatever reason kid could play xbox old could play xbox mean whatever happens look like hack come long time spend 1 billion every single year security 3,500 people work done significant amount work protect oﬃce protect document take thing like trillion signal go system apply window apply oﬃce ecosystem actually make available third party well karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zander okay always lot scrutiny security especially true tier 1 workload start shift cloud get extra scrutiny welcome got broadest compliance portfolio cloud help security mean unfair amazon amazing organization larger azure nature going breach newspaper search breach feel like lot aws sort open s3 bucket problem like might cap one search high profile azure breach many maybe workload mix sure market share feel like disproportionately low number least hack azure wanted ask might azure judgement anything different aws secure data customer application yeah would say shared security perspective actually think cloud vendor vested making sure everyone safe secure cloud honest get point people worry cloud general good place go whether one vendor another could problematic overall business think dedicated even major attack occurred impact u actually hotline google hotline amazon security folk talk figure think kind greater good really trump competition around thing like come specific around azure though tell try compare contrast per se basically say mentioned security work done run oﬃce 365 15 year built azure get leverage tech built even top put best practice analyzer sort thing frankly window server sql server 20 year objective mean microsoft faced security crisis past long time ago kind trial fire change lot karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zanderof practice work order able protect ecosystem think learned lot accrued forward cloud cloud property technology approach taking side point also partnership customer running workload secure environment help tool make much much easier end day also apply security best practice workload make sure remain secure also trying call pit success like trying design product fall pit success make inadvertent accidental sort problem kind part product design ethos well got good partnership got might time sneak two go quick gaming excited gaming new azure workload anything azure infrastructure look feel different google amazon might make microsoft slightly better chance game streaming cloud front yeah well cool thing gaming actually old/new cloud workload actually running xbox live top azure long time fair point one first gaming service massive gaming service look going forward part think really crux asking game streaming awesome opportunity u think especially start immerse 5g edge compute starting become prevalent mean awesome opportunity already multiplayer game run online run azure datacenters go pop network get home imagine happens get edge compute protocol device go handle seen announced e3 cool streaming coming even phone mounted controller one pretty freaking awesome look thing online streaming gaming karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zandercommunity think seeing well lot content lot video lot sharing social starting evolve actually built top awesome base actually decade worth awesome innovation cool thing microsoft remember cloud streaming console long time pc gaming back think first one played flight sim anybody used flight sim remember microsoft golf anybody play back do era like damn old go way back modern stuff actually really cool okay last one got put forecasting hat ir cringing right know jason today hypothetically public cloud mix look something like 95/5 90/10 know number guy use internally look 10 year cloud mix going look like think going continue see growth see people move well actually lot net accretive new workload tell one really cool thing though hybrid since day one even mode mixture two made hybrid standard solution competitor paying lip service something since day one azure stack data box edge work done even new announcement made partnership vmware work think state company land going see workload running cloud native running cloud going able leverage existing system honestly fact invested since day one azure amazing line u incredibly well two decade basically mean usage stuff kind move environment actually great structural shape able handle take advantage thank jason coming honored able ﬂy join u meet client help think azure cloud business fun ride keep perfect thank much karl keirstead thank
