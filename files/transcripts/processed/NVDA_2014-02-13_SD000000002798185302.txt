good morning everybody welcome goldman sachs technology internet conference nvidia presentation u company today happy director investor relation chris evenden welcome chris thank good chris reported pretty fun quarter last night high end guidance guided little bit better maybe line seasonal higher base much higher base yes guess people saying hey pc back think clearly desktop business probably strongly notebook business fair say help u understand underlying dynamic really gaming application strong beyond pc market maybe talk kind underlying trend oem pc business well yes geforce product line graphic consumer informative way think like dividing gaming market james schneider chris evendenan oem market two market different dynamic jim alluding although said actually strong q4 oem one probably unexpectedly underlying trend gaming strong oem business weak oem business princely mainstream notebook lot pressure mainstream notebook market whole lot pressure right know think additional pressure within graphic within mainstream notebook well think lot pressure business gaming however actually strong profitable actually slowly growing business within pc market take ca take homogenous view pc market distinct segment gaming estimate growing 10 year obviously q4 strong quarter gaming also lot game come q4 people buy gpus gamers buy gpus want better gpu buy gpus want play battlefield 4 feature turned want pay blade soul think reason mentioned blade soul game launched china last quarter tencent new departure much higher production value typical china although talking one game think significant difference raised level expectation game china look like pretty excited china historically 40 geforce revenue rule thumb get moving term asp exciting opportunity u dynamic market strong would say underlying trend pc gaming continue strong oem think somewhat headwind next 12 month seeing kind tailwind market share versus amd kind strong share still ﬂat market market share number come today tomorrow think see word caution market share number unit share lot difference oem business gaming business term asp term gross margin well actually move excuse move market share significantly actually probably move profit dollar inaudible one quarter like q3 last year actually lost market share increased dollar share market good data market share one data point got cautious interpreting literally money made business talking graphic card retail like 150 1000 james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evendenreally starting sort level stupendously expensive money going got relative q1 guidance think guided revenue think 8 sequentially midpoint maybe talk moving piece within clearly lot one tegra seasonality particularly weaker q1 nobody really know seasonality tesla professional business help u kind break apart seasonality core pc gaming franchise versus rest yes think seasonality really dangerous concept come nvidia think implies know something look historically business done probably underlying seasonality god lot noise top seasonality well diﬃcult use basis term guiding q1 think guided pretty much line everybody else stronger q4 everybody else even go 8 midpoint q1 still give u stronger look like q3 q1 still stronger pretty much peer think q3 q1 think good guidance 10 moving part within certainly geforce business significantly desktop gaming oem significantly period time professional business strong think offset tegra wherever tegra end helpful want kind switch near term kind product side thing minute announced latest tegra series tegra k1 back consumer electronics show think metric put around say 65 le power given performance 40 performance given power think said basically help u understand first advantage k1 relative tegra 4 past advantage relative competitor like solution even competitive solution like x o apple ipad yes question answer first time got pc plus gpu inside mobile power fit get wrong fit within mobile power run 5 watt tablet run 2 watt phone still term per watt raw performance pc class mean mean feature open gl directtouch 11 worked epic support unreal engine 4 unreal engine one james schneider chris evendenthe popular game engine world today mean make easy game developer take game already exists another platform make pretty trivial actually port tegra k1 fact one demo showed analyst day pc demo running tegra k1 another one inaudible ce one pc demo running tegra k1 unreal engine another one actually ps4 demo think unreal engine tegra k1 show easy transfer contract across course big deal software developer little incremental asset make game available android thing brings cuda gpu gpu program inaudible cuda 192 processor core mobile give lot option term feature add gpu good taking data turning image actually really good taking image turning data image processing bunch highly powered computing task well demonstrated automotive context term identifying white line road reading road sign side measuring distance car front thing fundamental building block advanced driver assistance system phone tablet well gesture control facial recognition apps high dynamic range photography apps run cuda well lot feature performance brings call tegra 5 felt suﬃciently big inaudible emphasize fact got kepler core tegra k1 well term differentiation part fundamental strategy term gaming android android ubiquitous everywhere believe android matures platform distinct segment crystallize android market one gaming vanguard intend incumbent market solidifies part bit chicken egg problem sense game developer want develop game got installed base hardware manufacturer want build installed base got game invest build gaming ecosystem android tegra k1 part investment shield part investment game work team tony tamasi part investment well team several hundred engineer work game developer bring content platform thing think build gaming android build strong defensible profitable segment mentioned inaudible side get back look kind rest tegra focused much see tablet platform versus smart phone platform think kind dual core quad core version product james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evendenso definitely tablet phone said last year well jammy came along big phone would say strategically much focused tablet room differentiate visual experience bigger screen fundamentally yes put way dual core versus quad depends application hard specific certain amount generously call market texture come core processor eight core obviously better four even though ca actually demonstrate sense work consumer eight bigger number four definitely help place type architecture importance nvidia another market texture kind thing actually real application multiple speaker really wanting use multiple speaker software silicon chicken egg situation well need 64 apps take advantage architecture come clearly market going direction five year time wo debate 32 bit versus 64 bit everyone 64 bit whole range question benefit accrue first think first think benefit u sense apps support fact pitch consumer got tablet guy got tablet absolutely element absolutely well feature application take advantage architecture available got want understand modem strategy area made investment acquisition icera definitely done proof point last year got cagr certified think pretty big success yes james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden talk critical integrated modem versus discrete modem overall mobile strategy really diﬃcult thought going ask much easier question think modem let answer easy question change subject move modem think incredibly important think connectivity cellular connectivity going crucial whether car whether tablet whether gaming device whether need discrete integrated actually much diﬃcult philosophical question integrated principal advantage integrated cheaper argue also power segment power segment really trivial meaningful sense also ﬂoor plan saving integrated space play ﬂoor plan pretty darn big phone really constrained ﬂoor plan stand compete high end relatively small cost saving make break feature advantage going discrete interact quickly reduce risk iterate separately two complex process time without impelling schedule play discrete actually good solution said absolutely market segment point get price becomes imperative point integrated becomes much important want kind touch obvious question design win think couple different juncture past performance leadership blown away competition positive performance different kind performance metric really translated market share give confidence year going year different term either tablet smartphone design win something simply looking mobile world congress computex beyond say ah understand think design win traction importantly outward visibility yes pretty good visibility certainly phone side le tablet shorter product cycle diﬃcult discus james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evendenwithout verging guiding year absolutely want guide year proven diﬃcult thought think tegra k1 device shipping first half device shipping second half tegra 4i smartphones shipping first half well term number stuff want dive rat hole understand think k1 first one kind introduced denver core talked yes talked denver core long time really bring table developer consumer first platform available give performance feature platform give adjustable memory space platform think first market certainly first demonstrate android running see go kind threshold performance example automotive market machine vision kind stuff could got capital application say really crossed threshold enables multiple speaker application really good question sure got good answer image processing run cuda course fully programmable gpu much place image analysis cpu got 192 core running massively parallel problem like image processing make much sense gpu cpu good example enables different platform sure somewhere work figure get example right james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider kind next natural question related hey got data center player grid tesla etc arm processor market lot performance go several market well different inaudible differentiation service today power processing whether tesla grid power processing different succeeding mean look tesla tesla growing strongly grew 37 last year would expect carry growing year well profitable business know grid revenue point right number trial increasing increased 40 quarter quarter number trial purchase cycle enterprise 18 24 month turn revenue revenue number point right look pretty interesting going like general arm server inaudible something like need differentiator cavium mcc would talk networking infrastructure amd would well extent amd would probably also talk real experience year opteron business intel rumor qualcomm samsung bunch people space well think going space small number customer well look market think sound like big market actually probably gone first three customer suddenly much smaller market think diﬃcult place never say never right look like diﬃcult place thanks thanks yes okay got automotive one clearly demonstrated level traction audi kind car machine vision kind capability chris evenden james schneider chris evendenand actually given number said believe 450 million calendar 2015 think around 100 million last year yes go increasing rapid rate think said say 100 million 200 million 400 million number gave mentioned earnings call yesterday 2 billion pipeline think number confident know exactly 2 billion going arrive model moving different quarter basic point billion dollar order commitment order technical diﬃculty technical term commitment design win pipeline obviously good business product cycle long real differentiation business well regard processing advanced driver system everyone looking also term actually even raw graphic performance starting really matter car whether quickly nav system update announces many update second really annoying go moving full digital dash instead physical dial needle actually pixel audi announcing ce part audi announcing tegra 3 going powering next generation digital cockpit graphic actually matter quality expense quality experience car heavily inﬂuenced quality inaudible around interface car large extent used inlaid walnut handstitched leather dash said something quality car really quality pixel got especially good quality display experience look car put electronics wrong think going important differentiator u interesting related point sign post look say oh wow see design coming going auto show ce come yes got design win people might even announce year inaudible design long two largest customer right volkswagen audi group bmw whole range audi car think a3 golf volkswagen golf always interesting debate marketing department whenever produce slide like put tesla lamborghini automotive slide would like put golf automotive slide james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneiderwe bmw i3 going i8 launched 3 5 7 tesla obviously whole bunch skoda actually european room actually recognize brand well skoda come long way point bentley lamborghini go full gamut another couple major automotive manufacture announced yet part 2 billion pipeline well great want shift core gpu business second maxwell product said going launch year lot speculation trade press kind relatively imminent 20 nanometer product personal growth reading form know right know firsthand help u understand understand want preannounce product today understand spagie macro come whether expect kind traditional nvidia launch kind start high end waterfall inaudible much want say absolutely nothing say talk never talk product announced gpu market competitive market product quite perishable typically like cycle done move onto next one want maximize every hour revenue generating ability product literally launch almost always actually available sale day tip hand competitor find maxwell matter people buy matter say maxwell right one buy anyway matter competitive maxwell launch obviously make empty statement great feel going see review go live want ask notebook business still material chunk business talked dynamic want ask market share think time certainly visibility happened etc talk directionally feel notebook oem share position head end year chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden visibility sure want share much oem thing introduces uncertainty exactly oems refresh line cadence change cadence number probably talk actually know certain right know design slot know scheduled start shipping know design win know scheduled start shipping know translate market share like said market share data great hand got careful swayed large number unit low profit well find fact q3 last year actually according mercury number market share went dollar share clearly went careful data good want steer anyone away using data ever hand want caution people reading much misleading term market share unit unit gpu 12 making 25 gross margin low end ship 1 million hardly shift profit dollar one company yes switching professional second talking profit dollar yes exactly let go one extreme quadro actually pretty good last year think guess part best year ever actually quadro last year actually record yes think part tablet refresh part arguably kind customer set coming back automotive industrial yes james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden multiple speaker use cyclical balance big growth quadro head 2014 think normalize see continued headwind kind overall market impact think term product launch anniversarying whatever rbc tell u 81 market share unit share workstation believe 90 dollar share mean market movement significant share gain loss bunch initiative place grow market intended grow market nevertheless dominant term equation like market actually go use market data predict quadro go quadro 80 quadro revenue manufacturing gdp generally good good get term indicator way business going go would look look manufacturing going next 12 month think going strong would tell something quadro market think weak time think sort recovered rational level last year see normalizing back particularly time would want guide towards like 20 growth something multiple speaker probably grow like last year growth yes thank press room communicator guess want ask tesla area think hard investor kind see like really going hood kind buried p l report also know lumpy tied kind supercomputing specific big customer build oem based think tesla business big last year kind directionally going drive growth 2014 break separately grew lot last year grew nearly 40 year last year thing really excites tesla business actually love tesla business really broken think sense couple year puttering along sort level 25 million quarter thereabouts james schneider chris evendenand sort puzzling clearly go hpc show would much enthusiasm much passion see tesla every booth whether ibm booth supermicro booth cray booth people using engineer scientist engineer poster session would incredible application tesla clearly inaudible yet 25 million 25 million 25 million every quarter really broken think reason broken two thing actually one support critical number code work done taking code regular architecture pc parallel architecture like tesla two channel term supermicro dell hp ibm cray guy whereas past year ago 18 month ago tesla team would gone person engineering firm evangelize product evangelize first sold shipped right point could guy researcher johnson johnson looking protein interaction know need molecular dynamic know tesla accelerated molecular dynamic code know get tesla server ibm dial ibm salesman get delivered tuesday completely different sale made big difference think retrospect 25 million represented team capable personally supporting directly got people supporting u announcement made last quarter ibm gm business think significant announcement made year sense got ibm salesperson enthusiastically selling tesla account pretty big deal ibm responsible nearly third supercomputing installation worldwide pretty important also interestingly looking applying gpu acceleration enterprise apps well whole new market u long way saying reason believe strong growth tesla would continue would expect strong growth continue got remiss ask financial question ask gross margin first maybe talk capital return quickly gross margin done great job expanding gross margin part past several year part intel licensing agreement gross margin course part also foundry agreement allowed really kind basically take ownership yield think mostly mix actually think much expanded gross margin previous ramp record gross margin 46.3 time frankly ati produced decent graphic card three year market basically james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evendenwe bit lower last quarter guided recover slightly quarter 10 point margin come intel better negotiation sole supplier semiconductor easy negotiation might imagine came mix developed quadro business developed tesla business gaming business becoming profitable well gpu business becoming affordable whole bunch thing pushed margin 1000 basis point couple year sound like would expect big structural kind underlying change drive would mix said mix right multiple speaker get profitable professional mix grows yes exactly oem business declining year tailwind gross margin tesla growing tail end margin see good know good see tegra well yes capital return done great job taken 1.5 billion inaudible form convert presumably going mostly share buyback yes think appetite even beyond clearly firepower balance sheet yes 1.5 billion give u ﬂexibility inaudible well said would return 1 billion year dividend account rough number 160 million james schneider chris evenden james schneiderthat maybe 180 million something range rest share repurchase point year yes appetite even still still like said left end year let reconsider let see great think time thanks chris u
