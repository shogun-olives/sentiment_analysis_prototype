linking exposure actual sale right much like able monitor ability team drive particular engagement new feature facebook marketer linking actual scanner data supermarket level right mean early game category think auto think travel think financial service kind tough frankly measure effectiveness sometimes beginning kind measurement revolution well think general one thing made reference earlier young people looking role facebook place like u think general early broader cultural point absolutely example advertiser might consider traditional using tool really well one favorite example one canadian tire spent time canada know canadian tire get know canadian tire sell lot tire canadian tire really wonderful example large stopped running newspaper insert reason done found ability run
