hi elon welcome tesla solar glass unveil brief introduction go question intent behind sort solar glass roof make roof come alive live roof instead dead roof roof gathering sunlight anything intent convert sunlight energy think future odd roof dormant dead gather energy ask future want future think want well u future look around neighborhood roof gathering energy something useful look beautiful robust resilient powering house shelter think want say actually 20 year look around neighborhood solar glass roof going make financial sense somebody relatively new roof roof integrated solar power generation therefore cost roofing house addition cost solar panel solar cell however able achieve version 3 cost price point le average roof cost plus solar panel looking 2 option one need roof either need new roof need reroof house look cost average cost cost adding solar panel roof versus cost tesla solar glass integrated roof plus solar panel solar cell solar glass roof cost le best knowledge accurate obviously see debuted whether correct mean going correct everywhere going time cheap roof cheap solar panel maybe corner case cheaper think maybe 80 time tesla solar glass roof make economic sense look best longest lasting intent quite hard get point quite diﬃcult product roof last long time add electrification roof obviously fair bit complexity wire need make sure going safe cause risk house also last many decade mean want last something order 30 year easy accelerated live testing want say okay well course say six month try accelerate life roof know like 30 year quite hard system extremely robust figuring install effectively actually going like install kind got fremont factory 2 house identical 2 competing team install solar glass roof eﬃciently going try get like best roofing team country also give shot tesla internal actually say solar glass roof going start tesla installers something intend open roofing contractor general unlike vehicle sale go tesla store online sort want get trapped like franchise law lot complexity automotive distribution kind break precedent highly problematic potentially many place tesla solar glass roof think different situation like local sale monopoly highly competitive market think going make sense therefore like tesla certified installers going install solar glass roof think powerful driver demand allow u grow much faster could otherwise grow operator elon r. musk andrew d. baglinoand going produced giga new york factory buffalo people working really hard like say appreciation team really putting pretty huge effort ramp production solar glass roof pretty impressed visited earlier year like okay seems like lot ton people seems like good situation think definitely make proud factory look going great yes think like really cool product well like said nutshell getting new roof reroofing getting new roof feel like feel quite confident smart move already roof already new smart move financially may still want going financially punitive existing roof still long way go existing roof lot lot life left would recommend tesla solar panel like get solar retrofit call right move roof still like say 10 year life tesla solar glass new roof reroofing right move like question repeat question try best answer question answer thank start call question related solar roof retail investor say.com justin asks change tesla implemented v1 v2 v3 impact cost performance mean quite change also drew kunal guy want sort answer change made lot yes mean really wanted achieve goal let involves assessing cost beauty installability manufacturability across ax run key point increased size tile increased power density tile dramatically reduced number part subassemblies tile half go direction lower cost easier manufacturability also changed material use changed method using technology using achieve hidden solar cell something scalable elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino say like one hardest thing say solar glass roof seeing solar cell beneath glass would kind putting see cell hard part want photon sun get solar cell create something aesthetically unappealing quite hard challenge yes solar cell optically isotropic meaning look purple one angle green another number different iteration technology experiment landed technology get solar tile point anisotropic blend surrounding nonsolar tile trim look angle exactly thing let view helicopter may look weird helicopter even still look damn good key aspect focusing installation really wanted achieve installation time faster new roof plus traditional panel well fact trying improve even installation time roof yes think right tooling equipment especially paying close attention edge effect multiple plane roof meet think add apply world best engineering think actually solar glass roof installed faster comp shingle like target elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino kunal girotra elon r. musk kunal girotra elon r. muskthat clear goal yes definitely moving quickly coming comp shingle installs part ambition achieve key part installability looking part get factory field roof come together roof lot iteration final thing would mention ﬂashings sort like edge trim trimming roof would say early version product almost like custom handicraft done thought lot problem come beautiful solution achievable field yes totally kunal installers working hard installing already seen much simpler faster lot intuitive install thing guy said led really fast install time targeting even faster comp shingle yes yes think comfortable get actually yes quite bit r installation process difference simple tool one way dramatically affect install cost time also important like least amount bother like hard house new roof put occur within like basically entire roof 8 hour quite important literally come back go work come back got new roof generating electricity well target roof see done roofing company yes yes kind like roofing company going sort install roof andrew d. baglino elon r. musk operator elon r. musk operator elon r. musk yes even building building yes yes alexander asks expect solar roof v3 available wide residential adoption yes actually yes simply go website enter address place order right installation ramping fast possibly starting next week actually think actually underway right yes mean goal actually get north 1,000 roof per week quickly possible always hard predict early stage production ramp thing move fast slowest item think next several month well past 1,000 roof week think goal robert asks current solar roof production capacity think production ramp 2020 feeling demand well think really going much demand problem honest think demand far excess supply always diﬃcult predict supply production ramp almost always look like start slow first number constraint could trivial part limiting production ramp still limit production ramp missing even simplest item one little thing taking longer expected set total production rate mean essentially impossible predict accuracy part production think predict start ﬂatten like much predictable think say like probably several month able 1,000 roof week think answer yes long term want obviously like 10,000 roof week 20,000 roof week think like addressable market something order 100 million house worldwide obviously want ramp quickly possible starting kind textured black glass hopefully able bring operator elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk kunal girotra elon r. muskvolume production variance solar glass roof know every 6 nine month something like one challenging achieving good sort earth tone solar glass roof meaning like clay tile type thing doable harder achieve right look something maybe order year away something like yes see john asks tesla handle logistics installation already partnership installation company plan yet installation company current plan announced broad brush stroke internal installation crew feel like hitting kind ﬂat positive part learning curve bring outside roofing company installers say okay help u make better think see rapid improvement solar roof installation timing like said version 3 really like first version think ramped scale often true new technology like window 1 2 really work frankly window 3 first big one sort like 3.1 something yes know 3.1 true old school 3.1 0.1 release sort 0.1 3 minus 1 really giant bug think true think like version 2 hopefully would 3.1 case going keep improving roof scale hiring lot installers yes hiring lot installers yes kunal girotra elon r. musk operator elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk operator q kyle field elon r. muskas well partnering installation company week come lot action deploying product yes john say.com buffalo manufacture solar plan add cell production manufacture powerwall/packs well giga 1 focus vehicle cell sure yes giga 2 already producing solar supercharger actually manufactured today along inverter powerpack power electronics upcoming megapack yes real center excellence power electronics couple well solar think frequently coupled solar yes regarding beyond solar roof solar power electronics plan moment really primarily solar glass roof buffalo factory focus consumption worldwide going start u.s. need tight feedback loop issue fix rapidly scale already something provide worldwide first question phone line come kyle field clean technician kyle cleantechnica cost solar roof big barrier version 2 speak little bit relative improvement cost version 2 version 3 solar glass roof q kyle field elon r. musk andrew d. baglino q kyle field elon r. musk kunal girotrayes right mean version 2 expensive like making ton money basically trying lose money version worth scaling expensive think version 3 something think get cost average roof plus retrofit solar panel feel pretty good cost structure worth going big time version okay actually sorry also say like one thing obviously delayed tesla solar general focus 18 24 month focus entire company model 3 model 3 production ramp really kind stripped resource solar 1.5 year thereabouts make model 3 work tesla would exist model 3 relatively smooth operation able redirect resource towards solar stationary storage true make sense actually version 2 solar roof house installation process look like kind lego version building death star roof talk little bit guy done streamline process feel like major barrier cost speed installation sure yes talk installation improvement mean one big thing drew elon touched upon installed v2 2 roofing plane met roof plane edge call edge condition like cut tile v2 cumbersome process took lot time created lot wastage needed extra tool gotten rid v3 big major improvement total number material part reduction v2 v3 massively reduced number touch installers reduces time take install elon r. musk operator q phil lebeau elon r. musk q phil lebeau kunal girotra operatorso ton timing improvement like made across product make installs really fast advantage tesla vertically integrated chain team engineer installers working day night test home giving rapid iterative feedback improve minor installation eﬃciencies lot edge condition basically nightmare version 2 quite artisanal like artisanal glass factory lot like final production actually house sort like building airplane finish production runway great next question come phil lebeau cnbc elon quick question installation crew give u sense many crew currently staﬃng per crew 3 people 4 people primarily based california right give u kind geographic sense well sure like really trying think current like number crew sure particularly helpful end customer like really meant call explaining product consumer opposed sort finance call something like well looking finance trying get sense guy talking wanting ramp trying get sense ability right term hi planning 2,000 crew 3,000 crew capacity like let put way installed tesla solar 25 state country definitely installing solar roof state already energy warehouse installing solar roof well elon said expanding across country crew well crew say right 25 state installing solar solar roof state well q sean andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk operator q kimberly javaheriour next question come sean verge sound like little bit simplified stuff make little easier install new version maybe little bit going tile tell sort process went make sure run sort production issue previous version yes think like issue prior version much production installation problematic could ramped production version 2 would run fundamental obstacle diﬃculty installation wondering like run diﬃculty ramping version 3 absolutely like ton massive amount diﬃculty go ton pain like step back want clear applied preventative measure however reducing number part subassemblies half dramatically reduced number processing step manufacturing step simplifies manufacturing ramp say early production right gone smoothly ramp find thing overcome early production look good far yes always quite sort jumpy thorny sort basis think year pretty smooth sailing like said actually feel like get folk short term think understand like product going go long term go say want world want world look like like want future look around house neighborhood generating electricity beautiful course future need make happen next question come kim javaheri youtube channel like tesla elon r. musk kunal girotra elon r. musk kunal girotra andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk kunal girotrai curious could elaborate little warranty like tile using roofer affect warranty yes sure kunal yes version offering warranty weatherization power 130 mile per hour wind resistance hail resistance 25 year warranty right yes mean thing fairly standard roofing industry derivative yes yes definitely answer right kind like frankly kind like weird sort odd product like really care like would anyone make solar roof strange thing going make yes going real confusing like actual product like nature product one comment like installers warranty work mean roofing work today right like manufacturer tile asphalt shingle square certified installer roofer trained audited install correctly eventually warranty extended installer would expect u anything different product quite big market roof actually mean order 100 million roof north america get replaced every 25 year set like maybe 4 million roof year 4 million roof andrew d. baglino elon r. musk operator q roberto baldwin elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino 5 million new home year mean sorry 1 million new home yes 1 million new home year like order 5 million north america 5 world population thereabouts quite big market think going production sort installation constrained going mean percentage basis grow like kelp steroid like many thing sorted think going exciting product like kind thing think people want want roof way yes next question come roberto baldwin engadget curious energy eﬃciency tile virtually panel let say 200 square foot area tile 200 square foot area panel like difference conversion sure slight impact well target equivalent better benefit solar roof smaller like integer size think granularity basically put question like cell eﬃciency purely looking cell eﬃciency basis always going take knockdown order better aesthetic knockdown want keep knockdown something order maybe 10 hopefully le drew like saying le like best case like ideally like effect energy eﬃciency cell level put far cell roof without affecting aesthetic fact ca even tell one active one panel panel active one active total power generated roof significantly greater solar glass roof yes ever solar mean drive around neighborhood look home see quantization problem panel like got skylight got stove pipe restoration elon r. musk kunal girotra elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino operator q darrell etherington roof messy complicated way generally look terrible normally pay attention roof normally pay attention roof like wow lot trouble finding roof like want looking roof easy finding picture good roof let tell diﬃcult also giant part task reason equivalent better better almost case power generation consumer standpoint better outcome right move going get new roof solar panel solar glass roof integrated cell maybe better outcome believe home term economics power generation aesthetic durable yes want add one comment married particular solar cell technology aesthetic solution solar cell get better solar roof also get better important target team make sure let stick legacy source technology increase energy solar although solar eﬃciency quite plateaued yes yes next question come darrell etherington techcrunch wondering see potential format incarnation technology might enter market different way offered consumer different way elon r. musk operator q hope king elon r. musk q hope king elon r. musk yes really scaling one variant kind like textured black glass look time want like roof sort earth tone like sort like clay tile want one look like french slate house like black textured glass especially sort mediterranean architecture going look place making work next agenda product development standpoint term significant improvement significant say variant improvement like getting earth tone version look right next major challenge ensuring team think get time probably next year next question come hope king cheddar consumer standpoint especially seen happen california mean pg e say could take another 10 year outage ratcheted significantly elon tweeting recently get folk order tesla solar powerwall already seeing order grow demand grow result outage yes think seeing demand growth result yes reason turn light people want keep happening next 10 year obvious solution sort sitting dark device battery powered lose phone connection like security risk mean ca even call 911 like problem definitely seeing people interested solar plus powerwall battery blackout renewable energy yes definitely seeing demand increase result think continue see future important also developing overall tesla energy ecosystem guy want build yes think important fundamental goal tesla accelerate advent sustainable energy therefore generate energy sustainable way really mean solar primarily view solar residential level commercial level utility level since sun obviously shine night operator q karissa bell elon r. musk q karissa bell elon r. muskand like cloudy weather time storage continuous power really 3 part sustainable energy future tesla standpoint solar power generation storing solar stationary storage powerwall power pack megapack consuming energy sustainable way mean electric transport think fundamental good tesla view degree accelerate advent sustainable energy future next question come karissa bell mashable talked lot kind improving installation process making eﬃcient lot faster wondering kind talk little bit sort anticipating wait time like people make reservation preorder kind long anticipating wait actually able get installed well depends many people sign solar glass roof lot people depend sort queue thing accordingly know might month wait several month think sooner people sign le time wait grow exponentially know might like doubling every month something like want get point next year short wait time possible best achieve anticipate anticipate installation process help speed thing overall like much eﬃcient reservation installation version 1 2 yes really intended easy install continue improvement make version 3 actually mostly related edge condition like essentially corner roof plane roof meet edge roof rain gutter kind thing rapid evolution edge condition detail think key growing rapidly like said getting install time typical roof 8 hour mean really think better basically fairly big crew attack roof kind like surgical strike get done quickly versus small number people take long time roof minimizes done fast minimizes inconvenience homeowner andrew d. baglino kunal girotra elon r. musk kunal girotra elon r. musk andrew d. baglino kunal girotra elon r. musk operator le setup tear time every day fewer truck roll totally yes installing starting next month california already customer lined one comment wait time actually employing wait time one thing consider weather place like buried covered snow like obviously wait time rainy ultimately yes mean guess intention roof want install faster traditional roof installed benchmark calling somebody saying want new roof getting roof installed like soon weather good exactly product work yes like seamless easy wait long time right cool think probably last question thanks everyone joining look forward look forward installing ultimately million roof thanks thank lady gentleman concludes today conference call
