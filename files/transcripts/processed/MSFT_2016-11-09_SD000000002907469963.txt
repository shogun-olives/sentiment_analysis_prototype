technical diﬃculty microsoft conference today microsoft takeshi numoto takeshi cvp enterprise cloud run marketing function front row mat mcbride work takeshi senior director finance business unit course omnipresent zack moxcey investor relation zack asked read little regulatory blurb begin microsoft may make statement presentation refer sec filing risk factor relating business true whether person listening web takeshi let start maybe start role first help u understand actually role adjunct microsoft 20 year would love get perspective microsoft today relative microsoft seen last number year first name takeshi numoto corporate vice president cloud enterprise marketing responsible basically going market driving worldwide marketing strategy microsoft application platform infrastructure service server product includes product like azure public cloud service well server product window server sql server software tool like visual studio portfolio product well business application around dynamic 365 get work wide portfolio product company 19 year quite 20 year yet started actually one engineer window nt around ross macmillan takeshi numoto ross macmillan takeshi numototruly inspiring see customer technology day transformational impact business really exciting time great let start azure math 3 billion revenue run rate business actually accelerating kind amazing scale also pretty amazing think probably five year ago revenue amazing business according math according math maybe let talk differentiator know microsoft player know friend amazon aws really kind maybe ph catalyst market let talk make microsoft different talking customer think great question think lot cloud dialogue see people focus specific property azure oﬃce 365 individual portfolio important u one key thing rallying behind whole notion microsoft cloud talk microsoft cloud basically handle representing commercial cloud service offering includes azure constituent service underneath azure well oﬃce 365 dynamic 365 think differentiation highest level individual property level microsoft cloud differentiated think really boil three thing one global scale reach offer take azure region example one region talk azure region one data center essentially logical representation multiple data center within sort network latency represent one logical construct customer thing essentially span multiple data center time 38 essentially offer choice customer partner term deploy solution closer market closer customer closer company partner employee huge benefit offer think really sort inaudible enterprise requirement u one key design point microsoft cloud really designing enterprise enterprise requirement afterthought relates second point sense notion really meeting requirement something privilege working many many business customer size large small really feel like sense going deep customer understanding business requirement investing need technology engage customer support lifecycle product consumption part really making sure helping comfortable us technology cloud trust huge element deep investment sort security capability well compliance certification everyone ph think compliance certification compliance certification global cloud vendor horizontal certification whether talk numerous certification around iso iso well soft one two ph also vertical one like kitsa ph pci whatnot broadest portfolio compliance certification essentially designed reduce increased comfort confidence trusting customer able use cloud really paying well thirdly really hybrid think approach know despite fact reason giving choice customer able deploy application solution closest targeted area also want build region every country every geography whole notion able offer solution let customer essentially use prem almost enterprise customer investment asset building technology really deep comprehensive let use already prem thing cloud taking synergistic copacetic sale something feel like uniquely positioned provide cloud service also deliver software customer use premise enables u go beyond hybrid sense narrowly connectivity oftentimes get talked connectivity thing connect prem cloud much deeper oftentimes maybe people talk infrastructure hybrid sense may able move storage around compute around u hybrid far deeper really platform consistency productivity like oﬃce 365 way thing like application platform data platform like sql identity management like baked actually deep hybrid way infrastructure way ross macmillan takeshi numotoup application layer feel like something really resonating customer three thing global trusted hybrid last point kind dovetail little bit commentary around higher tier service big message microsoft think evolution azure service continuing add incremental value stack curious think customer journey azure way u sort think typically approached customer start look customer advanced platform going question answer think consistent pattern see customer journey cloud regardless entry point mean different customer start different asset cloud customer start essentially consuming saas service first might go deploy oﬃce 365 might deploy dynamic 365 first entry cloud consumption cloud customer start infrastructure okay want drive storage cloud move virtual machine cloud kind approach third inaudible essentially customer saying want essentially net new thing cloud investment going continue harvest net new application particularly one extend capability already premise perhaps web mobile device cloud provides great leverage point able think application modernization new application typical three entry point customer start using cloud common pattern see matter start amongst three entry point end needing element saas infrastructure level service whether machine learning whether face detection voice detection thing like application cloud consumption pattern basically become increasingly sophisticated customer need vendor essentially address portfolio need business think sort feel uniquely positioned azure microsoft cloud approach able offer thing need journey cloud includes also thing like ross macmillan takeshi numoto ross macmillan takeshi numoto ross macmillanmanagement security capability advanced analytics data level data service would probably classify service thing embraced open source way microsoft historically done made comment much 30 workload think running linux o opposed traditional microsoft window o important messaging important customer consider azure think huge boon cloud business frankly become really clearer around sort core goal around driving azure consumption end furtherance customer business transformation cloud course continued invest heavily software ip asset great customer use software top cloud kind best combination software purview basically particular individual product goal essentially driving cloud adoption helping customer transform business broad consumption cloud primary goal order really deeply embrace notion basically want ph pursuing kind pro inaudible kind bring skill set consumer cloud based skill set already invested heavily operating system support linux variant also lot open framework whether database level language level name low dev ph python php invested deeply able recruit developer skill set able productively use azure like said quarter azure vms region running linux inaudible cloud right huge inaudible standpoint exciting u driving new growth yes let ingest workload regardless platform good thing microsoft yes last thing wanted touch azure maybe little esoteric something amazon done guess called nomenclature service serviceless computing function lambda microsoft something called azure function takeshi numoto ross macmillan takeshi numoto ross macmillan takeshi numotoand hear wanted spend minute maybe could talk u getting airtime becoming something hearing market well basically sort talked serverless compute basically essentially server running time may idle actually able compute capacity demand something invoked message come signal come right processing time right actually shuts job done kind whole notion whether lambda azure function one another element essentially cloud computing bringing eﬃciencies overall compute think overall journey started basically bare metal server would virtualize mean actually virtualize essentially pack virtual machine given hardware box overall hardware utilization higher kind another way take next step wo address customer scenario best sort fit purpose fit thing would initially use every scenario certainly one scenario extends cloud computing eﬃciency something offer azure function well boost eﬃciency vendor provisioning standpoint also customer standpoint prepurchasing compute capacity buying reserved instance basically putting app consume need demand arise exactly yes let talk little bit oﬃce minute 85 million active user commercial oﬃce 365 product really impressive thing really interesting see growth still 40 guess one question clear oﬃce 365 actually driving new user platform held analyst day maybe year half ago talked unit growth within oﬃce franchise love talk minute oﬃce 365 able term attracting new user platform product think pretty mature ross macmillan takeshi numotoyes background right actually current role four year actually got eight year working oﬃce including actually launching oﬃce 365 great see technical diﬃculty different role oﬃce 365 growing seeing tremendous success customer right 40 see ph growth actually representing think 56 revenue growth see growth actually driving average revenue per customer well growing one phenomenon’s really encouraging u see oﬃce 365 momentum actually resulting increasing install base oﬃce pure substitution actually adding overall install base oﬃce great impact actually moving selling pure essentially desktop application like word excel powerpoint actually selling service includes email includes collaboration seeing reﬂected essentially upper uplift seeing install base increase upper uplift great see driving higher tier skus well e3 e4 e5 offer adding whether business intelligence capability unified communication capability something expect sort path could see value higher tier skus sort sit continuum sort higher arpu time think logical thing u continue think like think transition oﬃce 365 essentially traditional license business perhaps highest economic case lifetime value standpoint take transactional customer may bought license every year subscription relationship certainly increase way deliver value customer therefore increase lifetime value customer certainly also want increase aperture value deliver whether going pure desktop set application plus collaboration communication okay certainly seeing see growth arpu growth like talked next step continue drive logical u say hey additional value subscription relationship add right ca talk next right really excited opportunity around oﬃce 365 eply ph offer certainly really seeing lot resident customer security value ross macmillan takeshi numoto ross macmillan takeshi numotoproposition represents also really liking fact also let u offering essentially position u participate additional adjacent market opportunity area like business intelligence voice security obviously last couple year number acquisition microsoft security domain maybe high level help u understand weaving new security functionality oﬃce azure product feel like become elevated part strategy absolutely particularly work customer help take advantage cloud security huge issue want make sure address one thing focused essentially drive security intrinsic part workload deliver thinking security kind bonus ph product side security infused additional capability oﬃce 365 security infused intrinsic value proposition window security infusing part manage mobile device em seeing tremendous amount success across product portfolio whenever infuse security value proposition workload go market whether oﬃce 365 whether m window mass ph threat protection essentially also making easier customer sort secure employee base across board offering called secure productive enterprise make super easy customer one transaction cover employee whether security technology window security technology baked oﬃce 365 across device em enterprise mobility suite grew 85 technical diﬃculty tremendous amount success kind approaching term infusing security deeply workload deliver essentially making sure work seamlessly across monetized said infusing product portfolio becomes part offer basically lot time part higher edition offer security always one thing want make sure even baseline product secure want able layer additional value proposition perspective ross macmillan takeshi numotoand oﬃce 365 e5 one let way layering strategic value proposition top base oﬃce 365 workload window enterprise essentially also delivers additional enterprise treatment technical diﬃculty additional security capability top would get window subscription well em essentially let deliver mobile device management mobile application management across device able deliver security capability think essentially value proposition infusing product also layering top workﬂows great last thing wanted touch announcement earlier year dynamic 365 business maybe high level talk u different dynamic 365 versus dynamic customer standpoint would look say new something get microsoft taking different approach dynamic 365 traditional way bizapp think vendor gone market sort segregation different functionality business processing piece sort notion crm versus erp separate separation largely sort vendoring use notion sense customer standpoint want able solution go lead way cash order fulfillment basically dynamic 365 essentially unified traditional used crm erp offering one cloud service go across entire business oﬃce lead order fulfillment way time unifying also made modular purpose built buy monolithic mixing ph end end start one business process want address want start customer service want use u field service process service automation customer sale automation get going knowing fully well essentially future proof future expansion address application business process move forward kind different approach thinking marketplace also building top goodness azure capability service take advantage infused would think intelligence capability whether thing like essentially building model customer use product thing like inventory stockout alert able relationship helping customer sale automation depending regardless human judgment ability close deal actually say hey deal really going close based relationship help observed customer engagement system ross macmillanso think infusing business connecting business process across different area essentially letting customer start wherever want knowing fully well future proof expansion great conscious time coming end slot could probably go another half hour easily breakout across way takeshi thank much coming today appreciate
