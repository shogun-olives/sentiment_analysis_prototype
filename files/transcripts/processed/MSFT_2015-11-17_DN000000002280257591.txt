okay good morning everyone great morning going spend time morning talking perhaps one pressing issue time industry cyber security fact look history computing history information technology starting start started store data transmit data communicate always attack trust mail came mail fraud telegraph radio television came wire fraud internet cyber crime time faced come together collectively individual company organization government respond use technology able respond challenge cyber security today want talk microsoft contribution microsoft approach start talk cyber security want first start microsoft mission mission empower every person organization planet achieve drive technology innovation agenda interact customer show customer partner broader ecosystem drive everything trust core mission mission capture optimism future optimism digital technology play positive role every walk life every sector economy aspect life entertain commerce educate boy girl part economy retail healthcare energy using digital technology today drive innovation transform become core tech industry core every industry customer going use technology ca trust trust u central mission empowering every person organization taking principled approach strong commitment make sure customer trust digital technology use four pillar come privacy ensure data private control come compliance manage data accordance law land also transparent collection data us data lastly ensure data secure four strong commitment make everything product service work customer proactively reactively grounded four principle today want talk security cyber security fact year even 2015 tough year around cyber security top eight data breach led 160 million data record compromised fact one biggest challenge face time detect intrusion something like 229 day intruded versus know start respond cost term lost productivity lost growth really add estimated something like 3 trillion global economy challenged growth really huge issue u collectively question microsoft going responding challenge approach talk approach want start describing changing environment time could talk environment strong perimeter around could talk data application computing end point secure within four wall environment last two decade taken advantage connected world connected economy extended network touch customer directly could thing like customer relationship management customer directly electronically connected u optimized supply chain inventory level throughout supply chain constantly updating connectivity system stop stopped fact last couple year increased pace connectivity increasingly looking public cloud service infrastructure infrastructure service platform service increasingly turning saas application business application crm erp given pace change fact one thing also incorporating device owned employee inside network letting people bring phone computing end device environment course set even explode internet thing computing going ubiquitous going general purpose sensor going every room every conference room every living room therefore live world attack come anywhere attack vector come anywhere attacker lot sophisticated lot organized world world constantly evolving dynamic constant attack environment deal one thing drive u kind solution building talk today pretty unique perspective today run biggest internet service consumer side thing like xbox live well business commercial side service like oﬃce 365 dynamic azure give u pretty unique perspective happening great sampling happening term attack vector one responds example update window billion time month billion device upgraded month security patch compatibility make sure ecosystem remains vibrant run world largest antivirus service part window also inspect 200 million email part oﬃce 365 service malware looking attachment may malware associated take detonate inspect deliver inboxes people fact run gamut service spanning consumer commercial key think two aspect service reach consumer well service need able think intersection need able sampling traﬃc really help get visibility aspect something order 300 billion authentication every month see identity consumer business see network unique perspective helped u develop different security posture inside microsoft fact 14 year ago bill gate wrote trustworthy computing priority microsoft made tremendous amount progress changing environment longer code threat modeling testing fact operational security posture constantly evolving environment constantly attack environment operational security posture start like going gym every morning every hour day need prepared mean exercise operational security posture continuous basis framework protect detect respond u many year new posture example protect longer computing end point application computing end point application may inside premise cloud service using sensor hvac system datacenter infrastructure everything sensor datacenter part environment need protect come detection longer example waiting detect signature coming response deploying remediation moved much behavioral approach detect based behavior attack vector come response perhaps area going sea change term respond using transformation service base even window think window service ensure compatibility security window end point continuously oﬃce 365 service mean longer giving tool actually ensuring security data tenant service limited service run fact knowledge gain something share broadly industry customer going take u come together combat operational security posture perhaps biggest sea change inside microsoft get u come new solution new technology turn help u really secure environment approach taking three key element first building comprehensive platform able run loop protection detection response second complement intelligence fabric operational security posture well set proactive reactive service field help secure environment continuous basis lastly partnering broadly partnering rest industry know live isolation heterogeneous environment need operate within come platform one thing personally sit security review meeting every month look incident fact every time incident call ceo company issue ask two question help learn posture need take start operational security focus helped u ground real incidence real attack vector mobility attack vector response come want walk today built platform resilient attack accidental data loss perhaps one biggest issue especially bring service bring device unintended many julia whitecases devastating help get control plane allows avoid accidental data loss phishing attack social engineering perhaps one biggest source attack vector deal malware continues big issue getting much sophisticated term malware show computing end point email pas hash take access one account access others course even core hygiene sometimes take granted important start operational security posture recognize often issue deal lack patching lack strong credential important u improve technology security posture around basic security platform building across product felt great julia white come onstage give quick run capability platform julia thanks satya satya spoke different type security threat going show microsoft technology working partnership security ecosystem help address threat help achieve new security posture satya spoke going first start talking protection technology around identity theft certainly big area today user identity stolen misused unprecedented level solution frankly move away password completely point really choice smart card similar type technology unfortunately user experience cost complexity barrier broad adoption technology well window 10 passport addressed issue giving smart card level threat detection capability protection using device first factor authentication making simple simpler card second biometrics using window hello fingerprint facial iris clear front end password like device give actually password replacement big deal surface book set window hello facial recognition going step front happens fast watch quickly authenticates system using biometrics like incredibly simple user experience yet secure traditional password microsoft also working enable technology industry standard working fido alliance support company like amex intel able platform benefit type technology future certainly beyond hardware level identity protection also need secure manage identity around saas application increasingly using azure active directory come play enables single 2,500 saas application well let integrate existing application well enables conditional access enables let preconfigure apps require multifactor authentication determine based user app type even device health show look like go app portal excuse see bunch different saas apps use going go sale force set multifactor authentication going prompt phone call look see going get phone call phone right set preconfigured fashion get phone call going answer push pound key say acknowledge request press zero automatically report fraud organization directly logging phone going switch talking protecting identity moving protection malware know email continues primary place malware come organization satya mentioned scan 200 billion email month looking malware within oﬃce 365 course look known malware also looking unknown malware also known zero day attack hacker unfortunately discovers vulnerability patched course newer attack coming actually link email come legitimate updated fact become malicious technology increasingly important protect malware let go outlook experience email number different link one malicious updated fact going go ahead click show experience click satya spoke take link actually put detonation chamber conduct analysis behavioral analysis looking characteristic might make malicious thing like executable elevated privilege looking elevated privilege device see take user page let know protected important right employee know happened mean wo work around system take risky action well actually going call james demo support team get machine set virtual machine actually let switch let see okay great right moving email certainly security perspective going go ahead move threat vector course downloading apps web another vector malware come organization show different way certainly done bunch work within window 10 effectively generational step new technology called device guard long security around app control protect malware running running unauthorized application device attacker gotten sophisticated increasingly able bypass window 10 actually leveraged latest virtualization technology well partnering design level hardware stop hacker able run malware even gained admin level control machine big shift show comparison going look window 7 experience look window 10 experience device guard local virtual machine running side website malicious app trust actually malicious side system security showing going go ahead download app malware antivirus going detect get prompt going go ahead accept trust system unfortunately malware gained admin level privilege disabled firewall av solution unfortunately protected situation instead going move open window 10 virtual machine system show device guard protection scenario apps going download system security side let go ahead run experience accept device guard actually checking make sure digital signature valid also signed trusted authority like microsoft organization show blocked case protected malware thanks device guard speaking malware certainly need talk second pas hash familiar pas hash pas ticket unfortunately enables hacker go single compromised device able penetrate multiple device across environment window 10 literally ending pas hash new capability called credential guard realize big claim let explain work specifically window 10 first time using virtualization isolate critical window service authentication new architecture sensitive window process secured information well using credential defended hacker thus preventing pas hash attack big change making big leap around ending kind security threat talked lot protection identity perspective malware perspective let switch talk protection data loss also big area concern know people increasingly working mobile environment mean need secure way enable experience secure way intune microsoft mobile device management mobile application management solution part enterprise mobility suite protect data across device enabling bring device whatever policy might place intune us conditional access control ﬂow email corporate file going device based policy set unlike legacy mdm vendor might using require deploy cumbersome hardware type thing intune cloud service really ready support new security posture satya spoke show look like personal iphone want use work gone simple step enrolling device defined able device corporate data application like save information share information oﬃce device let share look like going go outlook experience email get work done many u enter pin managed secured app company outlook email star attachment want get work done go ahead open word approved organization use business purpose open maybe case want save personal dropbox account share would unauthorized way going try anyway maybe know better go ahead make copy choose dropbox account try save dropbox account see blocked approved method device control okay well turn savvy user committed try share information even though stopping instead going try copy information going go back try send email another way go back savvy actually going switch go personal email identity within outlook sending personal user trying create email go going try paste see paste option blocked using personal identity privilege work business data sophisticated enough go switch back work credential permission send information go back paste fact paste work even within application identity level decide appropriate work use protected sent wrong way wrong place great example keep rich oﬃce experience people love able use personally work still get right protection control perspective also number partner done integration similar type experience example adobe box sap provide level control application phone showed device enrolled device experience enrolled mobile device management also taking oﬃce outlook oﬃce app experience showed enabling without device enrollment get application management without device enrollment make easy bring device adoption perspective simple also mean run great oﬃce experience legacy mobile device management vendor might place already going show scenario time going show window 10 enterprise data protection capability get nice seamless user experience also get granular control well first walk show authenticate course using window hello let go another use biometrics let hold looking see better password secure similar experience window start screen see little icon corner application approved business use user see ok business use versus purely personal use making simple go file explorer see go even file level app level personal document well work document go ahead open work document similar showed iphone going go ahead try copy sensitive information let go case going try send unauthorized way time going use twitter see icon supposed using work purpose going try anyway go try paste see time actually get pretty nuanced message see exactly happening case policy set go ahead send going monitoring action course block completely fully configurable see window 10 nice user experience get nice rich message paste missing well granular control around want manage talked protection capability right around identity around malware around data loss let switch talk detection satya mentioned increasingly important know great protection thing like identity theft continue reality unfortunately specific case primary way hacker getting enabling breach need able tool monitor protect identity attack happens way essentially monitor capability learn normal authentication action identify abnormal anomalous happening combine known threat detect identity compromised attack taking place many little bit like get call credit card see abnormal behavior think something idea applied identity way learning normal behavior detect anomalous behavior front cloud get azure active directory filled right heard many customer want level control premise environment new microsoft advanced threat analytics capability come advanced analytics dashboard essentially give timeline view different threat might want consider understand essentially let know kind let get signal noise lot different authentication let start see bunch guess term looking user name someone trying guess user name organization go see using brute force attack get user name password figured user name michael dubinsky unfortunately strong password look like 450 guess secured password well go see moved yellow red really important high threat michael dubinsky user name password used sign number computer resource would normally trying access also number resource across company unusual user name password comparing normal activity learning able detect abnormal scroll see high alert around pas ticket attack taking place organization moment really love new window 10 credential guard stopping action case right new advanced threat analytics insight immediately go take action stop breach remember satya said number day attack happens sits network 200 day identify right away opportunity sit network time talked identify perspective around detection threat let also move infrastructure level talk detection respond level infrastructure infrastructure continues move cloud azure built comprehensive security system azure security center azure security center provides central view security setting across entire azure environment live monitoring security configuration make sure ongoing good security health analyzing security setting even change bringing back recommendation well guiding step ensure environment secure going take look azure security center click right see number recommendation suggesting based security posture go see thing action asking take case going choose adding web application firewall go see actually number web application firewall partner integrated right security center choose one like case going choose barracuda web application firewall go see actually right deploy solution azure environment significantly streamlines process provisioning partner solution well enables bring whatever preferred security vendor cloud simple way addition partner shown also working folk like trend micro cisco fortinet checkpoint well many come around malware well firewall recommendation great important also identifying security alert within azure environment well next go security alert see number thing showing go see different thing happening drill one within security center find going case see sql injection attempt made go virtual machine one luckily barracuda web application firewall deployed protecting attack fantastic let go see else going see traﬃc going virtual machine one malicious ip tapping intelligent security graph microsoft broad view malicious ip identify quickly proactively notify customer going within also giving recommendation remediate security situation well right go fix take insight move action great azure perspective cloud perspective also know customer running hybrid configuration meaning infrastructure premise private cloud well cloud maybe aws well azure course want kind security view across entire enterprise estate operation management suite come play powerful new solution collect massive amount machine data across datacenter well cloud brings together search correlate visualize massive amount data detect security threat across entire estate cloud well example could use operation management suite identify virtual machine datacenter communicating malicious ip notice azure look across entire organization find well shown example microsoft security technology working partnership security ecosystem across globe tapping satya nadellainto intelligent security graph help make customer safer turn back satya thanks thank much julie thank give good feel depth breadth technology building core product fact spend billion dollar r year building security mainstream product window 10 oﬃce 365 azure think security separate piece technology core operational system use data resides critical application usage fact built three product work well think something like conditional access build capability device build capability oﬃce 365 service thing like active directory also recognize u building technology together also need interoperate heterogeneous environment something first class deal identity deal device management deal data protection key design key building technology fact window 10 great technology julia showed device guard credential guard microsoft passport window hello core security technology fact virtualization infrastructure coupled make window 10 secure operating system last week big update window 10 also added management capability great performance combination performance management security make window 10 ready deployment enterprise situation organizational context excited window helping u move new frontier eﬃciency come security come azure two capability julia showed think critical one encapsulated inside enterprise mobility suite brought together new control plane brings identity management device management data protection together control plane becomes critical handling accidental data loss conditional data access conditional application access current world byod device well bring saas application em perhaps one strategic security product microsoft really help enhance security posture inside enterprise side course operation management suite around infrastructure limited infrastructure u azure true hybrid infrastructure manage security around virtual machine container irrespective estate premise azure cloud provider oﬃce 365 building security core product service advanced threat protection service give capability able detonate enclosure detonate attachment deliver inboxes lockbox give capability secure data encrypt data give key access required building rich technology core product refer platform second aspect approach intelligence aspect technology deliver platform technology coupled intelligence building intelligent security graph historically always something called digital crime unit worked law enforcement fighting cybercrime many issue vulnerable population child older people face come cybercrime worked many industry law enforcement fight even bringing together operational security people across company people running everything xbox live oﬃce 365 azure window update window defender bringing together one operation center call cyber defense operation center like intelligence operation silo actually people able real time connect dot happening across service operation center output operation center intelligence graph used turn product create security product share intelligence broadly customer partner fact stopping also putting resource right field cyber security specialist proactively reactively work customer using product well intelligence help secure environment said partnership key everything microsoft u working together ecosystem fact digital crime unit well cyber defense operation center use lot technology defend estate want interoperate tool want able take advantage one partner brings collectively secure environment new approach new platform new intelligence new partnership start new posture operational security
