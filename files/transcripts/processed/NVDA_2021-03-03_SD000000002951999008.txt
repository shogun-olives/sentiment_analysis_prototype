question answer maybe reported strong number obviously continue dealing pretty significant shortage maybe could start tight supply situation keep intensifying clearly demand really good particularly gaming space colette kress joseph moorebut given supply binding constraint revenue growth want understand kind issue need another fab cycle catch business better forecast absolute inability get wafer inability get substrate thing like need yes thanks joe joe going take also little stop make statement well keep mind throughout discussion today may discussing statement opportunity folk make sure read information supply sec make sure understand risk identified time let kind go back question talk supply honestly really talk supply really understand facing strong demand strong demand across portfolio really strong demand moved overall holiday season overall launch ampere architecture gaming working best continue improve supply expect supply excuse demand greater supply year channel inventory time lean overall gaming business one specific form inventory inventory component could call time really tied across board take different piece make sure provide overall demand demand high expect grow certainly based communicated term expectation first quarter certainly inventory employed dual foundry strategy work tsmc samsung really type overall computing really benefited u overall environment purchasing cycle contract use vendor supplier continues nature secure throughout time consistency amount pulling overall supplier overall operation team executing well expect supply increase consistently move year helpful maybe could talk big picture want get ampere specific success seeing colette kressbut general strength gaming guy think talked everyone gamer going increase population clearly really accelerated covid environment people limited term thing really seems conducive spending money gaming time seem like sustained increase people experiencing gaming weigh two factor think sustainability beyond year sort increase population gamers people buying hardware significant amount yes think step back really kind ass seeing term ampere ampere significant type growth seeing launch ampere architecture overall launched 3090 3080 3070 came extremely well received probably launch overall ampere overall gaming volume segment 3090 3080 3070 really showing probably 40 growth extremely strong 3060 desktop gpus launched discussed last week earnings essentially vaporized went launch continuing work supply additional 3060s market seeing excitement overall gaming gaming desktop laptop gpus model also launched back ce important driver seeing demand powerful upgrade cycle think important thing keep mind right le 15 probably 200 million overall installed base rtx essentially got 85 installed base still able upgrade experience overall ray tracing huge incentive therefore upgrade 2x overall performance improvement 2x power eﬃciency turing even comment term see term performance improvement pascal pascal two generation prior amazing performance improvement people want overall upgrade seen ray tracing also really industry standard nvidia one put term real ray tracing unique capability also include dl essentially using ai unique ray tracing without loss performance see three dozen game support overall ray tracing important game fortnite 1 battle royale game cyberpunk 2077 1 role playing keep mind even minecraft game support joseph moore colette kressso saw last couple quarter important quarter really fueled excitement around gaming probably way pulled term excitement see gamers entering market new become even bigger better social entertainment sport many working home correct believe gamers eventually start earlier start earlier process start process become gamer always gamer think something see continue moving forward people get excited ability play friend safe environment virtual environment whether home desktop mobile laptop move forward yes helpful yes started high end market ampere moved kind 3060 said mainstream seems pretty positive rest year really put large number sort without full ampere product portfolio certainly given older product shelf anymore seems like good backdrop talk little bit mentioned investment ray tracing little bit problem technology like know saw programmable shaders decade ago introduced hardware software come later seems like sweet spot generally seems like strong backdrop demand certainly beyond quarter said yes seen strong demand ampere high level card produced q4 gamers continuing enter market and/or refresh refer buying stack getting average overall card continues move generation per generation unit total remember 40 improvement really selling overall bringing overall mainstream 3060 gpus talked 30 overall series overall 60 class important area mainstream volume overall sku refer sweet spot visibility see provided overall guidance q1 believe strong overall gaming demand continues throughout year really fueled seeing term acceptance even day one also even market low channel inventory time also early stage full upgrade opportunity launched high end stack moving overall 3060 way go believe visibility excitement gaming excitement architecture fueling seeing term joseph moore colette kress joseph moorevisibility great couple gaming question one real growth driver guy really even predating ampere mobile gaming notebook gaming guy enabled new form factor pretty impressive gaming performance talk launched ampere mobile product ampere mobile space yes quite excited see adoption excitement gamers regarding laptop essentially created market performance laptop also mobility term thin light refer third generation term assisting oem manufacturer engineer term 50 size 50 weight 10x performance improvement time laptop right gaming laptop probably fastest growing gaming platform 7x seven year q4 example 12th consecutive quarter growth overall laptop rtx 30 series laptop launch one largest launch ever different device second generation ray tracing also extremely helpful gamers know also ray tracing laptop purchase overall desktop large upgrade opportunity well got 50 million geforce laptop gamers time 95 installed base performance might see term new console going forward 3060 series laptop 30 faster get ps5 important overall thing done additionally also open market creatives creative community independent community focus craft craft work catalog photo different thing 45 million creatives benefit ampere studio laptop also putting market see great opportunity improve rendering ampere laptop offer 5x improvement versus seen pascal lean overall channel inventory highly recommend laptop well great yes good color think maybe talk little bit cryptocurrency mining gave color call kind 100 million 300 million trailing revenue know guy taken action make sure gaming card end hand gamers extent cryptocurrency little bit disruptive guy past seems like gaming business lot bigger maybe put perspective colette kressfor u see 100 million 300 million going rest year specialty crypto product versus gaming yes let step back comment q4 saw q4 want make sure everybody understands ability see exactly overall card used unique way used cryptocurrency mining something able see privacy overall product continue term user using also ability create new us seeing term overall gpus given estimate estimate referring analyst marked term saw overall q4 result meaning access model good understanding concluded term range fact q4 revenue q1 guidance probably would exact number without crypto gaming demand well ahead available supply needed refill low level term channel inventory inventory became available term retail really took quite significant amount time uplift take time next couple quarter revenue would without crypto overall gaming business believe situation though crypto quite different seen previous cycle one large installed base large installed base produce hash rate level seeing today large installed base potential reactivate time additionally see asics market asics also address mining mining ethereum well start new architecture versus last time previous cycle tail end architecture moving transition therefore time channel inventory low strong demand gamers probably main contributor driving overall tight supply created overall cmp cmp stand crypto mining processor created professional miner start shipping march time frame put guidance q1 approximately 15 million cmp q1 though could indicated end quarter make sure articulate provide transparency much sold overall cmp board also opportunity u look 3060 launched make sure tailoring gaming reducing eﬃciency hashing mining overall 3060 essentially card best engineered overall gamers believe two piece put place crypto time allow u separate market best separate market gamers joseph moore colette kress joseph mooreseparate market overall miner great know gamers appreciate trying get card hand good hear maybe shifting hpc cloud number impressive growth driver obviously phenomenal run last several year talk generally driver business go piece yes experiencing right computing cloud part overall data center business far outpacing industry time nvidia growing time many others saw industry decline sequentially q4 saw also industry perspective discussed term q4 q1 also maybe approximately 20 seeing nvidia growth growth sequentially q3 q4 also anticipate growth q4 q1 important time even overall lockdown seen importance cloud importance computing ai solution important vital enterprise hyperscales many type company around seen q4 compute reached double digit growth better outlook anticipated well seeing strong growth term vertical industry vertical industry key area focus supercomputing financial service higher education well also consumer internet company give opportunity adopt overall cloud usage move solution well therefore solution may choose dgxs strong growth dgx strength csps higher education term well health care seeing term overall cloud presence cloud presence important area vertical industry start sometimes remain continue move build term hyperscales excited ampere really tried put ampere cloud fast really working qualification working nvidia term smooth overall movement cloud new overall architecture actually seen last couple quarter know room grow term hyperscale term expanding cloud great helpful think thinking compute part hard predict sort look big wave investment saw couple year ago around really computer vision deep learning supplied vision application colette kressnow looking natural language model million time number parameter saw vision model mean sort demonstrable increase complexity application set seems increase seems like lot growth potential business adoption probably little year ago google started saying bert transformer kind important element business term deep learning applied natural language recommendation thing like seems like still relatively early stage yes early stage definitely term growth ai comment often say look back look back time thought knew lot ai knew lot solution learn truly truly early day important thing grown last couple year refer model refer bert understanding leverage overall ai improve conversational ai natural language processing talk natural language processing really fueling use voice use voice translation term multiple language use voice translate speech word word back term overall speech many different use case occur seeing term hyperscales focused search also know enterprise see improvement opportunity call center support center use ai better serve service overall customer model though quite quite complex quite complex see growing see doubling every month 30,000x five year seen overall model complexity one big thing natural language processing added also seeing surge overall recommendator engine recommendator engine important overall hyperscales see consumer internet company also understanding importance drawing folk site consumer realize overall service drive model complexity also drive overall inference inference major driver part cloud time seeing adoption a100 form factor remind a100 quite unique term built system overall hyperscales enterprise system accomplish training model also used inferencing give overall ﬂexibility universal use support computing support overall ai support many different form ai training overall inferencing really fueled simplistic ability purchase deploy ﬂexibility change joseph moore colette kressoverall ownership big wave business improvement seen early day ai great five minute take one question webcast question probably asked quite frequently competition hyperscale solution like google tpu think amazon premium pose threat nvidia market share yes always discussion custom asics build shift come built unique nvidia approaching market support full system perspective focused chip see think chip think system think software future solution supporting allows u provide whole complete solution whatever may need today need going forward using together supporting overall cuda supporting overall development overall developer big thing cuda already v11 important continued growth seeing already 2.3 million developer platform 6 million cuda downloads last year important thing people continue turn towards nvidia give full stack order whether starting application continued work provided many overall sdks offered continue option jump overall cuda design write think work term mlperf really shown overall performance continues best performance better 7x ai 2x term traditional hpc versus lot overall competition performance continues bring people u performance mlperf continues important benchmark people use choose time time may workload static commodity may choose custom asic talked early stage ai u many decade come really continuing move platform evolving time innovation going key support market joseph moore colette kress joseph moore colette kress joseph moore great think wrap one final question automotive business maybe could talk mercedes deal announced second half last year kind timeframe maybe economics deal seems like revenue sharing take place beyond hardware sale excited deal mercedes really transformational deal u industry whole believe lot people looking deal overall structured providing mercedes full technology stack expanding data center data center infrastructure development well car ai car upgradable life vehicle see right mercedes sell probably 2 million car year let take example assume probably 10,000 per car software sold autonomous type car kind similar see market overall tesla opportunity revenue split nvidia mercedes software u outside also purchase term actual hardware sit inside mercedes car large dollar opportunity u deal exclusive strike similar deal others industry built design win pipeline drive probably inﬂection revenue next couple year okay great well unfortunately time get question great overview thank much time today good luck thanks joe u appreciate thank
