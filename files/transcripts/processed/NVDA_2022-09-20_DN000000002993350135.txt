hi everyone welcome gtc simona jankowski head investor relation nvidia hope chance view gtc news fact keynote morning also published several press release vlogs detailing today announcement next hour opportunity unpack discus today news ceo jensen huang cfo colette kress open q session financial analyst begin let quickly cover safe harbor statement today discussion may make statement based current expectation subject number significant risk uncertainty actual result may differ materially discussion factor could affect future financial result business please refer recent form report may file form security exchange commission statement made today based information currently available u except required law assume obligation update statement simona jankowski q toshiya hari simona jankowski q toshiya hari jensen huangquestions answer would like welcome q session jensen colette taking question zoom think familiar interface quick reminder please use raise hand feature zoom like ask question unmute called upon let pause moment review queue approach first question first question come toshiya hari goldman sachs please go ahead hi hear okay yes okay great jensen first thank much keynote probably wanted another 10 time fully digest everything announced omniverse seems like customer engagement broadened significantly since provided u update last time remind u thinking contribution p l realize relatively nascent strategy guy think analyst think contribution revenue growth profitability going forward yeah thanks toshiya three component omniverse platform first component simulation platform called ovx omniverse computer ovx first generation prototype volume scale based second generation powered ada l40s without belaboring reason term performance giant leap ampere saw keynote based rendering performance really incredible full production ramping trying get ovx computer customer fast quite large number customer signed receive ovx computer second component omniverse application built top application span entire range design build operate inside company designing car designing factory designing product way manufacturing operating omniverse involved believe omniverse one first simona jankowski q timothy arcuri simona jankowski jensen huang q timothy arcurienterprise application next web browser next web application span practically every organization fact showed example design involved marketing involved product configuration involved manufacturing involved simulation operation well every single organization opportunity engage omniverse work single source truth second application typically user third application new type database called omniverse nucleus put cloud going host managed service think nucleus database new type database interactive shared pull bring data three dimensional data metadata whatever behavior data physic data relationship data supplier data component go supplier et cetera bring data associated product building could inaudible could jt file characterizes 3d geometry could erp system associate vendor go component bring data nucleus nucleus shared people use active distributed database 3d world first large scale usd database business model probably like cloud database business model people connected storage component associated used component associated nuclear think cloud database announced today omniverse cloud would hosted cloud omniverse cloud basically database process pricing associated one case system part well understood case pricing application service process fine tuning case nucleus database cloud process fine tuning well sense conventional compared like thing described thank next question tim arcuri ubs thanks lot hear yes yes tim colette kress jensen huangperfect awesome jensen think big theme really new infrastructure service offering bionemo omniverse cloud guess two question first maybe colette update u think said back march think said 100 million year revenue run rate gave recurring software service revenue first question give u update second jensen sort curious business model stuff going offer instance aws cloud ultimately seems like maybe offer cloud seems like maybe sort inï¬‚ection look like csp hyperscaler thanks lot tim thanks question let first start first part question talked earlier already run rate software service provide number couple 100 million going continue grow great new offering even today also offering working time well move jensen talk little bit yeah remember accelerated computing full stack computing approach method using brute force transistor advance moore law largely ran course going forward opportunity continuing variety price performance curve moore law ended wanted able larger scale computing cost effective way 15 year almost 20 year pursuing already computing think broadly almost conventional wisdom accelerated computing really path forward opportunity u stay moore law go much turbocharged accelerated computing law artificial intelligence course benefited molecular dynamic benefited weather climate simulation going benefit many different thing different field ray tracing nvidia business core business computer graphic benefited tremendously first part full stack challenge architecture available every cloud partnership cloud vendor csps really two part internal consumption part using nvidia accelerated computing stack accelerate workload could recommender system could speech ai could large scale query course emergence large language model question important ai model decade important ai application decade internal consumption external consumption public cloud nvidia partner maybe even extended sale marketing force csps ecosystem evangelism platform software simona jankowski q w illiam stein jensen huangdevelopers startup 12,000 13,000 startup work built nvidia company using nvidia accelerated computing go cloud essentially business attractor significant part public cloud service going continue several area believe might able simplify democratize reach nvidia accelerated platform fairly complicated put system together couple public cloud two area associated large language model announced today nvidia managed service managed service would basically think ai training domain specific ai training designed super good large language model effort cost training nvidia service running cloud run initially going run service cloud use service could substantially reduce cost training large language model training called prompt tune large language model specific application second thing omniverse requires giant amount engineering working year bring omniverse cloud currently running aws goal run cloud partnership csps benefit opportunity attract customer using omniverse couple different area large language model per se looking english well language also chemistry biology also omniverse platform complicated thought would stand nvidia managed service make lot easier cost effective people use probably lot going forward especially area hard thank next question come stein truist great thank taking question add thanks incredible announcement made today maybe little bit confusing u many quite technical jensen made one curious think related autonomous driving transitioning inaudible thor detail condition led decision maybe also remind u progress big customer announcement year ago think talked adopting technology maybe remind u similar relationship built level oems might missed thank yeah thanks lot roll backwards ship first car 2025 late also announced jlr brand jlr entire ï¬‚eet brand going also powered nvidia full stack simona jankowski q aaron rakers jensen huang q aaron rakersshortly 2025 pushing forward also orin designed 40 different car company mention medical instrument iot edge ai server robotics kind orin chip car stack really phenomenal homerun started ramping couple quarter ago going ramping quite fast going forward think something like 11 billion pipeline next several year associated orin system associated within software associated reason decided change atlin ph next generation orin brand new architecture three processor inside robotics processor one gpu one cpu one tensor core three processor made enormous leap last two year made hard decision swarm put three new technology rather waiting another two year robotic system cycle time two year every two year announced major leap want miss atlin previous version based next generation orin missed decided bite bullet really hunker work hard much u could bear waiting another two year mean kind simple fact project project heart love love building incredibly hard work lot imagination go lot passion hard work go could imagine waiting another two year get hopper grace ada decided reason probably probably could say 60 passion could bear bringing technology world 40 hard work lot hard work passion overcame hard work thank jensen next question come aaron rakers well fargo yeah thank hear yes aaron nice hear thank thanks call want go talked today hopper full production account like guess maybe first question confirm pace hopper ran ph largely anticipated given question around china export jensen huangsituation second question think hopper product cycle think breadth platform strategy nvidia built think pricing strategy hopper relative ampere opportunity continue take bigger piece data center footprint hopper materializes likely next several quarter yeah first hopper five time throughput ph new type engine called transformer engine transformer important model today really largely replaced inaudible lcm surely also replace lot computer algorithm 5x speed 5x increase throughput 3x increase reduction excuse 3x reduction total cost ownership reason inside data center aside hopper chip know look hopper system entire system built disassembled took complex part called hopper hgx board eight hopper ten thousand component insanely complex ship whole thing hopper inaudible system go data center data center includes cable networking switch power supply storage forth power delivery infrastructure forth 5x throughput three time lower tco implies hopper price higher ampere think value proposition fantastic net reduces cost compared last generation substantially mentioned let see ramp full production ship quantity quarter ship quantity next quarter signal csps oems enterprise really solid reason one primary driver ampere benefit ramp hopper benefit brand new revolutionary new model called transformer probably looking seeing web impact unreasonable performance large language model able learn new skill shot learning example learning secondarily ability generate image number application coming industry really quite incredible benefit time almost industrial wide recognition large language model democratized ai made easy almost anybody use ai hopper really going advance large language model democratize application inference cost much lower mention one vibrant industry moment probably incredibly well funded segment world startup digital biology watching industry probably recognize digital biology went revolution cost gene sequencing breakthrough predicting structure protein structure chemistry able understand language biology chemistry turbocharged drug discovery segment therapeutic segment pricing lot go remains really really vibrant anyways hopper going revolutionary application simona jankowski q c.j muse jensen huang next question come c.j muse evercore please go ahead good morning thank taking question congrats formal launch ada lovelace front would love stick gaming jensen third generation ray tracing talk competitive landscape guess maybe bigger picture considering kind inventory correction going speak kind anticipated ramp timing 4090 4080 perhaps thinking 4070 mainstream coming online thanks much yeah took action last quarter quarter prepare channel great launch know substantially reduced selling ampere allow channel normalize market end market soft soft would allow u opportunity sell excess inventory channel took specific action marketing program particularly reduce segment ada going initially typically ada different typically ramp top enthusiast would like see brand new product customer refresh frequently every couple year would like see new product also segment need ramp omniverse omniverse workstation omniverse server forth sensible place u ramp first ramp ada nicely starting little bit quarter largely next quarter robustly going leaving year going next year current execution plan really good place moment mentioned asked competition let see think fairly well known quite far ahead ray tracing rtx two thing three thing guess first programmable shading invented 20 year ago 20 somewhat year ago augmented programmable shading rtx two new processor one hardware ray tracing processor third generation second tensor core ai processor guess fifth generation ai work necessary neural rendering neural graphic infusing artificial intelligence ray tracing programmable shading mile ahead saw keynote today keep mind everything rendered everything rendered real time oï¬ „ ine rendering like movie computer graphic simulation able see something like ph oï¬ „ ine rendering everything baking video game today able really quite unbelievable think ada giant quantum leap forward bigger leap look performance power eï¬ƒciency every aspect bigger leap ampere ampere simona jankowski q vivek arya colette kress jensen huangturing kind tell something third generation get lot thing right pulled lot thing together next question come vivek arya bank america great thank much jensen colette keynote opportunity ask question wanted clarify jensen based comment made gaming 2.5 billion still kind right run rate end demand understand shipping wanted clarify still reasonable number use actual end demand gaming product question hopper grace cpu nvidia ambition planning kind focus hpc segment see chance take across entire 30 billion right time server cpu ambition kind narrower technology issue cost issue right supply issue like prevents nvidia going entire 30 billion tam ph server cpu let see start jensen kind clarify inaudible 2.5 billion demand gaming earnings release discussed looking normalized demand gaming given planning shipping quarter looking q2 q3 combined believe underlying demand approximately valued 5 billion yes split two quarter seasonality sometimes outplays quarter approximately 2.5 billion plus minus wanted make sure background call grace hopper highlighted particular problem giant scale probably valuable software world today ago window important software valuable software could argue decade later page rank one valuable piece software planet recommender system drive vast majority world buy everything put front small screen trillion thing could selected recommended ranked u recommender system amount data could imagine enormous many recommender system one recommender system almost everything pop ad put product put price rank movie book front blog short form video long form video everything put front came recommender system simona jankowski q stacy rasgon simona jankowski jensen huang q stacy rasgonevery single company recently recommender system investment banker product service improved result significantly pleased product service offer future almost every website vibrant recommender system making one hand much much easier scale using sdk call merlin hand making lot easier people engage chose recommender system represents today ai factory almost every one large data center running 24x7 constantly recommending something constantly collecting new data go refine recommender chose probably one application simultaneously large scale also different computing profile everything done far ai used way feature uniqueness grace hopper whole bunch example like spark leading data analytics engine world used probably 80 world enterprise popular data analytics platform cloud going grace hopper going ideal going use large data scientific computing selected fact gave example probably valuable enterprise application going really great cloud computing energy density high could put lot cpu rack energy eï¬ƒciency great lot different use case chose highlight make grace special even one example grace hopper probably seven time performance hopper powerful computer world today fact create architecture much big leap forward particular application thought worthy highlight next question come stacy rasgon bernstein please go ahead hi guy thanks taking question hear yeah yes stacy good great thank wanted ask view supply availability ada launch given happened ampere lunch importantly gauging demand ada environment like obviously channel ï¬‚ushing people worried gpus formerly used crypto mining getting dumped market mean given noise jensen huang simona jankowski q matthew ramsay jensen huang q matthew ramsaydo gauge demand product guess supply demand mean asking well best work delayed think fairly broadly known delayed launch ada give channel opportunity clear 3080 3090s 3080 ti 3090 ti basically segment gave u opportunity work partner put marketing program place move pricing segment even ada come would still really good value anybody bought prepared two quarter pretty harsh medicine order prepare ada ada going come segment going well anything going affected crypto reaction referring stacy think look 4080 going come target large segment gpus enthusiast core gamers tend affected market condition expect ada launch successful believe prepared cell channel welcome ada open arm stay clear follow dynamic mentioned great launch next question come matt ramsay cowen please go ahead thank much good morning team guy hear okay yes matt awesome thanks letting ask question thanks information today jensen think lot u still trying get head around restriction came china intention government also ramification secondary tertiary announced question around thing guy announced today software side whether geforce gaming drive auto business obviously omniverse stuff across enterprise see environment software opportunity china restriction hardware shipped china accelerate opportunity software chinese customer host compute data fear might restriction software business china honestly clue sort risk award analysis software business thought would really appreciated thank jensen huang sure restriction specific restriction specific requires license specific level compute combined specific level connection bandwidth within restriction offer customer plenty choice alternative product within envelope requires restricted restriction customer requires specific product seek license think u.s. government would like know world using product nature customer alternative product going fine working hard working fast offer customer alternative product expectation outside proper execution team working really hard able offer customer would accept alternative product excellent regarding software incremental relationship restriction reason heard say accelerated computing full stack ca go compiler c++ compiler c compiler compiler software run really nicely gpu way work reason cpu designed compliable designed forgiving bad code designed single threaded way software easy write gpus designed way instead one two four thread execution inside gpu could 15,000 25,000 thread execution 25,000 thing running around 20,000 thing running around hard human keep track created programming language programming model whole bunch library top whole bunch algorithm runtime engine sits top call platform platform whenever announced new software tell deduct new software specific purpose 300 sdks question select one selected reason mostly one several vector one new application field important think know developer know scientist know ecosystem know like example first time able take valuable probably recent modern valuable database called graph database formulated sample deep learning use deep learning learn predictive pattern graph called cugraph spoke last time spoke around time want speak next time radical importance many different industry might spoken operational research work cuopt work large language model work quantum computing thing expand market second reason tell highlight sdks help understand accelerated computing going new market market well beyond deep learning maybe enabled deep learning case graph library spoke highlight importance new use operator q mark lipacis jensen huangcase new market new breakthrough lot way best way look nvidia business growth look sdks reason accelerated computing full stack thing new software new consumer new demand hardware always software hardware way around next question come mark lipacis jefferies hi thanks taking question thanks great presentation jensen used expression full stack computing lot think lot go behind description guy delivering talk transformed nvidia like mean internally company kind become full stack computing company compare today accelerating computing era model fair say accelerating computing like microsoft intel pc fair analogy underselling guy delivering could kind put perspective guy really delivering relative previous computing area think would interesting thank yeah mark great question pc industry actually unique industry created horizontal business model notice cloud computing horizontal cloud computing fact vertical cloud service provider platform saas paas database service sort dbaas iaa know lot service could think accelerated computing basically way order successful accelerated computing much people used aggregated one vertically integrated company vertically field computing vertically integrated going successful nobody going write operating system nobody going write runtime engine nobody going develop even distributed operating system whether cloud supercomputing enterprise nobody going write really go choice storage company networking company storage networking cybersecurity world public cloud interacts accelerated computing data center scale network storage cybersecurity really part computing fabric choice building chip none customer buy chip need ultimately might place po whole bunch chip really buying nvidia computing stack explains reason broadly used many different cloud simona jankowski q harlan sur jensen huang q harlan surand computer maker forth stack wherever happen using promise going delivers speed well beyond reason well beyond cost adding many order many factor anyways full stack computing problem talk basically four stack mark first stack nvidia put together graphic stack today called nvidia rtx computer graphic full stack problem design develop artificial intelligence physic engine ray tracing engine software nobody going part opengl exist build full stack people ca use platform second nvidia hpc scientific computing stack quantum chemistry molecular dynamic forth ï¬‚uid dynamic forth third nvidia ai run time engine nvidia ai essentially operating system modern

accelerating customer time market large language model training 2 million deployment monetization model subscription based consumption based also noticed l40 announcement going ovx platform expect launch rest l series proviz line gpus solution jensen huang simona jankowski q rajvindra gill jensen huang colette kress take second one first announced rtx 6000 complement ampere workstation lineup typical rhythm desktop first couple quarter later maybe le time notebook thin light thing come shortly could expect basic rhythm case l40 question version well would want ruin surprise l40 really quite perfect one launch time customer really clamoring omniverse computer got working oems world getting inaudible shipped enterprise business model nvidia managed cloud service going consumption example case nemo large language model made much much easier learn prompt associated adapting language model application everything stood likely model similar cloud service provider per gpu hour except would per gpu hour net added price still see much much lower cost minimum much effective much easier way train model let see think spot right omniverse going consumption model well training large language model training next question come raji gill needham please go ahead yes thank taking question thank keynote well quick question near term appreciate fact shipping gaming demand quite large amount order clear excess inventory channel prepare next generation gaming architecture also indicated 5 billion kind run rate combine two quarter would imply pretty good visibility still end market demand wondering overall end market demand roughly gaming market tied china europe statistic correct economy weakening fairly significantly know china pushing stimulus plan question really visibility end market demand level confidence appreciate taking large inventory correction think make lot sense insight would super helpful thank want take happy either way start say inaudible quite accurate got good amount business around world region almost divide jensen huang simona jankowski q joseph moore jensen huang simona jankowski jensen huangregions seeing dealing different macro condition right underlying ability game form gaming attainment still driving solid term product underselling bright time produce ada going forward watch carefully still seeing solid demand see thing change going forward possibly right look solid move jensen see anything add thought perfect okay think time one last question come joe moore morgan stanley please go ahead great thank thanks presentation wonder could talk pricing gaming business noticed 4080 come higher price materially higher 3080 know suggested retail price 3080 never really achieved always talk generally think cost inï¬‚ation affecting guy full stack extent know provide value generation price generally drifting cycle going fairly normal general inï¬‚ation going drive price higher normal well first value proposition ada chart never generational leap great new architecture fundamentally advanced three processor breakthrough neural rendering chart really unlike anything ever possible value incredible adoption platform across world game developer incredible ada going come going incredible value incredible pricing higher last generation would say comparable gross margin u comparable last generation kind frame think important thing price point value gamers going get new ada graphic card going chart thank jensen think time question today closing comment like make get air well let covered lot
