hi everyone welcome gtc simona jankowski head investor relation nvidia hope chance view gtc news fact keynote morning also published several press release vlogs detailing today announcement next hour opportunity unpack discus today news ceo jensen huang cfo colette kress open q session financial analyst begin let quickly cover safe harbor statement today discussion may make statement based current expectation subject number significant risk uncertainty actual result may differ materially discussion factor could affect future financial result business please refer recent form report may file form security exchange commission statement made today based information currently available u except required law assume obligation update statement simona jankowski q toshiya hari simona jankowski q toshiya hari jensen huangquestions answer would like welcome q session jensen colette taking question zoom think familiar interface quick reminder please use raise hand feature zoom like ask question unmute called upon let pause moment review queue approach first question first question come toshiya hari goldman sachs please go ahead hi hear okay yes okay great jensen first thank much keynote probably wanted another 10 time fully digest everything announced omniverse seems like customer engagement broadened significantly since provided u update last time remind u thinking contribution p l realize relatively nascent strategy guy think analyst think contribution revenue growth profitability going forward yeah thanks toshiya three component omniverse platform first component simulation platform called ovx omniverse computer ovx first generation prototype volume scale based second generation powered ada l40s without belaboring reason term performance giant leap ampere saw keynote based rendering performance really incredible full production ramping trying get ovx computer customer fast quite large number customer signed receive ovx computer second component omniverse application built top application span entire range design build operate inside company designing car designing factory designing product way manufacturing operating omniverse involved believe omniverse one first simona jankowski q timothy arcuri simona jankowski jensen huang q timothy arcurienterprise application next web browser next web application span practically every organization fact showed example design involved marketing involved product configuration involved manufacturing involved simulation operation well every single organization opportunity engage omniverse work single source truth second application typically user third application new type database called omniverse nucleus put cloud going host managed service think nucleus database new type database interactive shared pull bring data three dimensional data metadata whatever behavior data physic data relationship data supplier data component go supplier et cetera bring data associated product building could inaudible could jt file characterizes 3d geometry could erp system associate vendor go component bring data nucleus nucleus shared people use active distributed database 3d world first large scale usd database business model probably like cloud database business model people connected storage component associated used component associated nuclear think cloud database announced today omniverse cloud would hosted cloud omniverse cloud basically database process pricing associated one case system part well understood case pricing application service process fine tuning case nucleus database cloud process fine tuning well sense conventional compared like thing described thank next question tim arcuri ubs thanks lot hear yes yes tim colette kress jensen huangperfect awesome jensen think big theme really new infrastructure service offering bionemo omniverse cloud guess two question first maybe colette update u think said back march think said 100 million year revenue run rate gave recurring software service revenue first question give u update second jensen sort curious business model stuff going offer instance aws cloud ultimately seems like maybe offer cloud seems like maybe sort inﬂection look like csp hyperscaler thanks lot tim thanks question let first start first part question talked earlier already run rate software service provide number couple 100 million going continue grow great new offering even today also offering working time well move jensen talk little bit yeah remember accelerated computing full stack computing approach method using brute force transistor advance moore law largely ran course going forward opportunity continuing variety price performance curve moore law ended wanted able larger scale computing cost effective way 15 year almost 20 year pursuing already computing think broadly almost conventional wisdom accelerated computing really path forward opportunity u stay moore law go much turbocharged accelerated computing law artificial intelligence course benefited molecular dynamic benefited weather climate simulation going benefit many different thing different field ray tracing nvidia business core business computer graphic benefited tremendously first part full stack challenge architecture available every cloud partnership cloud vendor csps really two part internal consumption part using nvidia accelerated computing stack accelerate workload could recommender system could speech ai could large scale query course emergence large language model question important ai model decade important ai application decade internal consumption external consumption public cloud nvidia partner maybe even extended sale marketing force csps ecosystem evangelism platform software simona jankowski q w illiam stein jensen huangdevelopers startup 12,000 13,000 startup work built nvidia company using nvidia accelerated computing go cloud essentially business attractor significant part public cloud service going continue several area believe might able simplify democratize reach nvidia accelerated platform fairly complicated put system together couple public cloud two area associated large language model announced today nvidia managed service managed service would basically think ai training domain specific ai training designed super good large language model effort cost training nvidia service running cloud run initially going run service cloud use service could substantially reduce cost training large language model training called prompt tune large language model specific application second thing omniverse requires giant amount engineering working year bring omniverse cloud currently running aws goal run cloud partnership csps benefit opportunity attract customer using omniverse couple different area large language model per se looking english well language also chemistry biology also omniverse platform complicated thought would stand nvidia managed service make lot easier cost effective people use probably lot going forward especially area hard thank next question come stein truist great thank taking question add thanks incredible announcement made today maybe little bit confusing u many quite technical jensen made one curious think related autonomous driving transitioning inaudible thor detail condition led decision maybe also remind u progress big customer announcement year ago think talked adopting technology maybe remind u similar relationship built level oems might missed thank yeah thanks lot roll backwards ship first car 2025 late also announced jlr brand jlr entire ﬂeet brand going also powered nvidia full stack simona jankowski q aaron rakers jensen huang q aaron rakersshortly 2025 pushing forward also orin designed 40 different car company mention medical instrument iot edge ai server robotics kind orin chip car stack really phenomenal homerun started ramping couple quarter ago going ramping quite fast going forward think something like 11 billion pipeline next several year associated orin system associated within software associated reason decided change atlin ph next generation orin brand new architecture three processor inside robotics processor one gpu one cpu one tensor core three processor made enormous leap last two year made hard decision swarm put three new technology rather waiting another two year robotic system cycle time two year every two year announced major leap want miss atlin previous version based next generation orin missed decided bite bullet really hunker work hard much u could bear waiting another two year mean kind simple fact project project heart love love building incredibly hard work lot imagination go lot passion hard work go could imagine waiting another two year get hopper grace ada decided reason probably probably could say 60 passion could bear bringing technology world 40 hard work lot hard work passion overcame hard work thank jensen next question come aaron rakers well fargo yeah thank hear yes aaron nice hear thank thanks call want go talked today hopper full production account like guess maybe first question confirm pace hopper ran ph largely anticipated given question around china export
