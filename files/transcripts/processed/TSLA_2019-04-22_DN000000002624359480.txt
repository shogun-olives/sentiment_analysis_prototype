going introduce pete martin done best chip system architect know world honor team tesla take away tell incredible work team done thanks elon pleasure morning real treat really tell work colleague tesla last three year think tell little bit whole thing got started introduce full computer tell little bit work dive chip go detail describe custom neural network accelerator designed work show result hopefully still awake hired february 2016 asked elon willing spend money take full custom system design said well going win said well yeah course said got u started hired bunch people started thinking full custom designed chip full autonomy would look like spent 18 month design august 2017 released design manufacturing got back december powered actually worked well first try made change released rev april 2018 july 2018 chip qualified started full production production quality part december 2018 autonomous driving stack running new hardware able start retrofitting employee car testing hardware software real world last march started shipping new computer model x earlier april started production model 3 whole program hiring first employee full production three car little three year probably fastest system development program ever associated really speaks lot advantage tremendous amount vertical integration allow concurrent engineering speed deployment term goal totally focused exclusively tesla requirement make life lot easier one one customer worry anything else one goal keep power 100 watt could retrofit new machine existing car also wanted lower park cost could enable full redundancy safety time thumb wind estimate would take least 50 trillion operation second neural network performance drive car wanted get least much really much possibly could batch size many item operate time example google batch size 256 wait around 256 thing process get started want designed machine batch size one soon image show process immediately minimize latency maximises safety needed gpu run time quite lot speculated time amount gpu would decline neural network got better better actually come pas took risk putting fairly modest gpu design see turned good bet security secure car ca safe car lot focus security course safety term actually chip design elon alluded earlier really neural network accelerator existence 2016 everybody adding instruction cpu gpu dsp make better inference nobody really natively set component chip purchased industry standard ip cpu gpus allowed u minimize design time also risk program another thing little unexpected first arrived

case light march nine example want get slam lidar pretty clear like lidar lidar lame lidar lame like case point 99999 road actually lidar may helpful sort redundancy backup first question second still focus computer vision redundant second question unidentified speaker q unidentified participant unidentified speaker q unidentified participanttrue happens rest industry building autonomy solution lidar going dump lidar prediction mark word point actually super hate lidar much may sound spacex spacex dragon us lidar navigate space station dock spacex developed lidar scratch spearheaded effort personally scenario lidar make sense car freaking stupid expensive unnecessary andrej saying saw vision worthless expensive hardware worthless car forward radar low cost helpful especially occlusion situation like fog dust snow radar see gon na use active photon generation use visible wavelength passive optical taken care visible wavelength stuff want use wavelength occlusion penetrating like radar lidar active photon generation visual spectrum active photon generation outside visual spectrum radar spectrum like 3.8 millimeter versus 400 nanometer 700 nanometer going much better occlusion penetration forward radar also 12 ultrasonics information addition eight camera forward radar radar forward direction direction going real fast gone multiple time like always show right size sweet add anything hi right mentioned asked ﬂeet information looking vision two question sound like car computation determine kind information send back correct assumption real time based stored information yes absolutely computation real time car wait basically specify condition interested car computation send data o  ine want computation car based question sound like guy really good position currently half million car future potentially million car essentially computer representing free almost free data center computational huge future opportunity tesla unidentified speaker q unidentified participant unidentified speaker q unidentified participant unidentified speaker q unidentified participant unidentified speaker q matt joyce elon r. muskit current current opportunity really factored anything yet incredible thank 425,000 car hardware tuned beyond mean got eight camera right rador ultrasonics got least video computer enough essentially figure information important compress information important salient element upload network training massive compression real world data sort network million computer like massive data center essentially distributed data center computational capacity see used thing besides future suppose could possibly used something besides focused get really nailed maybe going use million ten million computer hardware three four computer yeah maybe would technical diﬃculty could could like sort aws angle possible hello hi elon matt joyce loup venture model 3 minnesota snow lot since camera radar see road marking snow technical strategy solve challenge involve high precision gps actually like today actually autopilot decent job snow even lane marking covered even lane marking faded covered lot rain still seem drive relatively well specifically go snow yet data engine actually think completely tractable unidentified speaker q unidentified participant unidentified speakerbecause lot image even thing snowy ask human annotator lane line actually could tell actually relatively consistent inaudible lane line long annotator consistent data network pick pattern fine really signal even human annotator answer yes know fine yeah actually number important signal andrej saying lane line one thing one important signal drive space drivable space drivable space actually really matter drivable space lane line prediction drivable space extremely good think especially upcoming winter incredible like like could possibly good crazy thing point maybe even human annotator long human drive environment ﬂeet learning actually know path took obviously use vision guide path use lane line marking used entire geometry entire scene see see road roughly curling see car positioned around network pick pattern automatically inside enough data people traversing environment actually extremely important thing rigidly tied gps gps era vary quite bit actual situation road vary quite bit could reconstruction could detour car using gps primary real bad situation asking trouble fine use gps like tip trick like drive home neighborhood better neighborhood enough like country part country know neighborhood well use kind like knowledge neighborhood drive confidence maybe counterintuitive shortcut kind thing gps overlay data helpful never primary ever primary problem question back back corner wanted partially several competitor space past year made talked augmenting perception path planning capability kind car platform high definition map area driving play role system see adding value area would like get data collected ﬂeet kind mapping style data q unidentified participant unidentified speaker q unidentified participant unidentified speakeri think high precision high type high precision gps map lane really bad idea system becomes extremely brittle change like might change system make ca adapt lock onto gps high precision lane line allow vision override fact vision thing everything like lane line guideline main thing brieﬂy barked tree high precision lane line realized huge mistake reversed good helpful understanding annotation object car drive negotiation aspect parking roundabout thing car road art science pretty good actually like cut stuff really well yeah inaudible using lot machine learning right term predicting kind creating explicit representation road look like explicit planner controller top representation lot heuristic traverse negotiate long tail like visual environment look like long tail negotiation game chicken play people think lot confidence eventually must kind ﬂeet learning component actually writing rule hand going going quickly plateau think yeah dealt issue like allow gradually aggressive behavior part user dial setting say aggressive le aggressive drive easy chill mode aggressive incredible progress phenomenal two question first term platooning think system geared somebody asked snow road platooning feature follow car front system system capable two ups asked platooning think like could absolutely build feature use train network example imitating human human already like follow car ahead neural network actually incorporates pattern internally figure correlation way car ahead face path going take done internally net concerned getting enough data tricky data neural network q unidentified participant unidentified speaker q unidentified participanttraining process actually quite magical stuff automatically turn different problem one problem collect data set using lot train three step feature complete future complete agree think person car need pay attention reliability level also convince regulator true kind like three level expect set feature complete year expect confident enough standpoint say think people need touch wheel look window sometime probably around know second quarter next year start expect get regulatory approval least jurisdiction towards end next year roughly timeline expect thing go probably truck tuning approved regulator anything else like maybe long haul long haul freight one driver front four semi trailing behind platooning manner think probably regulator would quicker approve thing regarding course convince u lidar technology opinion answer looking question probably dead mean impressive saw today probably demo could show something wondering maximum dimension matrix may training deep learning pipeline ballpark figure maximum dimension matrix know inaudible apply operation inside inaudible asking many different way answer question 100 sure useful useful answer neural inaudible typically like mentioned ten hundred million neuron average 1,000 connection neuron typical scale kind used across industry also would use well yeah actually impressed rate improvement autopilot past year model 3 two scenario wanted feedback last week first scenario right hand lane freeway highway model 3 actually able detect two car side slow let car go front one car go behind like oh gosh like insane like think model 3 could like super impressive week another scenario right hand lane right hand lane merging left lane normal highway freeway lane model 3 able detect really situation able slow speed intervene kind perspective kind share kind background neural net would unidentified speaker q unidentified participant unidentified speaker stuart tesla might adjust could improved time yeah like mentioned sophisticated trigger infrastructure intervened actually potentially likely receive clip actually analyze see happened tune system probably enter statistic okay rate correctly merging traﬃc look number look clip see wrong try fix clip make progress benchmark yes technical diﬃculty yes would potentially go phase categorization look biggest kind category actually seem semantically related simple problem would look try develop software okay one presentation software like essentially hardware stuart sort neural net vision andrej software engineering scale presented stuart next shortly afterwards ask question yeah thanks wanted brieﬂy say early ﬂight want test ride latest development software could please speak colleague drop email take test ride stuart video presentation actually clip longer uninterrupted drive intervention navigating upon highway system production today hundred thousand car stuart talk build many system scale like really short induction kind coming couple company le writing software profession 12 year thing excites really passionate taking cutting edge machine learning actually connecting customer robustness scale facebook worked initially inside ad infrastructure build machinery learning really really smart people actually tried build single platform could scale aspect business rank news feed deliver search result make every recommendation across platform became applied machine learning group something incredibly proud lot core algorithm really important improvement happened matter lot actually engineering practice build system scale thing true snap went really really excited sort actually help monetize product hardest part using google time effectively running u fairly small scale wanted build infrastructure take understanding user connect cutting edge machine learning build massive scale handed billion trillion prediction auction every day really robust opportunity came come tesla something really incredibly excited specifically take amazing thing happening hardware side computer vision ai side actually package together planning control testing kernel patching operating system continuous integration simulation actually build product get onto people car production today want talk timeline navigate autopilot going get navigate autopilot highway city street 770 million mile already navigate autopilot something really really really cool think one thing worth kind calling continuing accelerate keep learning data like andrej talked data engine accelerates actually make assertive lane change learning case intervene either failed detect merge correctly wanted car little peppy different environment want keep making progress start begin trying understand world around u talked different sensor vehicle want like dig little bit eight camera also additionally 12 ultrasonic sensor radar inertial measurement unit gps one thing forget also inaudible steering action look happening around vehicle look human chose interact environment talk clip right basically showing happening today car continuing push forward start single neural network see detection around build together multiple neural network multiple detection bring sensor convert call vector space understanding world around u something continue get better better moving logic neural network obvious end game neural network look across car brings information together ultimately output source truth world around u actually like artist rendering since actually output one debugging tool use team everyday understand world look like around u another thing think really exciting think hear sensor like lidar common question around extra sensor modality like redundancy vehicle want dig one thing always obvious neural network neural network running say wide fisheye camera neural network making one prediction world making many separate prediction actually audit real example ability detect pedestrian something train carefully put lot work also ability detect obstacle roadway pedestrian obstacle shown differently neural network say oh thing ca drive together combined give u increased sense ca front vehicle plan across multiple camera overlapping field view many place around vehicle front particularly large number overlapping field view lastly combine thing like radar ultrasonics build extremely precise understanding happening front car use learn future behavior accurate also build accurate prediction thing continue happen front u one example really exciting actually look bicyclist people ask going actually heart next generation automatic emergency braking system stop people path separate going path running shadow mode right go ﬂeet quarter talk shadow mode second want start feature like navigate autopilot highway system start learning data look human thing today assertiveness profile change lane cause either abort change like maneuver see thing immediately obvious like oh yes simultaneous merging rare complicated important start build opinion different scenario fast overtaking vehicle initially algorithm want try put ﬂeet see would done real world scenario car overtaking u quickly taken actual simulation environment showing different path considered taking overlay real world behavior user get algorithm tuned feel good specifically really taking within neural network putting vector space building tuning parameter top ultimately think machine learning go controlled deployment u early access program get couple thousand people really excited give highly vigilant useful feedback behaves open loop closed loop way real world watch intervention talk like somebody take actually get clip try understand happens one thing really actually play back open loop way ask build software getting closer farther human behave real world one thing super cool full elon r. musk stuart computer actually building rack infrastructure basically compete full computer fully wrapped build cluster actually run sophisticated data infrastructure actually understand time tune fix algorithm getting closer closer human behave ultimately exceed capability feel really good want wide rollout start actually asked everybody confirm car behavior via stock confirm started making lot lot prediction navigating highway asked people tell u right wrong chance turn data engine spot really tricky interesting long tail case think really example like interesting case simultaneous merging start going somebody move either behind noticing appropriate behavior tuning neural network need super precise appropriate behavior worked tuned background made better course time got nine million successfully accepted lane change use continuous integration infrastructure actually understand think ready one thing full really exciting since entire software stack straight kernel patching way ice bucket tuning image signal processor start collect even data even accurate allows u even better better tuning faster iteration cycle earlier month kind like ready deploy even seamless version navigate autopilot highway system seamless version require stock confirms sit relax put hand wheel oversee car case actually seeing 100,000 automated lane change every single day highway system something like super cooled u point scale thing kind excited actual lifecycle actually turn data engine crank faster faster faster time think one thing really becoming clear combination infrastructure built tooling built top combined power full computer believe even faster move autopilot highway system onto city street hand elon best knowledge lane change occurred zero accident correct yes watch every single accident elon r. musk stuart bower elon r. musk conservative obviously hundred thousand going million lane change zero accident think great achievement team thank let see thing worth mentioning order car robot taxi really need redundancy throughout vehicle hardware level starting maybe october 2016 car made tesla redundant power steering redundant motor power steering one failure motor fails car still steer power data line redundancy sever given power line data line car keep driving auxiliary power system even main pack lose complete power main pack car capable steering braking using auxiliary power system completely lose main pack car safe whole system hardware standpoint designed robot taxi since basically october 2016 rolled hardware autopilot version two expect upgrade car made think would actually cost make new car upgrade car give sense hard unless designed worth gone future glitz hardware vision lot software software problem minimized massive software problem yes managing vast amount data training data control car based vision diﬃcult software problem going going like tesla master plan obviously made bunch forward looking statement call let go statement made know way back created company separate tesla roadster said impossible even build nobody would buy like universal opinion building electric car extremely dumb would fail agreed probability failure high important built tesla roadster inaudible 2008 shipping car collector item inaudible affordable car model told impossible called fraud liar going happen untrue okay famous last word production model 2012 exceeded expectation still 2019 car compete model 2012 seven year later still waiting would build affordable car highly affordable affordable affordable model 3 bought model 3 production said get 5000 car model 3 point 5000 car week walk park u even hard large scale solar inaudible acquisition would develop place solar roof going really well version 3 solar tile roof expect spool production solar tile roof significantly later year house great sort make power roll power pack made power roll power pack fact power pack deployed massive grid scale utility system around world including largest operating battery project world 100 megawatt next probably next year two year expect gigawatt scale battery project completed thing said would going robot taxi thing criticism fair one sometimes time get done tesla team get done going year going reach combined production 10,000 week 6 3 feel confident feel confident future complete next year expand product line model semi expect first operating robot taxi next year one next year always diﬃcult like thing exponential exponential rate improvement diﬃcult correct one mind around used extrapolating linear basis got massive amount like hardware massive hardware road cumulative data increasing exponentially software getting better exponential rate feel confident predicting autonomous robot taxi tesla next year jurisdiction jurisdiction wo regulatory approval everywhere confident least regulatory approval somewhere literally next year customer able add remove car tesla network expect operate somewhat sort like combination maybe uber airbnb model car add subtract tesla network tesla would take 25 30 revenue place enough people sharing car would dedicated tesla vehicle use car show ride sharing app able summon car parking lot get go drive really simple take tesla app currently update app add summon tesla commit car ﬂeet see summon car add summon tesla add add subtract car ﬂeet able phone see potential smoothing demand pushing curve car operate much higher utility old car operator like typically use car 10 hour 12 hour week people drive 1.5 hour 2 hour day typically 10 hour 12 hour week total driving car operate autonomously likely could probably likely could car operate third week longer 168 hour week probably got something order 55 hour 60 hour week operation maybe bit longer fundamental utility vehicle increase factor 5 look macroeconomic standpoint say like operating vague simulation could upgrade simulation increase utility car factor 5 would massive increase economic eﬃciency simulation gigantic model 3 s3 x taxi made important change lease lease model 3 option buying end lease want back buy car keep lease give back said location enough supply sharing tesla make car add network place current cost model 3 robotaxi le 38,000 expect number improve time resigning car car currently built designed million mile operation drive unit line test validated million mile operation current battery pack maybe 300,000 mile 500,000 mile new battery pack probably go production next year designed exclusively million mile operation entire vehicle battery pack inclusive designed operate million mile minimal maintenance actually adjusting tyre design really optimizing car high proficient robotaxi point wo need steering wheel pedal leave thing become le le important leave part wo say like probably two year make car steering wheel pedal need accelerate time always delete part easy probably say long term three year robotaxis eliminated part maybe end 25,000 le want super eﬃcient car electricity consumption low currently 1.5 mile per kilowatt hour improve five beyond really company full stack integration got vehicle design manufacturing got computer hardware got software development ai got far biggest suite extremely diﬃcult impossible perhaps extremely diﬃcult catch tesla 100 time mile per day everyone else combined cost running gasoline car average cost running car u taken aaa currently 0.62 mile 1,000 mile 15 million vehicle add 2 trillion year literally taken aaa website cost ridesharing according uber lyft 2 3 mile cost run robotaxi think le 0.18 mile dropping like would current cost future cost lower say would probable q unidentified participant unidentified speaker q analyst elon r. muskgross profit single robotaxi think probably something order 30,000 per year expect designing car way commercial semi truck designed commercial designed life designing car life well nominal dollar would little 300,000 course 11 year maybe higher think consumption actually relatively conservative assumes 50 mile driven nothing useful 50 utility middle next year million tesla car road full hardware feature complete reliably level would consider one need pay attention meaning could go sleep standpoint fast forward year look maybe year maybe year three month next year sure million robotaxis road ﬂeet wake within year update take say net present value robotaxi probably order 200,000 buying model 3 good deal question well mean want ﬂeet ﬂeet ﬂeet know guess probably order 10 million vehicle mean production rate generally look compound annual production rate since 2012 like first full year le production went 23,000 vehicle produced 2013 around 250,000 vehicle produced last year course five year increased output factor 10 would expect something similar occurs next five six year sharing sharing versus know nice thing essentially customer fronting u money car great term one thing snake charger curious also determine pricing look like undercutting average lyft uber ride 50 curious could talk little bit pricing strategy sure would expect solving snake charger pretty straightforward vision standpoint like known situation kind known situation vision like charge port trivial yes car would automatically park automatically plug would one human supervision required yes q colin rusch elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. muskso pricing threw number mean think definitely plug whatever pricing think make sense kind randomly said okay maybe 1 thing like like order 2 billion car truck world robotaxis extremely high demand long time observation far auto industry slow adapt mean like said still car road buy today good model 2012 suggests pretty slow rate adaptation car industry probably 1 conservative next 10 year also sort think like like actually enough appreciation diﬃculty manufacturing manufacturing insanely diﬃcult lot people talk think like right design like instantly make much thing world want true extremely hard design new manufacturing system new technology mean audi major problem manufacturing extremely good manufacturing problem others order 2 billion car truck world order 100 million unit per year production capacity vehicle old design take long time convert full car really need electric cost operation gasoline diesel car much higher electric car robotaxi electric absolutely competitive elon colin rusch oppenheimer obviously appreciate customer fronting cash ﬂeet getting built sound like massive balance sheet commitment organization course time talk little bit look like expectation term financing next call three year three four year building ﬂeet starting monetize customer base aiming beat approximately cash ﬂow neutral ﬂeet build phase expected extremely cash ﬂow positive robotaxis enabled want talk financing round would diﬃcult financing round venue think make right move think make move think make

unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participantso even private person like go buy 10 model 3 ca run network business right allowed use tesla network right use tesla network theory could run car showing robotaxi business 10 model 3 yes like app store add add remove tesla network tesla get revenue share similar airbnb though home car rent make extra income owning multiple car renting like model 3 aspire get roadster next build going rent model 3 would give back guess could operate rental car ﬂeet think unwieldy yes know seems easy okay try order operate robotaxi network sound like solve certain problem like example auto pilot today steer let take ridesharing product someone else getting passenger seat like moving steering ca let person take car example might even driver seat hardware already robotaxi might get situation cop pulling human might need intervene like using central ﬂeet operator remotely sort interact human mean type infrastructure already built car make sense elon r. musk q unidentified participant pete bannon q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk think sort phone home thing car get stuck phone home tesla ask solution thing like pulled police oﬃcer easy u program problem possible somebody take using steering wheel least period time probably road cap steering wheel steering control take steering wheel put cap give like couple year hardware modification car order enable yes literally unbolt steering wheel put cap steering wheel handle currently like future car would put today car steering wheel mechanism take autopilot like robotaxi mode would someone able take simply moving steering wheel type yes think transition period people able take able take robotaxi regulator comfortable u steering wheel delete car ﬂeet obviously permission owner owned somebody else would take steering wheel put cap steering wheel currently touch might like two phase robotaxi one service provided come driver could potentially take future might driver option see well like ... future wo future probability steering wheel taken away future 100 consumer demand initially would ... q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q analyst elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. muskthis want clear proscribing point view world predicting consumer demand yes consumer demand future people allowed drive two ton death machine totally totally agree order model 3 today part robotaxi network call would get driver seat essentially safe right make sense thank bye exactly thank sort like amphibian pretty much thing become like land creature little bit surviving amphibian phase hi strategy heard player robotaxi space select certain municipal area create way using hd map confined area bit safety hear much today around importance hd map extent hd map necessary second also hear much deploying specific municipality working municipality get buy also getting defined area importance hd map extent looking specific municipality rollout think hd map mistake actually hd map actually ca count either need hd map case anything change environment car break need hd map case wasting time hd map hd map thing like two main crutch used wo retrospect retrospect obviously false foolish lidar hd map mark word q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. muskhello need area real sound like maybe battery supply could bottleneck left towards vision also could clarify get battery pack last million mile think cell constraint subject whole separate whole separate subject think actually going want push u sort standard range plus battery long range battery energy content long range pack 50 higher kilowatt hour essentially make third car sort stand range plus instead long range pack one like around 50 kilowatt hour older one around 75 kilowatt hour actually calling bias sale intentionally towards smaller battery pack order higher volume basically obvious next thing think maximize number autonomous unit number maximize output subsequently result biggest autonomously road making number thing regard today meeting million mile life ... million basically getting cycle life pack need basically order like say got basic math got 250 mile range pack going need 4,000 cycle achievable already stationary storage stationary storage solution like power pack

car hardware necessary full like buying horse car hardware necessary full tesla like really think purchase vehicle basically crazy buy car tesla need make convey augment clearly today perfect thanks bringing future present informational time today wondering like talk much tesla pickup let give context could wrong way looking tesla network early adopter something test bread think tesla pick maybe first phase elon r. musk q colin langan elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participantof putting vehicle network utility tesla pickup would pretty much people either loading lot stuff profession construction little odd item like picking stuff home depot would say maybe need two stage process pickup truck exclusively tesla network starting point people like buy later thought well today really autonomy lot could talk cell production pickup truck future vehicle today focus autonomy agree major thing excited tesla pickup truck unveiling year going great colin langan ubs understand definition refer feature complete sound like talking level 5 fence expected end year thing regulatory process mean talked regulator seems quite aggressive timeline people put mean hurdle needed timeline get approval need thing like california tracking mile operator line need thing process going look like yes talked regulator around world time introduce additional feature like navigate autopilot requires like regulatory approval project jurisdiction basis think fundamentally regulator experience convinced data massive amount data show autonomy safe listen may take time digest information process may take bit time always come right conclusion seen question got light eye pillar okay wanted work done trying better understand ride hail market look like concentrated major dense urban center way think robo taxi would probably deploy area additional full self driving personally vehicle would suburban area elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant think like probably yes like tesla owned robo taxi would dense urban area along customer vehicle get medium low density area would tend people car occasionally lend inaudible yes lot edge case manhattan say downtown san francisco various area around world challenging urban environment expect significant issue say feature complete mean work downtown san francisco downtown manhattan year hi neural net architecture question use different model say path planning perception different type ai sort split problem across different piece autonomy well essentially right ai neural net use really object recognition still basically using still frame identifying object still frame tying together perception path planning layer thereafter happening steadily neural net kind heating software base time expect neural net computational cost standpoint thing simple heuristic diﬃcult neural net probably make sense maintain level heuristic system computationally thousand time easier neural net neural net like cruise missile try swat ﬂy use ﬂy swatter cruise missile overtime would expect move really training video car steering pedal basically video lateral longitudinal acceleration almost entirely last going use dojo system system currently maybe going back sensor suite discussion one area like talk lack side radar situation intersection stop sign maybe 35 mile 40 mile per hour cross traﬃc comfortable sensor suite side camera able handle maybe talk elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk yes problem essentially car going kind human would like think human like basically camera slow gimbal quite remarkable people able drive car way ca look direction car literally look direction multiple camera human able drive sort looking way looking way actually stuck driver seat ca really get driver seat kind one camera gimbal able drive conscientious driver drive high safety camera car better advantage point person like b pillar front rear view mirror really got great vantage point turning road got lot high speed traﬃc quest like gradual like turn little bit go fully road let camera see going thing look good rear camera show oncoming traﬃc go look sketchy pull back little bit like person behavior like remarkably start become remarkably lifelike like quite eerie actually good car start behaving like person go ventriloquist right okay given value creating auto business wrapping technology around guess curious would still taking cell capacity putting power wall power pack would make sense put every single unit make part business already stolen almost cell line meant go power power pack use model 3 mean last year order make model 3 production cell starved convert 2170 line gigafactory car cell actual output total gigawatt hour stationary storage compared vehicle order magnitude different stationary storage basically use whole bunch miscellaneous cell gather cell multiple supplier around world homologation issue safety issue like car basically stationary battery business kind beating scrap quite like everything like production many many constraint massive production system like degree manufacturing supply chain underappreciated amazing whole series constraint constraint one week may q adam jonas elon r. musk q adam jonas elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participantconstraint another week insanely diﬃcult make car especially one rapidly evolving yeah take question think break cut car hi elon adam jonas question safety data share u today safe technology obviously important regulatory insurance discussion published accident per mile every quarter see right autopilot twice safe normal driver average expect increase quite bit time like said future consumer want outlaw think succeed saying agree position future consumer want outlaw people driving car unsafe thing like elevator elevator use operated big lever like go ﬂoor like big relay yet elevator operator periodically would get tired drunk something would turn lever wrong time sever somebody half tell elevator operator would quite alarming went elevator big lever could move ﬂoors arbitrarily button value judgment saying want world way saying consumer likely demanded people live broadcast elon follow share u much tesla spending autopilot autonomous technology order magnitude annual basis thank basically entire expense structure question economics tesla network understand look like get model 3 lease 25,000 go
