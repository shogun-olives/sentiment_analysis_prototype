going fade situation normalizes going go back low growth market share shift going come traditional vendor space cisco webex logmein go meet citrix gotomeeting people end replacing premise tool traditional premise tool newer tool like zoom like slack acceleration market share shift result whole virus situation every vendor talked wanted move customer cloud even heavy presence many happy hybrid solution ultimately accelerate conferencing successful movement cloud partially zoom success fully cloud also seeing vendor like ringcentral 8x8 successful logmein well lot company needle say microsoft google included pretty much everyone every vendor always wanted move cloud one thing hear time time lot vendor solution want upgrade thing working unfortunately creates issue rooted user experience often security need q mandeep singh wayne kurtzmanso cloud solution really enables customer get best user experience believe exception certain security high security issue going see continued acceleration cloud quite sure late period cagr ﬂoating around 90 caution market looking right excludes telephony vendor buy telephony get software example traditional pbx might cloud offering buy forecast cloud percentage high software market seeing jumping traditional cloud lot vendor made jump starting scale lot basing open source good lot place develop really outstanding solution almost video webrtc standard made easy people company deliver solution wrap way turn big deal right got mentioned open source freemium lot cio still reluctant least reluctant whole virus situation deploy freemium open source product think security remain big concern come single point product deployed cloud may secure framework google suite microsoft suite offer security always top foremost number one protect protect noticed shift last five year cio report cio gone `` shall way bring bring problem solve learning people probably got fired seven year ago bringing working cio teach cio add knowledge security governance compliance necessary realizing newer product includes zoom slack atlassians world sometimes even cisco webex logmein coming really solve larger business problem

attached work better fact remove layer friction keep thing together record microsoft team brings science ph together different way best chat tool yet know want get really good getting tremendously better believe better together q mandeep singh wayne kurtzmanif take zoom google hangout meeting solution different well personally miss augmented reality little crown thing google used put business thing need business tool need background zoom enables u need thing easy use zoom added security feature changed default reacted quickly lot think lot negative hype hype lot problem user issue take step fix google integration g suite honest zoom wo integrate either really closer game really want look different benefit available platform ai ml open ml example within google suite g suite allows certain thing may incredibly valuable start moving toward goal knowledge management retaining every conversation way becomes data actually usable later one big problem ton data data know started looking web log sudden got insight thing used worked point able verge ai training ml really beef depth knowledge around individual work collective body work done team slack microsoft team different
