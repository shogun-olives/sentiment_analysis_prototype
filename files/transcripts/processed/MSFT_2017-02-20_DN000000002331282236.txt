professional service accessed bi go let pas ashish go presentation ashish thank mandeep hello everyone thank joining today webcast big data market presentation talking big data business analytics slightly interchangeably set context get name ashish nadkarni program director idc cover computing platform research also big data initiative evolved last four five year evolved main reason big data evolve company embrace digital transformation business analytics big data business analytics pivotal pillar people rest business business model goal create greater operational eï¬ƒciency building deep relationship customer creating new revenue stream based technology enabled product service underpinning data many time past lot business decision made based survey user sentiment day much based data data either collected telemetric fashion device collected user sentiment collected website much data diverse desperate bringing together form collation analyzing people believe 2018 third leader every industry disrupted third platform competitor third platform competitor whether uber whether tesla whoever look disruptor respective market segment would using approach big data based approach solving business problem sort talking see going much fueled reason one thing seeing big data world notion distributed model whether talk internet thing whether talk connected car whether talk autonomous device drone world data center longer compute unit longer restraining factor analytics happens world much analytics distributed entity analytics endpoint example mobile phone might level preliminary analytics given compute capability phone edge point edge device located different place good enough compute capacity preliminary training finally cloud people store lot data amalgamous ph fashion addition core basically business application reside live world need manage everything lot emphasis data locality security making sure asset management control saying sort also side problem big data look market outlook need make sure issue addressed looking solution introduced vendor looking big data important note big data happen vacuum important know analytics really six thing mentioned first one data persistence mean data life important leaf important manner stored important whether talking block storage traditional block storage data center talking amazon s3 whether talking azure talking file storage important know big data requires data persistence data life talking streaming data data transit never captured never stored always analyzed transit data storage data persistence come second data management able glue data together whether form database whether form data fabric bringing data together sort technical diï¬ƒculty analytics important apps important third one making sure application touch pulse user using mobile application mobile application capture sentiment way important next time try use app give relevant information accelerated computing sort umbrella term thing like cognitive artificial intelligence machine learning mean use right technology improve accelerate outcome whether cognitive function whether machine learning accelerate outcome using certain type technology like gp gpus fifth analytics technical diï¬ƒculty big data know data storage piece talked earlier also analytics analytics meaningful done timely fashion done fashion relevant business talking iterative science experiment talking analytics directly impacting business finally edge workload like mentioned earlier analyzing data life luxury centralizing data much data might old technical diï¬ƒculty time need able analyze data whether twitter feed whether social medium interaction whether clickstream data data analyzed generated lose important information contained data six tenant big data sort go across six looking taxonomy slide wo bore detail note look big data model model pretty much go across entire software spectrum idc fairly robust one industry best software taxonomy see slide look big data go pretty much span vertical horizontal spectrum taxonomical deck see notice talk enterprise performance management talk production planning talk cognitive ai ph talk continuous analytics get idea mean big data one size fit single entity actually collective conglomerate multiple spread across entire software spectrum classify big data one thing need note need define big data lot industry term talk big data different way u really volume variety velocity volume mean data collected excess 100 terabyte ph generated growing 60 and/or received streaming deployed dynamically adaptable infrastructure key lot static application used traditional business analytics use case much infrastructure pretty static rigid big data structure data changing rapidly need agility need elasticity ultimately three key principle volume variety velocity provide big data one mention structure value ultimately value information generated relevant business business find value information big data analytics technical diï¬ƒculty meaning important know iterative cycle find thing know iterative cycle answer question asking year talk big data workï¬‚ow think big data big sieve information data raw data pass get processed ultimately get applied base eye chart going bore information icon note data created data acquired information processed ultimately fed business process becomes important loop business know getting generate question ask data generated feedback cycle continuous cycle go many business fact entire business run data creation data acquisition machine processing ultimately business process said would sort jump right number seeing 2017 would expect big data cross 32 billion 32 billion includes software hardware service see big chunk market comprises infrastructure hardware reason ultimately see right pie chart show lot big data various reason governance regulatory compliance stored stored much longer one would expect stored technical diï¬ƒculty people want believe data know necessary information contained people hang data lot computer important people analyze data see networking infrastructure infrastructure form smaller portion market similarly notice business analytics market going 153 billion market 2017 growing much faster see compute side business analytics form bigger portion infrastructure market need explain big data business analytics interchangeable business analytics uber market bigger market think big data portion segment business analytics overall business analytics market seeing 153 billion market 100 sorry 100 big data market segment bigger business analytics market going back previous slide slide notice business analytics big data set business analytics also small data set many business analytics function operate terabyte scale data set operate small data set know differentiation come three slide ago talked big data workload classified classified big data workload everything else becomes business analytics workload important note big data anything foreign portion business analytics market 2017 made taxonomy change make 100 segment business analytics compare talked previously could look market fashion look big data rest analytics rest analytics see growing growing much smaller rate big data market growing lot faster rate reason many data set people operate today require different form processing data set becoming larger larger luxury dealing small data set longer many data set increase size sheer quantity collection mechanism example dealing mobile data sheer number smartphones mobile data extremely high give another example talk aircraft engine generating data single ï¬‚ight given amount sensor present different aspect aircraft engine total ï¬‚ight time generates whole lot data need analyzed luxury dealing smaller data set luxury dealing static data set longer becoming niche sort wanted end ph key market driver inhibitor key market driver going go key thing increased belief data driven decision making much executive convinced decision technical diï¬ƒculty nature driven data used portion executive ph driven gut driven market sentiment day data driven emphasis much pretty big risk base decision data second availability data lot democratization democratization data mean many company get access social medium data get access anonymized machine generated data anonymized mobile data anonymized financial data use better inform availability data make easier decision making superior versus technical diï¬ƒculty make decision based data disposal third one demand era people want wait people want able service request directly lot emphasis automation behind scene data integration automation result emphasis based automated analytics cognitive analytics ai machine learning lot company focused big data result lot investment software segment even service segment inhibitor main two inhibitor wanted talk macroeconomic factor clearly place much buyer sentiment economic situation country region industry seeing ebb ï¬‚ow guy expert going talk know market sentiment directly impacted factor second one talk length impact source world thanks linux thanks apache foundation world software becoming increasingly entity people want spend software get based variant available developer becoming lot powerful company developer get access snippet code directly world construct stack without commercial need buy commercial software see slide number hardware segment growing obviously want run analytics service segment growing people obviously want give turnkey element software revenue segment growing much lot revenue getting lost alternative dearth alternative every segment software spectrum whether cognitive whether machine learning whether kind analytics like hadoop see dearth alternative fact company culture developer need go software use finally wanted end note main market trend first public cloud provider like amazon google microsoft continuing aggressively invest big data analytics sort building value mandeep singhproposition beyond infrastructure service therefore going enterprise segment big data ecosystem play wo single company dominate ecosystem know give example hadoop spark ecosystem sort growing ecosystem iot space ecosystem growing cognitive space ecosystem dominate big data space allows people take modular approach approach building stack infrastructure vendor think see largely giving software effort going partnership going partnership hadoop distributor spark distributor really making sure focus enabling software versus developing software see cognitive artificial intelligence machine learning initially offshoot look taxonomy clearly offshoot bigger analytics market eventually become standalone market grow become mature lastly money follow hadoop best example give linux good example know company like red hat million ph commercializing linux suse following canonical following money ï¬‚ow ecosystem turn ï¬‚ow community shape form give rise vendor building model based building business model based commercializing open source wanted end note open call q back mandeep question answer yeah thank ashish comprehensive would encourage everybody call send question meantime question ashish following big data market long time focus shifted structured unstructured data predictive analytics recommendation engine kind evolving get sense roi obvious come big data project sometimes take long investment cycle really say okay achieve using big data system would say standalone big data kind future overlay ai cloud really drive roi ashish nadkarni mandeep singh ashish nadkarni think latter great question basically one trend big data seeing technology going nascent primitive technology mature market people realizing create ph big data science experiment create big data iterative model people sitting lab somewhere generating data data analyzing analyzing tied business outcome business outcome people evolve thing like internet thing able deliver product entirely based market data collection overlaying cognitive machine learning fact conference last week ibm attached watson internet thing watson iot platform developed munich service play company encouraged collocate developer ibm tie analytics internet thing whole thing become focus gather data market device analyze make roi becomes almost mandate people say right investing x number dollar enabling internet enabling washing machine example need able per dollar per unit cost roi reducing number customer support call reducing number failure component forth roi becomes overall objective iot system let say driverless car use case pick anything healthcare going big data use case else need along standard big data technology like hadoop spark based environment else need make project successful like company think kind implementing big data system sure sort let start making sort general statement think term big data slowly melting blending whole business analytics thing sort started use term big data analytics overall market reason unpack big data data storage component big data part analytics part slowly getting attached industry use case mentioned autonomous vehicle mentioned healthcare every data storage part talked structured unstructured piece previous question data storage part moving much meaning format data changing much mandeep singh ashish nadkarniwhat changing analytics piece analytics piece slowly becoming specialized industry centric use case driven kind driven thing like cognitive artificial intelligence technical diï¬ƒculty learning three different way get become lot prevalent call big data analytics general term know big data piece static say data storage piece le changing two analytics piece dynamic two get industry use case get model data technical diï¬ƒculty example specialized based outcome kind stuff really important distinction think really help u understand much better way part big data market actually moving faster versus said data storage part static note company think applying analytics piece use case oriented way able establish cutting edge use case vendor come mind let kind take industry segment segment easier talk way apart basic side right company like nvidia intel focusing lot hardware aspect accelerated computing lot focus gp gpu fpgas thing enhance capability would call industry standard started research big data beat cpu server analyze much data increasing emphasis hey cpu ca everything memory server ca everything need able oï¬ „ oad onto technical diï¬ƒculty gp gpus fpgas company like nvidia amd intel focusing accelerated computing whole ï¬‚ash array market alive well lot focus analyze large quantity data without beating upon spinning desk whole memory segment company like sandisk western digital component vendor coming superior silicon superior memory hold large quantity data fact read comment day intel thinking 2017 memory market going grow lot newer big data technology use recomputing sap hana one kind see infrastructure market reached plateau speed feed branching different type compute model compute storage model mandeep singh ashish nadkarniand let shift software technical diï¬ƒculty software expert see company becoming specialized industry specific use case give example whole watson ibm watson iot driven applying cognitive layer internet thing layer ibm example company called cognitive scale based watson lot healthcare specific stuff company like splunk operational analytics course lot emphasis spark investment ibm committed like couple billion dollar technical diï¬ƒculty spark lot company trying make spark standard overlay top hadoop model cloudera hortonworks mapr variance spark traditional company like oracle teradata getting market underlying theme lot lot hardware infrastructure space might become lot cooled little bit would say minus comment made earlier gpus software space seems much alive well lot activity building industry specific use case one thing mention sort straddle software hardware blockchain notice idc focusing lot blockchain year think blockchain context big data analytics going huge primarily drive lot security lot focused secured transaction blockchain become important blockchain ledger system lot analytics behind technical diï¬ƒculty people working make sure blockchain transaction optimized course let forget service company bpo market earlier tech mahindra example becoming focused analytics service big data service public cloud service provider getting lot many company know get making easier others get great question audience steve asking big data open source software powerful commercially available software depends see whole stack let take vanilla hadoop example year ago hadoop became known enterprise lot company show stick commercial plugins survey three year ago amount number company going vanilla hadoop whole hadoop distribution limited minority vanilla hadoop lot problem lot single point failure stable mandeep singh ashish nadkarnifast forward three year later many thing ph ironed many issue sorted vanilla hadoop lot stable lot robust something start open source never good commercial variant commercial technical diï¬ƒculty developer many work company contributing code commercial space well open source space much tune challenge address period time issue get sorted additionally take spark example spark technical diï¬ƒculty apache foundation open source project would probably seen slower trajectory term commercialization enterprise readiness company like ibm cloudera others making spark priority today year spark conference lot commercial vendor going put might behind spark accelerates adoption accelerates development effort overall start see lot open source project become lot give commercial variance run money shorter amount time want piggyback basically lot legacy data warehousing company huge installed base kind dipping toe new big data solution based hadoop spark mentioned way industry headed going change data warehousing solution new kind evolving technology big data realm going continue see data warehousing market evolving think short medium term perhaps even long run traditional data warehousing market probably going okay reason directly fed traditional business analytics business intelligence application see enterprise whether retail whether healthcare whoever else got traditional business analytics application going continue keep proprietary enterprise data warehouse keep investing one one correlation however see going start supplement edws data warehouse going based spark based hadoop based application development data going fed clearly company like teradata oracle acknowledged going happen therefore trying offer edw supplier come investing data warehouse want maintain installed base would rather vendor buyer come versus go something else mandeep singh ashish nadkarni mandeep singh ashish nadkarniso offering connector allow oï¬ „ oad technical diï¬ƒculty data edw data warehouse get initial play going edw traditional workload data warehouse workload data warehouse today also going become tier 2 stack archival purpose everybody know enterprise data warehouse expensive ph going spend whole lot money doubling edw capacity rather spend money doubling data warehouse capacity short medium run think installed base probably okay also realized invest data warehouse honey journey going come towards slow crawl eventually trouble another audience question asking big data adoption industry industry lagging behind know think industry lagging behind let let start saying see big data analytics pretty much go span across industry industry acknowledged deal traditional market mechanism traditional mechanism even take telco industry really traditional telco industry much disrupted mobile internet thing new upset newer mobile operator like google facebook entering fray well even traditional industry closed industry technical diï¬ƒculty started accelerate big data initiative would unfair say industry lagging mean clearly might heavily regulated industry probably one might pause investing lot big data current investment know enterprise data warehouse enterprise business analytics application acknowledged need dip toe big data start jump journey going eradicated short amount time okay fair enough think cloud help facilitate migration term legacy data warehouse warehouse cloud role play expedite transition mean certain company still using mainframe obviously really moved big data environment even close cloud help company get faster mandeep singh ashish nadkarniso cloud definitely help think help two way one company traditionally run rigid time consuming alternative go quickly jump cloud start test water big data way help company like amazon invest turnkey big data solution company start avail service without build stack ground third way cloud help offer quick trying new thing might otherwise hesitant test test quickly without touch bread butter infrastructure without risk mentioned something mainframe seeing people hesitant mainframe ibm fact bringing big data mainframe know tracking ibm last week announced machine learning z system told machine learning z/os customer linux customer z/os customer clearly ibm recognizing mainframe technical diï¬ƒculty get big data experience directly mainframe going effect alienate installed base smart bringing big data mainframe okay interesting know could big data overlaid mainframe system guess ibm making possible clearly interesting trend wanted talk ai little bit obviously every company know often ai taken somewhat approach come developing ai system think edge big data give kind capability come ai ai algorithm go really crunching data applying machine learning big data really make difference let sort start untangling term use often use interchangeably technical diï¬ƒculty way looking machine learning artificial intelligence cognitive comparing one one three different aspect brain brain human brain amphibian brain sort trigger driven example touch hot stove take finger away know hot hurt quick react someone poke want quickly react run away amphibian part brain could almost compare machine learning mammalian part brain scale ability think basic pattern artificial intelligence come could compared artificial intelligence technical diï¬ƒculty could almost compare human human part brain make u different amphibian sorry mammalian counterpart kingdom mandeep singh ashish nadkarni mandeep singh ashish nadkarniso could almost think three thing staggered stacked approach adding intelligence application look big data analytics information big data part could probably providing big data information machine learning part artificial intelligence part cognitive part information change much way operate analytics part change lot artificial intelligence sorry machine learning part operates big data could binary kind yes kind algorithm processed put artificial intelligence data lot intelligent stuff autonomous car drone alexa echo siri could technical diï¬ƒculty artificial intelligence lot pattern matching going lot processing going finally apply cognitive data taking data different level intelligence different level think yet mean lot time people talk cognitive really straddling machine learning artificial intelligence cognitive would much reading data human able make advanced decision next think yet okay wonderful enlightening end audience question one question around study done roi use case big data traditional organization lot hype would able repeat question sorry study done roi use big data traditional organization still lot hype good question believe answer lot hype study far roi interesting concept come applying industry organization custom roi even industry different company industry might different lot custom lot specific company try mobilize investment try get return answer think study emerging lot commissioned study bias towards installed base bias towards vendor lot uncommissioned neutral agnostic mandeep singh ashish nadkarnistudies would truly try shine light challenge gathering roi realizing roi term large investment okay thank much ashish time great fact hardware software perspective come big data market think trend told u around blockchain kind delineating storage part versus analytics part use case talked think audience would find really useful housekeeping note slide transcript available terminal well replay webcast would also encourage everybody take look theme published big data infrastructure software dashboard focused around vendor think everyone would find interesting thank much ashish really enjoyed webinar look forward future webinars thank pleasure thank
