three three platform first one pc business particular part core core relates gaming industry well design two area term geforce quadro strong growth term gaming segment year year within quarter growing 36 largely due release maxwell architecture released within quarter adoption quite nicely term overall gaming tremendous improvement overall gaming universe second platform datacenter cloud also extremely well hit another record quarter overall tesla business high performance computing parallel computing aspect new machine learning seeing overall mobile business also strong quarter growing year year associated different socs socs lot different mobile platform tablet phone well mobile type platform automobile saw doubling growth term automobile really pleased transformation chip type approach really platform approach done across think take lot work last couple year really working end customer think gaming think datacenter think want provide consumer mobile really reaching establishing software around mean ecosystem grow pleased colette kressokay thanks introduction maybe could follow comment mentioned platform strategy term nvidia transforming chip company company could tell u think using baseball analogy far along term taking product portfolio change addition software resource diversification sale stickier revenue opportunity yes definitely focus thought amount innovation built overall gpu gpu overall visual capability well compute really expanding market really leverage capability experienced overall gaming side really kind talk gaming extremely

business gaming growing almost double gaming notebook becoming tremendous popular interesting attach rate u okay thanks sharing color pc gpus could follow datacenter gpus term grid look like number would suggest test trial 20 time versus past two year try compare note would 1,000 perhaps discus revenue conversion rate seen test trial past couple quarter typical qualification prospective customer go datacenter gpus yes let start back term overall grid platform grid virtualized gpu different relationship current gpus desktop notebook server talking multicurrency concurrency user reaching overall gpu may located server streaming environment cloud environment access gpu bringing unique use case would viable vdi opportunity enterprise also term consumer streaming gaming becomes important market think way approach really certification oems grid take place different cloud environment importantly working key partner citrix well vmware key virtualization provider across world client aspect well backend server aspect steven chin colette kressso period time grid product available working one partner develop software within offering allow grid opportunity work seamlessly across environment understanding well adoption trial interest continues grow anything enterprise time take start one two trial understand move project move broad availability take time case wish specific time long take solving pretty important need aspect see immediate rollout aspect working vmware working citrix availability software take part bigger bigger type deployment within year expecting ten million dollar grid great start really market year tremendously strong outlook term growth provider cloud enables quite bit unique ability global team work share visually important rendering across world scenario great thanks sharing thought grid maybe staying datacenter gpus question tesla especially compute application also done well nvidia past year question continued demand seeing tesla would characterize repeat buying also new customer perhaps new application thought tesla yes tesla definitely great product last five year focused computing environment parallel processing really key understanding overall cuda development platform really take lot workload cpu gpu environment continues great growth opportunity interesting expansion happening last year focus machine learning artificial intelligence really training overall application server term information internet service provider cloud service provider around world really focused amount data voice video traveling network wanting really get good understanding tag different information steven chin colette kressas see many service provider use voice recognition voice recognition across many different dialect many different language important use gpu teach application high area interest also move term video picture tagging well meaning recognize dog labrador dog across cartoon colored picture type artistic view interesting field tremendous amount research education well internet service provider driven tremendous project growth u tesla business allowing u reach record level entering initial think phase machine learning expansion tremendous understanding research term capability okay thanks sharing thought tesla maybe transition mobile gpus tablet front shield shield handheld also shield product know like highlight success shield given sold nvidia brand name maybe could help u characterize demand product kind thinking shield yes shield family product including shield tablet really set product using underlying mobile gpus overall gaming industry learned tremendous brand recognition following overall gaming market wanting move mobile type piece better opportunity overall tablet geared underlying technology take advantage review response tablet tremendous term best performing tablet market take advantage gaming experience really expansion necessary expansion know enter sport gaming
