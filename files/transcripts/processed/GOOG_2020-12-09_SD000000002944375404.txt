implementation right really key thing think key learning even future understood maybe turning business one often question get investor think addressable market ad advertising think yes great question look think lot people general actually misunderstand addressable market least hear lot conï¬‚icting view way would think point hear often let put way called advertising market 0.5 trillion market roughly across world slightly different estimate usually defined addressable market obviously feel line advertising market includes budget promotional pricing product placement sponsorship significant market well completely different way looking take different vector example look commerce penetration u.s. know somewhere 80 range commerce u.s. still conducted oï¬ „ ine shifting time obviously significant opportunity would say eric sheridan philipp schindlerand general think market really business connecting business consumer actually business business think like think long really driving incremental roi partner advertiser pretty good place great google started mission organizing world information company 20 year journey maybe talk little bit search evolved google continuing innovate mission yes look mean make thousand improvement search every year see billion search every day 15 never seen actually quite interesting number pay tribute team working innovation behind everything go simply extraordinary really incredible accomplishment lot competition space mean pick phone look different way access information toe obviously lot better lot future give example innovation gone search literally like last couple year take example artificial intelligence completely revolutionizing understanding natural language processing natural language understanding seen launch like bird model massive impact understand query search side example take video side much deeper understanding deep semantics video allows basically ï¬‚ip video like chapter book impressive technology take look thing like lens could look google lens another input factor search obviously different input vector could type could speak could actually use image progress seen area lens recognize like area 15 billion different thing large number think 15x couple year ago significant progress innovation look product like map example way managed introduce give much higher percentage call busyness information business busyness whether merchant retailer place restaurant busy hugely important actually moment think distance management different thing gone think 5x since june last month type information eric sheridan philipp schindlerif look something like augmented reality live view map actually point camera business see example safety information business something along line actually pretty complex launched look duplex ai example business side automated system reaching updating information task consumer pretty impressive actually thing look little bit like fun like pretty public hum search launch example hum google recognize pretty sophisticated machine learning kind song humming think base technology take time actually little bit playful lot innovation might always visible actually going core search product well maybe stick lot want stick search 1 minute curious look focusing search area improve customer experience time think lens increasing roi advertiser yes look make 100 enhancement ad world roughly every quarter quite significant number think easiest way think least easiest way think breaking different component part let look 4 key driver let take search ad business second number one obviously world query key question best place user turn need information next question obviously provide better answer provide comprehensive answer come type question real question shift digital seeing moment end line people going use rather search le look information search whole component course second big one obviously whole point around ad coverage another big component really question percent query either commercial number one obviously percentage actually cover ad philosophy stated many time try use ad actually display ad helpful user helpful user interesting number 80 search actually show ad ad actually seeing search form commercial intent whatever could anything shoe baby yoda eric sheridan philipp schindlerdolls whatever take right question ask actually optimized room better area third component whole thing obviously rate rate depend lot different thing question ad actually serving giving best answer creatives best creatives obviously big impact know rate different industry insight big question course like really away 100 obviously path u better path u better probably upside world next one fourth component really really important one obviously cost per click cost per click really dependent obviously quality traï¬ƒc sending partner advertiser number one importantly driven conversion rate thing said around rate past insight conversion rate different industry obviously far 100 question still better help partner invest optimizing landing page better providing even better measurement tool conversion might even measured correctly better helping integrating different system think probably best way look 4 factor think innovation core search ad business still pretty vibrant great okay earlier referenced artificial intelligence machine learning one earlier answer lot buzz around ai machine learning continues among investment community broader social commentary especially google investment area talk ai machine learning improves google user experience ad offering value bring advertiser yes talked core search innovation example ai obviously play huge role come improving advertising product across whole bunch different area give example product like responsive search ad example new campaign type introduced like performance max heavily built machine learning capability product like smart display campaign example ai play integral role frankly broad match keywords making eric sheridan philipp schindler eric sheridanlot easier advertiser use ai basically keyword selection versus individually picking could go also keep mind ai ml get better think actually interesting path ahead would say great think one biggest learning past year pandemic clearly accelerated adoption global scale shift affected business look doubt seen accelerated adoption shift due obviously covid doubt would say 2 big trend seeing first one people buying thing online ever definitely something benefiting business benefiting others see lot smbs local business actually managed transition correctly also taking advantage trend undeniable number one second one would say point actually high demand curbside pickup pickup see query patent look query like available near example query available near connected something somewhere 100 range look query pattern like curbside pickup actually somewhere 3,000 range obviously merchant comprehensive offer take advantage probably pretty well positioned see bunch whole across whole bunch different retailer take simple example company like petco actually see curbside pickup drove 100 increase business right adjustment make intuitive sense obviously general would say advertiser best really one pivoted quickly react change user behavior spent lot time understanding nuance subtle shift demand position probably best moment got want stick theme maybe one question google made number interesting announcement commerce shopping vertical past month including free product listing google shopping

comprehensive relevant possible basically mean need like great product best product ideally best price big selection really really important feel slightly approach really good path also allows partner bring provider like paypal shopify think actually interesting good track okay wanted turn youtube historically youtube heavily weighted brand advertising though recently seen youtube successfully implement direct response advertising offering talk strategy recent investment made attract direct response advertiser youtube platform yes actually area quite happy remember direct response youtube business basically nonexistent roughly three year ago made incredible progress one largest fastest growing ad business youtube see really interesting metric well like 60 example trueview action customer integral part direct response offering actually new youtube doubled number active advertiser using trueview action first six month 2020 lot metric really supporting happy eric sheridan philipp schindlerand see across board example player like masterclass basically took advantage opportunity see significant uplift key metric big part also remember big brand business youtube successful brand business hit hard early stage pandemic doubt really rebounded since q3 happy see impressive metric frankly look overall youtube development reached u.s. linear tv network combined

platform happy happening heading also experimenting interesting new thing better product integration youtube lot commercial intent youtube offer better shopping feature look interesting shopping surface time lot exciting stuff world got maybe turning another area broadly think pursuing prioritizing new monetization opportunity across platform early learning example monetization product like map look innovation experimentation part dna long time map good example look map 2 different way look pure utility basically help get point point b one way looking another way looking see really incredible discovery surface consumer discover lot different new world really really important think latter actually interesting path think intense let say increased monetization future also really

together discovery area improvement map think interesting area future obviously product think something announced ago discovery ad cutting across whole bunch different service surface discover feed also across youtube across gmail basically image ad seeing lot interesting development reach audience 3 billion people stay tuned one great okay wanted turn regulatory framework think regulatory privacy headwind market like u.s. example ccpa coming california impact google product perspective much impact seeing business far maybe one quick looking longer term google preparing evolving regulatory privacy landscape next couple year okay scrutiny frankly nothing new google want stay focused delivering incredible product service user number1 priority publicly said example department justice lawsuit deeply deeply ï¬‚awed people use google choose google actually choose use forced find ca find alternative integral part business focus user trust absolutely core like regulator exactly interest want protect consumer want make sure actually benefit new technology working closely regulator across world obviously take example ccpa mentioned complying actually ccpa requirement way complied gdpr requirement actually made tool system way look available across globe california take ccpa example led lot different area actively supporting advocating federal privacy legislation something heavily involved led industry come advertising privacy level transparency choice control given user time think literally get incredible amount positive feedback always trying big part strategy trying actually le data contrary many people might thinking really big focus area u also trying balance need privacy one hand need supporting broader ecosystem hand heavily eric sheridan philipp schindlerinvesting new technology really interesting thing lined new technology example called floc federated learning cohort look quite promising lot thing different development stage think
