hey great good afternoon everyone thank much joining u expected standing room name toshiya hari cover semiconductor space goldman sachs pleased honored manuvir da vp enterprise computing manuvir lead team working democratize ai bringing accelerated computing every enterprise customer 25 year experience technology industry prior joining nvidia 2019 held range senior role dell microsoft microsoft believe helped create azure platform thank much coming yeah thank toshiya honor thank everybody taking time small cog wheel happy represent nvidia question answer awesome manuvir joining nvidia 2019 successful career microsoft dell initially attracted nvidia experience company played far relative original expectation think know answer question ask anyway head enterprise computing spend time key priority q toshiya hari manuvir dasyeah three great question let think reason joined nvidia toshiya grew microsoft ultimate software platform company understood platform good application developed big focus developer fact whole thing called developer division focused developer first conversation jensen ceo chip company would talk developer really get watched keynote gtc conference previous year ceo spending three hour talking accelerated computing developer embrace build application right eye opening thing guess realized time company vision new form computing coming accelerated computing free thing take application move accelerated computing work one domain time mean need developer embrace right journey company really 25 year already could see cusp million developer using nvidia platform number reached 4 million right remarkable reason came nvidia realized people really seeing world cusp something chip whole stack second question would say experienced differently since got nvidia gone lot nvidia realized time new technology right groundbreaking people adopt way familiar adopting whole ecosystem enterprise adopt technology whether hardware manufacturer like dell hpe software platform like vmware sap service integrator like deloitte accenture spent lot time last year nvidia really getting ﬂywheel going got point think little different think third question key goal priority prioritize ..... yeah think nvidia big team people actually work talking head think two thing right one work leadership team strategy actually approach opportunity via q toshiya hari manuvir da q toshiya hari manuvir da q toshiya hari manuvir dasenterprise think second thing ecosystem talked announcement see vmware snowﬂake etcetera spend lot time working ecosystem everybody win together customer partner ecosystem course nvidia coming along great thanks jensen talk iphone moment yeah ai arriving sort outsider exposed chatgpt like yeah maybe late last year maybe earlier year depending fo stand sure saw earlier given hopefully describe aha moment broader nvidia team pertains big movement yeah think start saying firstly think world large really chatgpt aha moment right nvidia work closely openai time proud folk really every customer conversation llm generative ai first question ask looked tool kit openai provides great starting point go right done great body work right want put think u aha movement came would say probably five year probably yeah september 2019 first put first version library called megatron nvidia built really framework kind training large language model way think know year worked ai use case based called supervised learning basically teach model giving example right photograph telling car know photograph telling dog right human go process creating lot data set fed training creates bottleneck creates q toshiya hari manuvir dasand aha advent unsupervised learning think lot people learn right always learn sitting college professor teaching learn absorbing happening llm unsupervised learning put lot data front model learns right really aha movement built framework one hand called megatron training secondly realized needed different circuitry hardware call transformer really accelerate form real learning roadmap creating gpus started pulling circuitry transformer circuitry right happened year chatgpt got term customer engagement leader enterprise computing must interact thousand ten thousand big customer potential customer either already deploying ai looking way leverage technology give u feel customer engagement evolved since beginning year customer coming today yeah think start saying think 40,000 company working u technology actually meet bit challenge dramatic shift toshiya would put way right think year working company date year customer conversation would always well company care customer care pitching nvidia really many way made ai market different use case created vertical vertical depending industry show fraud detection example would good lot conversation would would say year customer come see u already know use case right intelligent assistant helping employee customer interaction conversation actually okay nvidia need know help work implement right think good point point nvidia dna platform company right work ecosystem rarely produce direct solution customer right encourage ecosystem often conversation educate landscape technology stack let show work implement right underneath everybody q toshiya hari manuvir da got term market potential ai extremely diﬃcult stand predicting big could perhaps challenging well jensen broader team throw couple number analyst day 300 billion chip system 150 billion nvidia ai enterprise software another 150 billion omniverse enterprise software guy construct something like tam go bottom top bit kind share u would helpful yeah think great topic maybe okay take couple minute unpack think important right firstly tam right talk number really talking market opportunity see play year come think go back basic fundamental thing see going toshiya new form computing beginning journey call accelerated computing right whole point think traditional computing system based cpu computing changed decade simply location cloud phone essentially style computing world evolved function company done computing mean need computing world mean need datacenters need energy need horsepower sustainable sustainable trajectory right saw accelerated computing way amount footprint 10 time work 100 time work going way simplest way thinking nvidia made big bet decade making way forward going accelerated computing okay think market opportunity fundamental level say footprint 1 trillion spend datacenters footprint already exists traditional computing plus growth going happen year ahead going shift traditional accelerated computing set nvidia forefront shift analysis market opportunity start going dramatic secular shift believe strongly ultimate killer app generative ai beginning market opportunity q toshiya hari manuvir da q toshiya hariand stuff number lot ask okay break much system hardware right refresh cycle 300 billion came software opportunity interesting thing nvidia long time invested lot software would say probably 80 r last decade software hardware software come along hardware reason lot early shift develop ecosystem researcher r need software sort okay go pain adopting software moving world production moving world enterprise company betting business ai model running application need software reason put number software see incrementally nvidia year ahead big opportunity actually operating system ai ai model take run application model need running 3 morning right need supported thing nvidia provider time matter incremental software opportunity come u one hand take secular shift believe secular shift driven nvidia big opportunity u hand look individual part stack add got sound like still feel pretty good number timing think think realize generational change transition industry going go long haul yeah got got csps sophisticated informed field enterprise sure pretty broad range term sophistication guy quite bit democratize ai think got framework got partnership like snowﬂake vmware hugging face maybe talk significance partnership make easier customer deploy ai manuvir da yeah thingi work think every day toshiya think couple different aspect democratizing right think first thing need really understand power large language model llm democratization think understand value right see every day use chatgpt see generative ai generating image every day think different way thinking right thing ai new form computing basically corpus data train model corpus data learned ask question sound great challenge year first part process high bar entry find data right data curate go whole training process get usable model right beautiful thing large language model thing called foundation model right smaller set people done work hundred million dollar server large amount data trained model ready use right start fine tune data use model whole front end process done right barrier entry work customer certainly ai unicorn sitting large amount training every industry company say forefront going train giant model right like bloomberg great example think bread butter enterprise customer great place start let pick one foundation model right whether somebody like openai llama 2 meta nvidia model ultimate democratization front end process diﬃcult basically jump ahead right start output fine tuning inference embed application think technology level one kind demonetization right work see one ecosystem level example made announcement vmware recently saying one enterprise company want jump sort 75 point take model embed application well need need able take model put briefcase take wherever application need right need vmware called private ai basically empowered pick model right use tool right q toshiya hari manuvir dasi already farm server deployed vmware team already know manage right scale right work people big transformation deployment contract deloitte contract accenture right certain software platform use ultimate level democratization example work servicenow talked right ultimate democratization ai work enterprise company know ai know working nvidia upgraded newer version servicenow infused ai work nvidia servicenow together point view got new functionality right put another way platform company believe network network u ultimate democratization ai nvidia going ecosystem application powered nvidia platform network customer company individually sale team sale team right taking nvidia technology customer really journey great dgx cloud couple question think recently introduced concept dgx cloud level audience describe dgx cloud come together work one question often get investor actually end competing customer address concern would great start saying intention competing csps fact best partner right among best partner lot business together work lot customer get mutually csps right think simplest way explain would think server system built called dgx right worked many year accelerating computing new kind paradigm okay chip system networking software everything go started journey system manufacturer dell hp world sold certain kind system customer expected procure certain kind system manufacturer really accelerated computing built system sort show way scout team right established dgx use case helped system manufacturer understand new computing model actually interesting market soon realized market actually took secret sauce dgx actually took internals productized engineered q toshiya hari manuvir da q toshiya hari manuvir dassolution gave system manufacturer said go sell system system ip sell actually happy sell one system customer going scale business dgx dgx scout team right always innovating putting next stuff way came dgx cloud exactly thought process cloud see customer work cloud especially ai journey said csps within cloud mutually create footprint nvidia dgx technology putting footprint next step computing right need networking storage quite intertwined computer single computer whole set server datacenter worked put footprint customer come experienced latest engaged advance expectation fact csps watch operation say okay thank much nvidia scaling got right really good outcome everybody customer csps ph jensen make statement want best sale team csps like system manufacturer right think see okay make sense seems like response far positive yeah think great relationship working csps keen expand footprint okay got mean talked dgx work system partner definitely want go recently introduced l40s gpu maybe spend couple minute describing significance l40s system business oem business gone know important route enterprise well think know realized got point accelerated computing system manufacturer mainstream product line eventually point product line accelerated computing nvidia l40s really saying two world separate world anymore mainstream server line every server gpu think datacenters headed q toshiya hari manuvir dasi want say toshiya know ask thing make nvidia special okay build gpus one architecture one programming model based cuda mean see market able produce family gpus different situation programmed way developer ecosystem different thing l40s okay know hopper generation h100 high demand right obviously working certain way chip packaged system packaged beauty l40s really good workﬂow talked inﬂuence course training really go constructed way right requirement process hopper family right creates another channel supply kind computing infrastructure everything designed fit standard server form factor power consumption journey announced dell hpe lenovo number several manufacturer think 100 odd system coming online customer say tech refreshing datacenters know rack stack right standard server rack stack put one server gpu reason many different use case whether ai data processing plethora use case save money one server much single cpu server right adding secular movement step back say look inside datacenter today see many server typical datacenter today gpu single digit percentage right expect see year road majority server gpus getting right system l40s process like one part working developer ecosystem 4 million developer domain move domain accelerated computing different use case mean journey right think guy extremely dominant training think competitive setup landscape inference little bit nuanced something like l40s sound like effective addressing inference market yeah think course hardware proud chip innovate chip rapid fashion standing body work right hardware developed time circuitry remember 80 software company software hardware team work conjunction right reason h100 well deep q toshiya hari q unidentified participant manuvir daslearning llm inference software team nvidia forefront figuring actually want chip right allows build right chip right inference clear u many year training lead inference right two movement going okay one hand understand training thing okay happens train model model good data trained reality running business getting new data every day training clear right training done continuously big company going call ai factory basically training time clearly useful using model application inference spent last year really designing hardware especially software stack inference right think big opportunity going forward said every place inference one pick take briefcase along model today run model want run datacenter colo public cloud choice to2 csp workstation pc one world take work anywhere nvidia software runtime inference right hardware opportunity software opportunity really fascinating going pause see guess one person mics room check first thank first congratulation success struck comment nvidia positioning operating system ai application given given support openai responsibility think company like nvidia make certain ai used way kind service offer customer care ability audit result make certain result put multiple speaker great question like fact use word responsibility responsible ai think thing right platform company right job provide foundational technology think two way right first way point view company deploying ai empower run ai way want right make portable q unidentified participant manuvir dasand produce software stack take right run ai building premise compliance regime right data sitting certain place instead making come ai bring ai right one part second part hardware work confidential computing got latest generation hardware think model ip right model software protect model deployed running done work hardware create confidential computing world ai one aspect tooling provide software tool like technology called guardrail allows control model actually question answer control much hallucination get use model right think one part aspect responsible ai start data right ip model actually came data data coming sourced right people actually contributed data getting economic credit producing data work company like getty image shutterstock licensed content right nvidia enabling create model generative ai based data set sourced responsibly right example work wpp company advertising realm able reliably take output model built getty shutterstock etcetera knowing get asset using campaign complete knowledge came responsibly sourced right think aspect data coming responsibly sourced think many aspect general one company ecosystem certainly big focus nvidia hi talk inference opportunity nvidia opposed training would share inference maybe three year versus training share great question noticed generally philosophically company think 25 share something 40 share something think view simple computer server workstation going forward position used inference believe working best hardware software stack inference answer q toshiya hari manuvir da q toshiya hari manuvir da wanted squeeze supply question best place end wanted squeeze secret mismatch today guess significant mismatch extent quantify head enterprise computing plan business supply tight gpus point would expect meet yeah great question interesting one end would say firstly said yes definitely see demand supply talked earnings racing increase supply think partner supply chain done exceptional job working u increase supply talked l40s minute ago also found way increase supply way think process multiple quarter year think good thing customer one hand journey put new footprint datacenters take multiple quarter meanwhile part increase supply next quarter think sort natural balance two thing sit tell exactly going happen think feel pretty good fact taken step increase supply meanwhile customer journey see sort happening conjunction go said secular shift right something focused one quarter sure sure guess last 60 second obviously playing big growing market core everything anything missed conversation anything want highlight group let go think main thing point zoom enough right know focused llm generative ai killer application really seeing right coming fruition finally move new computing platform world really needed accelerated computing large language model generative ai killer app convincing everybody adopt platform adopt platform going much effect workload like data processing normally traditional computing going accelerated dramatically footprint going able 10 time amount work 100 time amount work could existing footprint q toshiya hari manuvir dastoday important saving money energy footprint world cusp truly excited nvidia see opportunity going forward conﬂuence two thing need right application really drive people new platform open opportunity new platform provides right really looking going forward amazing really enjoyed conversation congratulation everything thank much really appreciate time thank thank time
