accessed terminal bi go pas crystal guide u rest presentation great thank much anurag technical diﬃculty going advance first couple slide okay good morning everyone thanks joining crystal valentine going start today giving brief framework think helpful analyze lot market trend seeing especially emergence new technology new paradigm enterprise computing mean legacy technology vendor thinking company whether secular tailwind headwind hope framework useful large picture seeing really remarkable fundamental shift way enterprise thinking spending money technology go type shift transformation every 30 year generation look macro picture global technology spend 1.5 trillion excluding telco device grows relatively rate gdp growth primarily ﬂat break technology spending constituent component differentiate spending technology versus legacy technology see two different story taking place technology inclusive cloud computing infrastructure well sort art ph infrastructure technology growing contrast legacy technology investment slowing growth actually starting shrink actually pas inﬂection point year ago 2015 actually see decline growth core asset legacy technology company technology perspective think explain shift opportunity save money using cheaper infrastructure cheaper device instead something much fundamental taking place still couple trend pretty well studied well understood point converging create shift first one rapid growth commercially available computing power familiar trend known moore law especially referring essentially power commercially available transistor number calculation per second per dollar basis commercially available market double approximately every 18 month equates 40 compounded annual growth rate chart show growth inaudible scale actually includes upper right nvidia gpu chip precipitating continuing trajectory know moore law time massive acceleration volume data collected analyzed enterprise study mckinsey estimated 1987 three exabyte data whereas projecting forward 2020 looking 44 zettabyte data 44,000 exabyte data course data volume growing phenomenon also well studied also see increasing diversity data type collecting longer structured crm erp data set large enterprise collecting growing instead largely coming unstructured source weblogs sensor data high definition video beep audio file et cetera data volume growing enormous rate even complicated diverse data type third trend somewhat problematic relative first two trend growth computing power growth data collected fundamentally storage access speed i/o speed lagged growing modest much modest rate 20 compounded annual growth rate compared 40 compounded annual growth rate competition speed growing today commercially available hard disk drive even ssd drive achieve 550 megabyte per second i/o speed mean time take read write data persistence storage memory processor fact fastest data speed get using example aws 500 megabyte per second fastest i/o speed achieve commercially compute gone faster data volume increased storage density gotten greater cheaper storage access data right meant fact data storage data access bottleneck motivated shift architecture legacy world saw predominantly known architecture would multiple application potentially running thing like relational database would accessing data stored san traditional na storage device array bottleneck would controller controller device multiple application trying access shared data storage device essentially data i/o speed became fundamental bottleneck order transcend bottleneck seen shift architecture synonymous large idea running application instead large cluster sometimes thousand commodity linux server inclusive infrastructure technology thing like platform well public cloud infrastructure service also architecture benefit leveraging architecture commodity linux server relatively inexpensive able parallelize fundamental bottleneck data access computation data storage distributed across large cluster node meaning processor parallel read local storage device i/o parallelize across size cluster architecture helped overcome i/o bottleneck mentioned also benefit running relatively inexpensive commodity hardware fundamentally done change value data mean known time value data value able analyze data order optimize business showing left legacy value model data look orange curve top simply demonstrating notion go data data quite valuable going data incrementally data add value point though reach law large number get diminishing return adding incremental value curve ﬂattens going towards right however using legacy architecture fundamentally exponentially growing soft curve cost storage managing data grew exponentially amount data management green curve net value value minus cost upside curve simple calculation find curve maximum anurag ranaoptimum value optimum volume data manage order extract value data without incurring higher cost today leveraging infrastructure infrastructure orange curve value data changed changed cost curve managing storing data cost slowly growing linear function size data management indeed case going exabyte data management two exabyte data management roughly double cost infrastructure required manage data different net curve value minus cost optimal value optimal volume data store manage order extract value much right much larger volume data really leverage benefit company final thought think world term believe axiomatically true axiom think true least today data essential disruptive application know data leverage point gaining competitive advantage disruptive company business model built application second data volume continuing grow part data shifting value model shifting value curve data architecture fundamental finally existing technology today see data movement data access performance bottleneck certain implication meaning solution architecture minimize amount data need moved order application perform going going better one require large data movement whether network whether i/o data access movement persistent storage main memory computer pause concludes overview transition portion question answer thanks crystal one thing mentioned area next area development could form ai machine learning look infrastructure company today talk whether new workload versus legacy company older business model way think world eventually evolve whether going public cloud model private cloud model hybrid cloud model envision legacy technology spending mentioned 1.5 trillion envision shaping let say next 3 5 10 year crystal valentine anurag rana sure think legacy technology primarily characterized deployment indeed secular decline think public cloud infrastructure offering offer performance well economic benefit least term company seeing though different rate adoption depending size company analyzing small company extent company well le technological baggage potentially le made fewer investment large legacy deployment therefore easier rapidly adopt cloud needed technology embrace strategy larger enterprise fortune 500 company large bank telecom et cetera different calculus typically made decade worth investment legacy technology whether data warehousing project legacy etl software investment expensive embedding decade business logic straightforward refactor existing software technology shift public cloud offering straightforward path example teradata customer leverage teradata cloud something personally would categorize true technology fact legacy technology simply managed service offering think larger enterprise longer journey public cloud also becoming savvy idea cloud vendor consideration coming mind larger company thinking ten ph sometimes longer time horizon future want understand relationship azure aws google going look like going impact business going forward also make another note believe lot conversation growth public cloud infrastructure missing one critical aspect true growth public cloud computing fast accelerating actually estimated around 16 19 compounded annual growth rate lower 35 compounded annual growth rate growth data volume large part reason public cloud growing slower data volume think would little bit closer simply lot data processing actually occurring edge edge device thing like connected car even lesser known technology like smart jet engine new jet engine example generate 36 terabyte data per engine hour enormous volume data generated processed edge never make way public cloud infrastructure important keep mind fairly amazing perhaps start peeling public hybrid area maybe move edge computing look crystal valentine anurag rana crystal valentineat take look legacy bank said lot baggage deal strategically best option mean move portion workload public cloud move critical application refactor go hybrid cloud strategy one example aws vmware together pitching microsoft pitching oracle pitching sitting bank would mindset would strategic direction would take yeah great question fact asked question long ago cio chief information oﬃcer large u bank based new york question exactly future data think cloud viable location place data motivation behind question cognizant fact cloud data gravity data cloud becomes inaudible plenty reason want go hassle moving data belief cloud vendor actually charge move data cloud question think cloud 10 year relationship azure aws going look like every hear story large customer actually hit inﬂection point decide leave cloud altogether data center take volume data management great cloud longer economically viable option response question strategy make sense try develop application way actually resilient change cost unexpected interruption relationship particular cloud vendor develop known application run aws azure google could even leverage combination public cloud infrastructure set position optionality going forward shoot shift compute data consumption public cloud vendor data center price consideration dictate crystal one thing mentioned data charge coming lately lot discussion industry contact perhaps give u little detail enlighten u also heard isv trying figure vendor go depending data charged perhaps even give u little bit basic cloud vendor charging data leaf come data center anything around would interesting sure yeah complicated actually make estimate much going spending decide deploy application example aws azure complex analysis function many different factor real way know project much going spending actually run benchmark actually deploy application cloud check see monthly bill look like extrapolate factor go determining paying cloud course combination amount volume data storage different tier storage capability offer different i/o speed different slas guarantee different price attached also charge per virtual machine per instance essentially unit computation unit computing power leveraging different pricing model well either use sort reserve certain instance exclusive use yearly basis data movement actually one hardest task understand example within aws many different geographical call geographical region throughout world reason would optionality choose geographical region would like leverage building cloud application actually different price different geographical region depending supply demand challenge one main drive ph leveraging public cloud infrastructure truly global application right large bank example customer europe well north america would love able minimize latency time take customer interacting website atm time take data leave application atm make public cloud minimum actually want leverage combination geographical region combination example north america european region challenge moving data region inevitably happen trying aggregate across customer example talking money ph fee essentially tool moving data geographical region sometimes even tool essentially moving data public cloud back data center many sort hidden fee suﬃciently complex application really diﬃcult get head around total cost going amazon also example number sort homegrown tool offer customer one different fee associated particularly think surprise lot people example amazon data warehousing product known redshift mean inexpensive tends large expense customer choose leverage course problem reminiscent problem legacy data warehouse anurag rana crystal valentine anurag rana yeah mean one interesting thing seeing public cloud growth gone people trying realizing cheap written guess marketed begs think way look public cloud infrastructure built way provides high amount scalability agility thing legacy infrastructure lagged sometimes think large bank thinking future wo want create private cloud exact similar specification aws look like try meter internally different department different area way like would public cloud never worried issue hard create network much revenue many employee make sense try yeah know exactly precisely would hazard guess see least foreseeable future fortune 500 company maintain organization infrastructure system essentially annihilate agility usability public cloud infrastructure option number reason partially cost point right economics deploying really huge volume data public cloud start fall apart partially also security especially within financial service see lot conservatism around embracing public cloud application sensitive customer data sure going much size company age company going see company relatively new relatively young still would consider large consumer data embrace public cloud way sort larger bank fortune 500 type company would talking company like netﬂix uber embrace architecture paradigm beginning large extent said ability innovate rapidly infrastructure offered public cloud fundamentally different paradigm developing application enables agility public cloud infrastructure agile fundamentally different way writing application type company even though huge data deployment embraced largely benefit becomes much easier add new feature functionality integrate modern technology like machine learning artificial intelligence embraced modern application architecture includes leveraging public cloud crystal valentine anurag rana crystal valentineso case one interesting would say example came across u recently dropbox mean started life aws private cloud saw profitability improved mean part due shift could model others follow say hey pharma company lot data transfer region area might create network rather using public cloud source think depends core competency company investigation dropbox somewhat unique fundamentally offering storage service fundamental offering storage service job operator optimize cost storing behalf customer company much interactive sophisticated application company like uber netﬂix many others really benefiting much sophisticated feature functionality fact application writing still much sophisticated dropbox running really competitive advantage able leverage machine learning train model quickly deploy model production quickly whereas dropbox leverage certain modern paradigm like machine learning much much lesser extent think dropbox somewhat special case yeah fair enough another thing touched upon presentation edge computing another would say driver could lead modernization legacy infrastructure view today think going lot data get generated edge make back public cloud reminds kind old client server world really company going use lot sensor lot computing endpoint might well private cloud network lot processing power endpoint kind take marriage private public cloud particular case one size decision iot application think give another visual relative growth data generated process edge first within data center abstract sort contextual drawing talked growth data approximately 35 compounded annual growth rate break data growing within data center public cloud data generated process edge see two different story edge growing point much much faster even size consumer internet data generated car autonomous driving vehicle generated three four terabyte data per vehicle hour said even compared example pratt whitney geared turbofan engine anurag rana crystal valentinegenerate 36 terabyte data per engine hour data actually largely never making public private data center data largely generated vehicle plane looking anomaly looking problem helping make decision small percentage data aggregated sent back data center subsequent retrospective analysis decision letter leverage public private cloud infrastructure developing iot application really depends nature application sensitive example security concern latency issue primary concern latency particularly important application might either multiple private data center around world might leverage multiple different geographical region within public cloud infrastructure one example cool thanks quick reminder question please type address crystal one thing talk lot lot marketing hype around around ai think ai mean think evolution tied public cloud platform mean really want good really need aws and/or google kind structure could premise world thought kind leading race point mean envision standalone operation standalone application occurs going embedded application people building compare different platform first take initial take yeah obviously artificial intelligence machine learning massive secular trend today cloud vendor trying develop tool platform leverage cloud infrastructure machine learning application example tool available public cloud either open source meaning deployed well deployed cloud really interesting far pretty rudimentary tool offered example aws acer google actually probably sophisticated one time largely open source rudimentary tool public cloud vendor making available incentivize net new application implemented leveraging infrastructure course use tool going likely rely apis therefore lock particular public file vendor foreseeable future practice sophisticated machine learning application leveraged enterprise talking thing like deep learning model go autonomous driving even machine learning model anurag rana crystal valentine anurag ranago making recommendation netﬂix leveraging cloud branded tool typically much homegrown leveraging open source software highly customized order anything particularly interesting disruptive end hire team expert team phd write highly customized code way sort cookie cutter public file vendor offering date offering relatively low featured cookie cutter tool help really basic machine learning application think probably see continuation merger acquisition amazon azure google particular acquire company building tool framework enable sophisticated machine learning application development today clear compelling reason leverage one side another think within academia google cloud tends little bit preferred within trying build cloud native application use machine learning aws tends little bit preferred course azure preferred existing microsoft customer experience ibm watson working thing much longer industry expertise client base experience thought yes watson would tell call cognitive computing true artificial intelligence rather old technology fact watson fundamentally known question answering machine requires enormous amount annual annotation input data typically text corpus watson creates semantic math semantic model entity relationship observed within text trained semantic model representation able answer question though relative fundamentally somewhat rudimentary least legacy use could loosely called machine learning excite particularly technological standpoint particularly challenging implement process public instance watson fail produce valuable insight even significant investment including md anderson implemented assist cancer patient treatment watson particularly interesting promising technology interesting assessment thank one thing mentioned microsoft discussion lot look legacy world hard define call vmware shop microsoft shop closer oracle sap see new world evolving prone go one cloud provider given legacy baggage frankly matter matter much money willing spend relationship company crystal valentine anurag rana crystal valentine yeah seeing different sale strategy cloud vendor advantage microsoft think one reason seen strong growth azure company truly hybrid solution obviously existing microsoft customer idea working known vendor appealing addition actually offer hybrid cloud environment customer mean combination competition within private customer private data center well azure public cloud infrastructure leveraging really similar technology cloud customer similar experience developing running application cloud leverage varying infrastructure different motivation including cost security consideration amazon kind presence speak therefore particularly challenging time approaching larger enterprise real requirement around maintaining mission critical legacy application deployed year year also historically different strategy microsoft azure microsoft sale rep motivated fact compensated based consumption cloud resource cloud compute resource selling compute capacity actually motivating customer consume cloud compute storage resource sold rep compensated motivated work much closely partner isv partner whose software would consume large amount resource azure cloud aws taken strategy think might changing within aws 100 sure certainly azure much stronger proponent isv partner aws aws partner company somewhat tenuous relationship aws fair well crystal question point delight listening insight hope sometime big thanks listener thanks thank
