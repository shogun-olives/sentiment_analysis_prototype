right cloud big thing microsoft specifically broad definition cloud cloud asset frankly kind give preview starting productivity cloud oﬃce 365 everything actual oﬃce application delivered live service well collaboration skype team anything communication collaboration productivity oﬃce 365 cloud went business application unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia whitedynamic 365 line business crm field service type technology course core platform infrastructure azure able app innovation thing like data cortana intelligence well deep data artificial intelligence capability last least course actually whole cloud security management portfolio well u cloud comprehensive productivity line business infrastructure security data okay helpful thank look back guy different fiscal calendar however want think last 12 month biggest surprise surprised cloud business think cloud technology advancement well market honestly developing expected like tax disruption ca think big surprise interesting thing biggest think surprise u political situation going across globe maybe uk u pending italy germany actually material impact cloud conversation customer term data residing data center think access privacy data handling conversation coming based think u consider somewhat surprising political situation sign take away take step back political situation sign think people cloud become mainstream starting get question customer might removing beyond say custom dev actually starting hear people think plan bigger migration also potentially behind type question sure people think phase early cycle dev/test kind finding new mobile apps cloud really thinking holistic data center migration cloud looking application sensitive line business data core thing topic become central interesting oﬃce 365 mature commercial cloud offering early day people like obviously archiving different thing started saying going run entire productivity stack cloud question matured well think seeing similar cycle infrastructure holistic data center side point unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia whiteso would say going sound crazy specific technology around cloud around aws started little decade ago beyond mean people tech company moved today sheer started cloud still mainstream corporation talk still people limited cloud strategy point mainstream everyone kind staff basis thinking production workload might custom built starting move would say mainstream conversation planning average even laggard technology organization strategy think look mainstream actual cloud adoption infrastructure platform perspective sense long take move like conversation mainstream conversation mainstream deployment yes technologist would want go lot faster live little bubble everything quickly technology done commercial enterprise technology 20 year always slower technologist want mean think think year year actually end 2016 year 50 percentage mainstream organization felt cloud security superior getting 50 thought inferior hit conversation think think five year forward think start seeing good mainstream core line application kind broad adoption begun real way trying temper mean people used tell edi going away know mainframe still 2 million business let practical term going go curve going shape customer wish list security top priority customer wish list else would unidentified participant julia whiteyes security always look thing people care cloud security still number one become le we’ve seen privacy rising one think thing talk customer mainstream company technology living knowhow use cloud digital transformation make cloud easier innovating quickly u microsoft thousand new capability coming ge manufacturing company auto manufacturer trying keep hard knowing take advantage thing like make transition data center cloud much smoother assume everything going go cloud overnight deep investment hybrid way hybrid uniquely continuity two deeply understand data center well cloud uniquely able make something customer way make sense think migration certainly top mind think already conversation even political domain really focusing call trust trust principle privacy security compliance transparency making sure kind cutting edge area know even business policy political situation change trust cloud ready business use good segue given said helping make transition smoother think competitive environment cloud today differentiated could go little bit deeper yes think past couple year bit feature war look cloud feature actually closing gap feature think point feature aided feature whatever like feature war people actually get business outcome cloud think real pivot talking mean massive sale force every day talking digital transformation conversation customer want u digital transformation use text ph get new business outcome get think holistically differentiation question one holistic cloud microsoft cloud azure oﬃce 365 dynamic 365 thing get coherence lot oﬃce 365 customer want running collaboration stack think already done identity system use ph azure already set already gone security audit type thing front unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participanthybrid definitely major conversation key differentiator microsoft understand data center understand cloud hybrid today people use different way thing infrastructure data center infrastructure cloud basically organization running two infrastructure consistent right le expense security come play trying manage two thing complex reality like everything go cloud overnight done uniquely consistent hybrid approach one directory system one identity system whether thing cloud one management security platform whether thing data center cloud final stage launching consistent platform azure stack actually speaking technology public cloud azure putting small instantiation customer put data center it’s inaudible azure give data center control developer build application using cpi writing application decide run azure stack data center azure cloud consistent experience going run sql server workload aws would feature would available product would available azure stack azure stack correct mean azure stack well guess could use aws azure stack would little silly honest right getting benefit sheer developer experience technology customer access much much innovation like selling point going talking customer like said starting year journey could say look work u selling process could 1 encapsulating stand mean like think selling motion type new product might help ease someone concerned making best move cloud julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant yes absolutely mean acknowledging say technology thing actually major change organization recently meeting cio across different government agency asked single reason cloud adoption faster said organization that’s human technology quite mature level change really understanding use cloud versus exact thing data center cloud really taking advantage cloud still deep fear organization go cloud mean job human job keep coming play go conversation fully recognizes change initiative say know change way need go whatever pace want hence investment hybrid leveraging utilizing best massive existing data center infrastructure investment walk away like pull truck inaudible use advantage use cloud intelligently innovate connect way mean running two different environment expensive creates security issue comfortable process people way think sale force going talking large customer incented one way another person incented differently drive cloud business holistic approach matter kind bucket falling couple thing though shifted cloud business adjusted way incentivize sale force part overall company change old day technology sale people paid license license got paid whether customer use problem decided sale people got paid cloud though increasingly shifted sale people role dedicated consumption amount paid consumption versus transaction moving significant sale force focus getting paid customer actually consumes cloud service right giving value need reality cloud service customer using look leave every day recognize julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia whitewhen think incremental revenue opportunity someone could take act running trading application sql server decide migrate azure people think incremental revenue opportunity could go microsoft migrating wondering way think wethink look overall shape investment paying physical data center paying air conditioning energy expensive asset actually global scale 38 data center region anyone else planet incredible economy scale pas customer say well actually get bigger share wallet term running end end beyond heating cooling space incremental upsell people move cloud mean technology frankly possible frankly pragmatically possible instantiation machine learning artificial intelligence one example thing could amount infrastructure took could double could try app experiment massive putting huge upfront cost going uber three month loaded new apps driver facial recognition make sure actually driver took upfront cost wrote cognitive service facial recognition part app went globally three month type thing fundamentally mean could try premise multiple speaking cloud adoption customer typically evolve initial used case guess mentioned oﬃce 365 biggest enterprise cloud offering software customer typically get first taste using microsoft cloud evolve oﬃce 365 mean sa market multiple speaker mature little bit people kind conceptually understood hosted mail personal life never one ever hand unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia whitetheir personal email refer model understandable company go level something like could go market reason well fact oﬃce 365 started many many year ago conﬂuence play customer tend begin cloud journey think look done set directory system wake done definitely ﬂow common increasingly maturity cloud think opportunity supplied rival ph term kind ph using cloud mainstream way past adoption evolving right people start would say momentum past adoption yes think people familiar right advanced service azure ad service going technical diﬃculty seeing strong growth think continue mean technical diﬃculty growth faster think people see thing like described uber facial recognition instantly added app service higher level service advanced service create think could data center start recognize let pause second see got whole host question want see audience get new mic think mic’s good right going keep going anyone question feel free jump look five year 10 year said technologist want happen faster maybe could percentage workload would get would cloud microsoft view view technologist five year unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participantfive ten year fix timeframe different hope yes kidding feeling kind think depending research report look digit getting double digit today think five year eclipsing 30 think double end think actually linear curve versus steeper mean think part set back camera big right 1.6 trillion think everything logged little thoughtful term big cam think going jumped think going massive amount front mentioned availability data center space maybe space region covering anybody else think given data center also serve oﬃce 365 right serving globe product think utilization versus competitor utilization given region cover given breadth product offering taking longer get utilization level would like see inside data center think reason anyone else done put data sensor country people data need handling thing matter supply chain perspective got incredibly tight get signal point actually production center expansion one one microsoft one largest sale force planet vast number signal knowing exactly pipeline look like kind capacity need build pretty early part pipeline get pretty good sense done massive amount work given decade consumer service thing number week signal production pretty high think multiple speaker brings another question inaudible people believe microsoft ca operate scale aws way cast designed know whether myth whether reality certainly something get discussed investment community wondering could share thought belief julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white idea satya phil absoluteness 100 term think skype oﬃce 365 consumer service scale global also overall capacity perspective ad powering vast majority underneath year think know nothing technology perspective would suggest scale think many place believe cost microsoft much scalable ew oka question keep going quiet shy group today unusual great job used cio sort aws still place take existing window deployment run seen given tremendous growth seen azure seen shift used hey going take window run aws started shift would always start cloud existing window workload versus maybe three four year ago yes think look run rate get disproportionate share based technology share increasing last year strong consistently strong would say mapped whether gotten better know definitely strong continuing time see want clear think myth around azure solve linux workload open source workload right sort rbms growing think people really started hear take heed really believe investment open source technology truth term well run open source partnership struck red hat example uniquely partnership red hat tier 1 support joint customer one else different thing like investment container kind next generation application model many open source leader world actually microsoft mean recent report github number one contributor open source project ahead google ahead facebook azure support around open source also microsoft overall commitment contribution open source helping set people mind around place open source support well unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia whitehow committee typically bought building first aws last year even last 12 month change see company building business azure think area need bigger focus company anything share u yes mean microsoft investment done lot around working incubator like commentator across globe coming commentator blast cohort seeing half using azure half using aws increase past understand program get.com great example step walmart startup cloud 100 based azure seeing nice win front think always place aws started aws oriented sort thing make sense early got first base run think seeing making good sense var community kind whole cloud thing kind changed business model ton help continue mean lot inﬂuence customer help continue level inﬂuence type investment change made term support yes made conversation partner ecosystem le sometimes customer term mean eight year ago started workshop partner mean become service provider versus service implementer mean p l perspective make money thing always partner company 90 commercial revenue go partner changing term went partner front model cloud able call cloud service provider program essentially reseller license maybe implementation afterwards equivalent thing cloud ask add service top versus transactor cloud service world expectation ecosystem different giving understandable clear way make ongoing revenue cloud service build new business top unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia whitethat place continue invest making sure ecosystem grows microsoft kind dna always believed financially maybe going back differentiation question think important one made past even like six month number conversation partner like aws partner think going pat back going dna still core microsoft believe satya talk lot ai company build sustainable competitive advantage simple thing moonshot time really paid laid new technology fabric called fpga gate array basically way get processing speed silicon actually many year ago started project fully lined entire cloud new technology let assume incredible new ultrafast processing capability unique differentiator take anyone near even started journey talked way done incredibly unique differentiated term thinking massive turnkey power wire video analysis type thing unique infrastructure already put market also intelligence graph microsoft graph looking different activity correlation going thing oﬃce 365 intelligence security graph looking different security signal different cloud let u view different thing perspective pretty unique position term insight put utilize artificial intelligence way different graph well fundamental cloud infrastructure put place put u strong position frankly okay last question sitting 12 month goal would expect cloud business achieved year well way hitting 20 billion cloud metric laid top sure ai area would clear leader artificial intelligence capability customer actually realizing production ai versus dreaming unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white operatoryou think see production ai workload next year think okay yes real practical way think see really good closure gap ia space azure aws term closing mean closing term overall market share okay right thank julia thank much thanks everybody coming thank question answer question
