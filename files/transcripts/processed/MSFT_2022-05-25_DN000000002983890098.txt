collaboration solution security compliance mark murphyand think thing got right early really trying work customer get make transition cloud term choose go cloud decade ago others hybrid whether user moved cloud stayed pram ph workload moved cloud five year ago really took step back felt way one thing cloud economy scale economy skill microsoft took upon actually keep customer updated integrated got customer version product enabled lot new scenario allowed u create something like microsoft team would never able create something like microsoft team classic world cloud customer base line different infrastructure team took step back said apps device people group bring sync async communication collab together security compliance knew area needed investment system record system engagement started come together knew invest automation power platform guess would say mark thing taken stayed word productivity taken broader broader perspective oﬃce initially information worker even information worker go back oﬃce way back people thought saturated oﬃce creation word excel ph creation collaboration communication security compliance automation stop information worker 80 worker planet worker worker company go digital transformation worker incredibly important productivity gone information worker knowledge worker worker small business tam one thing productivity think addressable market continue grow addressable market creation tool collaboration tool security compliance think employee experience productivity especially hybrid world come together incredibly excited stay know journey define productivity individual level team level org level amazing vision rajesh look back march quarter aggregate microsoft solid quarter came raised forecast oﬃce contrast many

take inclusively look productivity final item say talked usage usage never higher usage customer see opted renewal lesser discounting thing like e5 premier tier bring together customer early day seeing play installed base aperture broader billion information worker right go well beyond mentioned e5 wanted touch moment sense much value packed skus e3 e5 speculation e7 coming point think process packing value skus monetizing say know last year said 8 installed base commercial oﬃces installed base moved e5 like still early remember know talking information worker like said aim go broader smb worker role offering mix e5 play time depends flws probably e5 user information worker quite early still cycle value term value e5 agree mean lot customer customer choose get bundle choose get security offering compliance offering phone system offering analytics offering choose get separately think value taken together customer e5 skus many actually want get entire suite incredible value rajesh team part incredible value rajesh jha mark murphy rajesh jha yeah couple year ago satya described team believe said fastest growing app seen step back thinking pretty big statement right oﬃce grew quickly loop ph grew quickly exchange grew quickly earlier year believe said team crossed 270 million monthly active right far behind oﬃce 365 commercial seat view significance team step back say put u historical context u team experience would say fundamentally different competing product world great question mark mean oﬃce around oﬃce business long time would say team remarkable

platform ecosystem transcends given device isv even microsoft like creating thing like microsoft viva application team write application microsoft team application run window mac web mobile device io angular servicenow workday adobe monday.com lot lot isvs fact take look number custom application built microsoft team two year ago grown 10x ecosystem real differentiation team ecosystem also play device side poly logitech zebra mark murphy rajesh jha mark murphy rajesh jhaand folk building device optimized microsoft team operator connecting backplane microsoft backplane customer want microsoft team phone collaboration conferencing configuration go feel base line differentiated point view space company space evolves team room phone system evolves employee experience evolves yeah team truly special said tool find yeah team phone finding lot people help u understand strategy far ambition stretching team phone would think scale specific opportunity yeah know mean see interesting seems obvious phone course make sense anchored desk anymore especially hybrid work phone got around individual got around person desk lot customer want get legacy pbx system something much setup hydro world

call want bring whiteboard want able bring shared screen sharing actually communicate quickly think blending phone offering whether whether inside organization whether across organization see broad demand phone across different industry shape size 80 million people use team phone different ﬂavours thing exciting time value customer decide get legacy pbxs phone system time value week week get configured backplane team multimodal configured team configured directory add phone question week year making mark murphy rajesh jhaso hugely cost effective ﬂexible multimodal think real differentiated perspective regarding ph phone look oﬃce 365 purchased 45 purchase microsoft 365 think people audience would probably think microsoft 365 set finished application service heard refer basically rich developer platform alluded foundation underneath microsoft graph ﬂuid framework way help make tangible kind audience try explain differentiation think really important point mark mean microsoft 365 set finished service sure customer whether creativity solution productivity collab want get really quick first foremost also platform microsoft sound ph build every single productivity application project management application team set platform like earlier talked find zoom team store find ringcentral team store going find sort project management whiteboard company team store ux layer alone ui layer platform people really customer choice end day even ux layer team platform data layer call data layer microsoft graph satya said think right characterization microsoft graph important database company database company employee work meeting document shared document trending know project deadline different people database microsoft run massive amount ai give insight deep
