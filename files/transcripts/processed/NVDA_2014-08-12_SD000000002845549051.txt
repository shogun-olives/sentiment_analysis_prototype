okay great well thank joining u afternoon name mike mcconnell lead semiconductor analyst pacific crest pleased afternoon chris evenden investor relation nvidia representing company usual kick q always encourage audience participation hopefully hit key topic interested let get started chris maybe talk little bit company gross margin think opinion two driver behind stock performance last year one definitely gross margin expansion close already record high kind talk reason driving margin expansion think sustainable think opportunity even higher gross margin yes good question record q2 record high significant margin q2 come higher anticipated couple reason tesla storming quarter tegra bit lighter expected combined give u high q2 even broader picture lot higher growing gross margin steadily two year think way mid high 50 good place mix right also transition business component chip platform business mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnellso look value add market value lot chip fact geforce quadro tesla grid physically piece silicon thing different software ecosystem build around produce really 3d driver got geforce got gaming gpu consumer optimize professional application shedloads capability testing stability testing got quadro dominant market share workstation space build cuda ecosystem parallel programming ecosystem arrange university train ten thousand people program parallel code hardware got tesla really platform actually software engineer hardware engineer think key value margin going much able grow margin business particularly quadro tesla grid refer option growth look like going great business proof point yet trial stage still trial moving nicely trial moving extremely nicely q q every quarter last year one thing talked earnings call year build grid test drive allows log website try grid one challenge people department evaluating virtual desktop infrastructure evaluate pretty much build one actually lot work expensive show actually give good user experience support application think supported virtual desktop infrastructure go see eye really encourage take next stage actually start thinking pilot project big first hump get people first eight week operation 10,000 people tried seems really interesting demand chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnellyes great looking think thing opinion shareholder return program well received investor base little halfway last second tranche 1 billion think look domestic cash position little bit le 50 net cash kind talk comfort level maybe going forward get second tranche company thinking continuing investor return shareholder return keep pace guess think want commit anything next year last year gave back 1 billion 1 billion actually year said intend give back 1 billion math dividend come 190 million already done 500 million executed 500 million asr finished june leaf 310 million presumably repurchase presumably rest year generate cash offshore actually given split recently probably math let see said publicly said publicly 80/20 offshore/onshore convert gave u 1.5 billion u cash issued actually net bit le 1.5 billion going forward lot option still strong generator cash clearly rather pay 35 bring back country always hope change strong cash position mean plenty option going forward okay fair say management still committed shareholder return saying yes want make promise next year certainly would speak last 2 billion two year quite lot return right yes well received okay great look guess near term lot thing kind around company whether commentary competition foundry thing supply chain guy great quarter knocked park guidance chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evendeni guess including get thing wrong missing maybe putting nvidia separate thing pointing concerned going kind term environment interesting question quite honestly every time someone side fence raise doubt channel go back team business manager say tell channel probe quite closely want make sure fully understand issue honestly seeing issue channel q2 unfolded much expected geforce perspective divide geforce business gaming sort side business oem business sell hp dell lenovo pretty much entirely business trajectory expected gaming business quite sharply q2 strong q4 western holiday basically strong q1 eastern holiday chinese new year fell strongly q2 always oem conversely actually strong q2 build back school july right nothing happens may june july back school nonlinearity quarter see ar spike well point raised one report see ar spike q2 well saw ar spike last q2 least linear quarter significant margin 60 sale typical much high past dynamic maybe seeing fall gaming q2 fall already factored right understood talk inventory inventory problem channel competitor may inventory problem better question could inventory affect u exist intuitively expect right point reduce price shift mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evendennow trouble screw channel mess future sale diﬃcult go back channel sell something full price going try wait two week see happens right got careful ca reduce price excess inventory since april right cryptocurrency mining fell cliff right two reason right one cost coin went two asics came market could mine literally switched around right certainly affect q2 well participate market anyway right saying amd excess inventory apparent effect u seem affecting u way year year dynamic interesting look q2 compared last q2 way record second quarter best second quarter ever look dynamic pc gaming pc oem think indicative true trend two segment pc gaming estimate growing 10 year market oem weak think probably going weakness driven couple thing principally fact consumer notebook market whole weak right exposure consumer mainstream oem graphic market generate although generates lot unit see market share number see attach rate number generate much revenue generates even le profit asp low gm low well think hear like intel talking consumer emerging market still diﬃcult careful mostly oem mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell imagine talking yes think anyone would look pc market say hi market want part guy putting pretty good result exactly point pc gaming market actually really good market really healthy 67 million people play league legend every month right regularly peak 7.5 million concurrent user amount prize money dota 2 tournament defense ancient tournament seattle last month greater price purse british open right 10 million prize money five team game five people team team member took home 1 million others got le 45 million people post clip twitch every month healthy got great game coming fall assassin creed latest assassin creed latest battlefield latest call duty bunch really good game coming ultimately game drive revenue think another surprise positive right last quarter tesla quadro tesla guess used kind lumpier business kind starting see know talked steadier oem adoption getting bigger lump getting bigger lump yes inaudible problem chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnellbut carry forward back half year new level tough know diﬃcult talk tesla customer bit cagy want u say tesla think tesla breakout year like last year really started zooming grew 37 year year largely strength distribution channel effectively anyone anyone supercomputer selling tesla solution whether ibm cray supermicro nec guy big strategic agreement ibm actually looking port enterprise application hadoop analytics big data analytics tesla hugely promising also big thing ibm going put nvlink power v8 build really supercomputer fast data connection cpu gpu lot business breakout last year distribution code porting year interesting thing driving accelerating growth like consumer internet company consumer service provider looking particularly image recognition speech recognition turn interesting thing brain easily computer find diﬃcult good speech recognition good image recognition computationally incredibly intensive using sophisticated algorithm running deep neural network run tesla better serve aligned interest inaudible amount computer power give better advertising start come fruition last quarter couple big order last quarter yes okay great question audience unidentified participant chris evenden unidentified participant chris evendenso rich ceo shazam keynote earlier panel brought basically using gpus inside datacenter unique kind specific kind internet use case scenario seeing broader interest tesla traditional internet cloud space well speech recognition akin like pattern recognition massive datasets suppose perhaps broader way putting shazam one great example customer actually allowed talk netﬂix published research using nvidia well given much detail beyond generally talking ad look example let want give clear example without implying anyone customer customer imagine post social networking site post picture new dog right social networking company able recognize dog photograph would start selling information dog food advertiser would buy ad page right targeting inaudible maybe could recognize picture baby advertise diaper diﬃcult task recognizing baby diﬃcult enough recognize face lot value able tag photo appropriately example one another example voice recognition driving user interface voice another one requires surprising amount compute power particularly training stage learn training algorithm recognize word correctly shazam great example like talk plenty others well tesla hpc inaudible versus kind kind type given breakdown trouble like even gave q2 might useful answer big win consumer internet q2 might distort gave mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evendenyou year consumer internet new would understate ca give useful answer estimate tesla 50 million quarter nice jump last quarter yes tesla whole separate whole right ballpark breaking consumer internet versus hpc word yes good good let talk mobile little bit right analyst day lot talk company tegra talking tegra automotive lot tablet lot smartphones people started reading kind talk commitment tablet smartphones longer term thinking sure well still interesting market u acknowledged withdrawn mainstream smartphone market mainstream smartphone market frankly commoditized faster thought would thought place differentiated product within marketplace really market competes price schedule pricing availability market ever want compete still interested phone me3 good example something driving revenue u tablet well mepad suppose coincidence yowme ph youme aggressive company focused growth focused differentiation finding place market help whereas using arm core everybody else graphic core everybody mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evendenelse really hard build new chip new device actually different anybody else still focused working really really hard build gaming ecosystem android believe 1.1 billion unit market year going segmentation like seen pc right pc market broadly speaking look like good market gaming pc great market think make argument mobile well broadly speaking big challenge market gaming niche defensible profitable something really add value component supplier right platform provider adding value far value silicon actually get sold motherboard spending tegra 400 million yes number gave split automotive inaudible also give u nice solid base growing steadily give u opportunity keep working building gaming ecosystem going hard right happen overnight built tegra k1 got great chip capable supporting latest graphical apis right ported bunch major game engine across suppose one people familiar unreal engine 4 one google used io demo new android amazing incredibly demo ported source across see life 2 portal shield ported unity engine 3 id tech 5 several engine ca name top head mike mcconnell chris evendenand thinking behind make much le expensive game developer port game across android tegra proposition perspective spend 60 million developing title ps4 xbox incremental cost bringing android could quite low certainly low context original 60 million actually know number relatively low already running running unreal engine 4 ps4 need run unreal engine 4 android tweaking need level tweaking rather porting right rewrite strategy issue gaming android trying prime pump mix metaphor get going okay okay question audience think time one two okay got ask question intel licensing supposed think probability ph confidence love able give like progress bar say 68 complete right going happen right either 0 100 intel licensing let take step back lot misinformation around licensing intel agreement sue like recipe book full clever idea use build graphic work way get see patent published three year filed engineer spoken say happen sitting bench thinking problem memory interface go see nvidia agreement sue recognition fact thousand engineer working clever processor technology thousand engineer working clever processor technology going overlap invent thing point want sue reason net ﬂow cash smaller company larger company revenue risk patent litigation right cross license actually pay well pay 6 million every 66 million pay u deal mike mcconnellnow cover patent patent patent perpetuity march 31st 2017 april 1st 2017 got patent sue however still got 6,000 engineer working technology area intel would assume eventually going end situation question well intel want wait take court think right three year time published bunch new patent think strong think well hang negotiation position never going strong today april 1st 2017 maybe renegotiate hope much better deal nvidia get continuity revenue get lower payment everyone happy take context fact working closely company sign licensing deal think see success next 2.5 year meanwhile got profitable growth business tesla grid well think also offset well lot reason think sky falling lot reason positive whole would say saw last report q2 actually company firing cylinder particularly gpu business automotive well debate mobile tegra think explained strategy interested got like two minute left think use 30 second say pc gaming really strong people want compare u someone compare u amd technically compete head head market look actually drive financial result different thing someone asked earlier today business behaving way amd like driven completely different dynamic right amd business dominated mainstream consumer pc console extent business dominated gaming pc workstation supercomputing couple thing well completely different business driver ca extrapolate one frustrating see people trying draw parallel none exist small part business bit oem graphic area overlap drive little revenue even le profit operatorthanks clarification helpful thank much chris really appreciate time question answer question
