number risk uncertainty including disclosed recent form filed sec statement represent view today relied upon thereafter disclaim obligation update today please welcome ceo ceo elon musk hi everyone hello hi thanks coming yes think got lot interesting news think going think well received hell year lot good thing happening think worth going thing model 3 last 4 quarter actually selling outselling competitor combined u.s .. highest revenue car u.s. performance actually car revenue including volume car like toyota camry honda accord dollar sale yes think people aware fourth number highest selling revenue past year car u.s remarkable electric vehicle highest revenue car country think 10 year ago nobody would believed thanks hard work tesla team result great said class model 3 outselling mercedes bmw 3 series audi a4 s4 lexus combined unit difference higher dollar also energy eﬃcient car world epa mile per kilowatt hour see model 3 around 4 range right want pick room improvement foreign language speak french quite funny new model range go actually motor trend drove nonstop bay area l.a admittedly downhill sort really feel downhill single charge go bay area l.a. pretty wild car especially sedan new model x range 325 mile despite large suv worth noting car exceeded electric car exceeded range first model came 2012 yes resisting temptation pick competitor still testament tesla engineering team able made car seven year ago still exceeded range car 370 mile steady improvement likely occur next year wo long range car yes get question lot want clear demand problem okay absolutely none sale far exceeded production production pretty good actually well decent shot record quarter every level going close got shot record quarter 90 order coming nonreservation holder new customer model 3 market potential see 63 nonpremium car mean people trading buy model 3 yes 12 midsized sedan 25 premium vehicle interesting supermajority essentially car traded nonpremium lot potential people look people look total cost ownership actual total cost ownership electricity much cheaper gasoline maintenance cost much le need oil change filter change basically never need change brake pad regenerative braking actual operating cost electric car much le gasoline car take educate people easiest thing look lease price purchase price factoring fuel maintenance actually buying model 3 like buying camry accord better yes better cost standpoint yes great car car designed fun keep putting gem like fart app course one favorite like perhaps finest work autonomy investor day think well received tesla full computer literally 20x faster 21x faster nvidia system replaces expect feature complete autonomy end year still need supervise autonomy able go garage parking space work without intervention obviously put billion mile testing think probably sometime next year able car autonomous without supervision sometime thereafter able convince regulator autonomy safe enough car could actually go around one really critical element billion mile testing ultimately ten billion mile huge ﬂeet powerful ai inference engine tesla full computer sensor car necessary car drive like would camera direction radar ultrasonics good imu gps kind thing think laid groundwork ﬂeet essentially every car made since october capable full autonomy view replacement computer alone need switch computer think lot people puzzled could say 1 million robotaxis end next year sum vehicle made since october essentially switch computer one made full driving computer month ago 1 million car capable still need regulatory approval capability massively increase value car fact think basically financially insane buy anything except electric car upgradable autonomy nut see one country another putting date banning gasoline diesel car environmental pressure move away fossil fuel getting stronger stronger basically mad buy fossil fuel car point resale value le le also important buy car upgradable least full car also worth much made comment like essentially buy gasoline car full like riding horse using ﬂip phone like hello wise really take u bit time educate consumer think people starting get like car major investment people often valuable asset going make choice valuable asset want look towards future say headed clearly headed jeffrey b. straubel elon r. musk jeffrey b. straubeltowards electrification clearly headed towards autonomy kind car want get think people starting realize model biggest segment vehicle world midsized suv 2.5x bigger model 3 market think probably demand model greater 3 x combined put lot effort eﬃciency car getting incredibly lower drag coeﬃcient think might able get drag coeﬃcient actually lower 3 quite unusual car lot room inside think like good sense design good design principle car look bigger feel bigger inside look outside good design car actually quite big inside expect hit volume production towards end next year internally aiming sooner want margin timing yes still find crazy gigafactory used rock rock bush remember j.b. drew hi guy actually guy want come join second yes yes yes think good maybe talk gigafactory remember like calculation battery capacity like need battery earth currently producing unless build thing going happen yes mean maybe tell story ... sure well good see everyone hello yes pretty crazy story elon talking recently sort amazing really simple kind napkin math could lead kind outrageous result mean said basically quick math looked okay going build 100,000 car per year many kilowatt hour per car therefore therefore 35 gigawatt hour cell per year well huge number actually entire world producing application cell phone computer car everything year kind shocked u said wow going work unless build entire new facility solve yes probably get battery factory world therefore better build yes mean crazy thing basically think 5 slide showed picture factory hill said investor need money build thing gave u money cool built elon r. musk jeffrey b. straubel elon r. musk yes yes built right really giant getting bigger 35 gigawatt hour capacity potential giga right sort 70 80 capacity realized think bit confusion earlier year panasonic said 35 technically yes 35 max capacity yet probably know end year next early next ... also lowest cost per kilowatt hour half global ev battery production add ev electric vehicle world battery use approximately equal make gigafactory maybe quick shout whole team team made happen mean epic project mean said starting dirt literally dirt desert biggest battery factory world took thousand thousand people kevin huge part sitting yes pretty amazing watching happen feel super proud part team yes making good progress gigafactory shanghai watched progress online get followed excruciating detail think number drone ﬂying factory pretty nutty need air traﬃc control shell building basically done point think might fastest large factory construction ever seen maybe something faster aware amazing already installing lot factory equipment stamping machine begin installing paint shop factory module line kind thing obviously extremely important future china largest electric car market world date pay import duty quite significant one ranging 15 40 access local incentive make car china local incentive going away think approximately factory start think coincidence least cost import duty cost le make car china able affordable car china market extremely important tesla future gigafactory europe see made great progress put picture like literally 5 minute ago deep planning actual place generic picture europe jeffrey b. straubel elon r. musk drew baglino elon r. musk drew baglino elon r. musk people going try reverse engineer exactly picture sure figured beautiful scene yes lovely put factory think may near hamburg something still looking right place put gigafactory europe hopefully make decision towards end year also make sense car factory least continent wise move continue expand think activity u.s .. pay tariff really long delivery chain high transport cost make car lot affordable people europe china yes looking forward making decision hopefully towards end year tesla energy looking probably least doubling energy storage growth powerwall powerpack compared 2018 internally bigger goal think least double least sort order 2 maybe approaching 3 gigawatt hour installing solar roof 8 state complete version 3 solar roof actually quite hard technology problem integrated solar panel solar cell roof tile look good last 30 year like roof last long time amount testing one accelerated life testing say predict perform spend six month testing project 30 year quite hard problem making easy install getting cost low really excited version 3 solar roof really confident think shot equal comp shingle roof plus someone utility cost maybe lower like one cheapest roof available potentially great roof better economics normal fairly cheap roof utility bill drew baglino elon r. musk drew baglino elon r. musk drew baglino jeffrey b. straubel elon r. musk jeffrey b. straubel drew baglinoso like basically better product lower price obviously take like crazy hard problem solve like many company tried solve problem executed think feel pretty good guy want say anything would say team super motivated goal think achieve mean laser focused achieving yes actually drew number meeting drew bang table damn got achieve done done intention intelligence invention make happen maybe actually introduce drew properly sorry kind forgot drew 14th year tesla drew exactly stranger drew joined team tiny tiny team like 5 10 u something couple year company got started trying know person involved almost every key initiative done company whole tenure think super amazing agree think guy see drew involved lot stuff still leading lot key initiative u anyway introduction drew jeffrey b. straubel elon r. musk drew baglino elon r. musk unidentified participant elon r. muskthank j.b yes super glad talk lot core technology area focused year yes thanks introducing j.b. welcome yes yes mean drew team really key lot powertrain innovation factory innovation solar roof number thing quite pleasure engineering discussion mutually feeling mutual right cool love bro got version 3 supercharger actually like scope technology advancing tesla really massive many front mentioned got version 3 solar roof coming soon got version 3 supercharger deployed around world 75 mile 5 minute capability system sure lot used supercharger typically anywhere 75 kilowatt used one recently might gotten 140 kilowatt version 2 version 3 250 kilowatt 250 kilowatt charging really eﬃcient car mile per minute super good fact think recently test sure tested like car could charge number mile half hour model 3 yes ... publishing new map supercharger deployment finally going get highway example ... alaska going go alaska yes actually map even include location really like 2 critical factor found sale given region really obvious actually service center within reasonable distance supercharger route like take want like 80 route like geez 1 trip ca really want supercharger service center absolute key sale really map sale like basically people like sensible like `` okay need service car need able travel conveniently route got sale good also good consumer financing make sure pricing competitive soon people see buy car pretty straightforward yes expanding supercharger network quite substantially time also enabling tesla use charging network like adapter key like buy car buying freedom freedom travel must supercharger must charging car break must fixed quickly actually really excited mobile service mobile service van come fix car soon break actually immediately send note tesla mobile service way fix car actually trialed bay area extended l.a. area number others tire repair come van arrive give new tire half hour way like make huge difference adding thing like bumper repair minor like collision repair look thing trouble customer thing like collision repair taking eternity body shop charging arm leg taking eternity moving lot body repair tesla even providing mobile service first bumper replacement mobile service van like typically collision repair take week month case took le hour yes ... right cyberpunk truck yes obviously got think product road map tesla incredibly exciting obviously model coming fairly soon year pickup truck hope unveil hopefully summer spent lot time designing pickup truck think going great think coolest car seen frank think everyone may share opinion worst case scenario build normal looking truck problem know look like something driving road look like came movie really cool think semi really look forward getting production hopefully towards end next year lot also dependent ability manufacture lot cell make lot battery pack much point adding product complexity enough battery complexity without gain elon r. musk jeffrey b. straubel elon r. musk drew baglino elon r. muskmatching product rollout according scaling battery production really main limiting factor scale battery production high level actually look supply chain might get mining business know maybe little bit least whatever ensure scale fastest rate possible point going battery powertrain investor day hopefully summer end year sure think big deal mean think outside investor would really focus 2 thing time line full plan scale battery production get cost per kilowatt hour lower basically battery cell full 2 strategic thing importance question answer haha exactly question asked online uploaded actually really smart question really impressed think say.com sayanything yes key question going scale battery production match vehicle demand guy want say anything let cat bag much still bag mean think right mean exactly right problem need solve scale time obvious think ever need solution cell production yes get cost per kilowatt hour lower intensity higher yes sitting yes sitting idly taking move required master destiny technologically otherwise think experience developed partner otherwise solution place drew baglino elon r. musk drew baglino elon r. muskyes good question aspect battery production integration maxwell think really quite strategic leave detail kind battery powertrain investor day important technology think big effect cost scaling cell production reducing cost reducing capital required scale cell production want add right absolutely sometimes little optimistic time frame time knew time knew yes optimism would optimistic geez actually advanced summon early access right making steady improvement close amazing quite close lot complexity parking lot turn would easy like open ground summoned car drive problem got navigate parking lot effectively going maze lot obstacle people moving car moving quite tricky close magical feel good going wide release relatively fairly soon yes mean want good mean simplest answer got awesome got awesome super safe ca want like run anyone would bad tricky like make car really sensitive grows paranoid move want make aggressive bad really threshold convenient summon car walk car convenient walk car summon useful move reasonably fast certainly faster could walk status tesla insurance pretty close able release small acquisition need complete bit software write wo long release yes pickup truck event sometime probably sometime towards end summer would guess like trying create something really new derivative vehicle road trying create something new basically copy form factor everything else still want great hard hard thing goal something functional great truck car vehicle u.s also better sport car basic 911 hard one like physically possible think yes think tesla could rely spacex starlink think would different antenna starlink starlink antenna think actually probably advanced phased array antenna world including military size medium pizza would fine truck rv airplane kind like house business something like would look little odd roof sedan think could make smaller antenna maybe use think likely would continue rely cellular network value starlink main value starlink providing access sparse moderately sparse like look relatively area like basically rural semirural area place connectivity right think like quite great system probably able serve like 3 5 people world lot people people world actually ideal density city really serve underserved poorly served starlink going tiny wiper think actually probably applying hydrophobic coating likely solve problem issue front radar accumulate ice snow front radar obscured apply thin hydrophobic coating sort coating usually solves problem probably something like word please clean snow camera feel good demand think major issue profitability always challenging fast growing company think scale tesla growing like hard appreciate last year doubled ﬂeet like made many car last year entire history year going pretty similar least sort 60 80 growth total vehicle ﬂeet maybe hard profitable level growth slow would good sustainability cost electric vehicle solar storage think cash ﬂow positive despite high growth rate ... update like rideshare guess like sort could kind practice rideshare ﬂeet people good figuring thing robotaxi ﬂeet future mean might make sense mean probably something like probably make sense yes sort supervised robotaxi yes happy take question audience q unidentified participant elon r. musk drew baglino elon r. muskwow okay yes know side starting know right side sure name brian campbell shareholder tesla couple year try buy share often afford really believe company product mission leadership want feel privileged able cast lot want thank whole tesla team hard work dedication question pertains tesla energy read several analysis concluding significant hurdle along path towards sustainable energy transmission electricity long distance since renewable energy production capacity concentrated certain region able eﬃciently transmit electricity region seems important part equation hoping might share thought part equation might make sense tesla someday get involved electricity transmission yes think big part value solar roof retrofit solar roof house business whatnot localized power generation battery storage also helpful stabilizing grid sort overproduce energy day release night actually use powerwalls powerpacks massive network grid stabilization providing energy essentially ﬂowing back grid would make big difference reducing need power line think people want power line generally great look great sort slightly unnerving drive kind thing want localized power generation need build substation power line think answer also storage really great way improve utilization existing transmission grid transmission grid kind like highway system rarely busy storage make busy time get lot utilization existing infrastructure yes fact like one thing think could pretty interesting utility done lot utility battery installation notably one south australia significantly outperformed expectation going number project australia around world done big project california think energy storage drew pointing actually extremely important could actually probably locally put powerpacks substation know substation sort like high power line come get dropped like say 11,000 volt 400 volt 500 volt get distributed community drew baglino elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. muskyou see bunch weird looking electrical equipment bunch high power line coming called substation could footprint fit number powerpacks drew point power usage low like night drop considerably charge powerpacks discharge day would need build extra substation power line disruptive community exactly southern california edison project substation exactly good existence proof yes tony miller shareholder china place lot car action right lot volume lot growth market 60 ev want ask giga 3 project goal building building operation maybe little bit bigger last year said 500,000 unit per year target seems little bit low ... okay sure think probably ... company country like china would give u like 29 player provider product seller stayed still wo also volume going higher volume learn get cost good thing also connect supply chain powerful advanced car electronics battery panasonic catl samsung lg people like demand side import fee car compare well product chinese like tesla style luxury quality range plus need help getting rid smog city maybe could even export factory asian factory target set 500,000 think china aggressive enough hold seen fast china factory built yes two month le q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participanti never seen anything built fast life pretty epic nothing ever built fast actually really ... 2 yes okay okay ca spend money fast run like yes mean think like long term factory probably 500,000 sort like interim goal maybe 1 million long term probably look maybe like china pretty big geographically may make sense factory part china order reduce logistics cost like big impact capital eﬃciency company time receive raw material building product getting product end customer compress time ideally ideal circumstance receive payment car pay ingredient car faster grow capital important localize product production supply chain close everything move really fast actually scale faster scale cash whereas counterpoint pay ingredient long get paid car currently true car outside u.s. put boat go custom transport within europe china s. production challenging cash ﬂow standpoint pay everything long get paid car big advantage local production china europe solving cash ﬂow gap daniel andy public real estate investment industry given continued need supercharger expansion think opportunity partner public real estate publicly traded real estate company buy land tesla want supercharger even buy land tesla currently owns supercharger structure lease initially cover cost holding land experience public real estate think would huge demand invest necessary infrastructure ev charging effectively tesla would finance aggressively speed supercharger expansion preserving tesla capital would interest well supercharger location actually either free leased low rate actually sometimes pay u elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. muskfrom think though provide capital equipment correct even get free yes sure lease even cell tower reit lease land lease equipment even equipment could financed think publicly traded real estate company okay think essentially like adding supercharger line little tricky dealing finance company generally say resale value scenario like sort tricky say sell think tends objection generally think capital eﬃciency supercharger quite quite good getting better ... work industry question love talk right right thank name dennis mcavoy happy model 3 model owner since 2012 believe representative vast majority tesla owner super happy company product think next car going get going another tesla read mainstream medium source information tesla think shoddy quality car spontaneously combust think ... yes ... company verge bankruptcy know true ... true q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk drew baglinoit true think hurting tesla intelligent friend holding purchasing tesla car concern future company company done fantastic job solving big issue confronted manufacturing engineering question plan put energy behind marketing communication take issue head true great american success story get told yes true true say distressing make sad sure yes know provide rebuttal typically varied like 7 paragraph thing incredibly crazy least 10x likely gasoline car combustion engine car name mean come highly ﬂammable ﬂuid designed burn 200,000 gasoline car fire per year u.s. alone extremely rare tesla car catch fire incredibly rare due extenuating circumstance slow almost never harmful mean would rather like cell phone cell phone mean like brainer think put kind energy towards solving problem put towards solving battery module production problem could could change narrative well really trying best somewhat loss like respond anything probably documentary make documentary yes crazy disinformation campaign ever seen yes yes yes ... elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participanti add appreciate optimism passion company think probably best asset bring table share everybody know give personal experience whatever way really best defense please continue seems like yes think safety especially think paramount u like absolute primary thing maximize safety car like bear statistic really hard serious injury tesla like quite rare look objective number like nhtsa probability injury could get internet tesla lowest probability injury car tested like possible 6 star would 6 star like literally absurdly safe yes lot force kind arrayed tesla lot force ... create content help spread okay sound good give information sort spread around mean reason sale good really guy sort customer testimony referral key sale good yes elon name steve shareholder since 2012 owned vehicle since 2013 enjoyed ride bit roller coaster true actually enjoyed coming 2012 okay yes yes last gentleman comment obviously mind many people mind going sneak little suggestion right constructive response challenging maybe one little opening would people michael bloomberg obviously titan medium industry also publicly express care environment elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk jeffrey b. straubel elon r. muskperhaps debate discussion joint discussion talk climate change public awareness think get point trying go something public might people know last year arianna huﬃngton expressed concern think would best served people think really biggest issue medium say issue biggest challenge seem anybody medium pointing party medium effectively utterly false narrative receive police escort public nobody speaking suggest people like bloomberg arianna huﬃngton sure good idea yes mean weirdly quite negative article bloomberg yes perhaps talking michael bloomberg would helpful agree need take action think definitely provide people like clear rebuttal disinformation good idea done piecemeal really like page debunks myth kind put together number comment made time could put together 1 page sort debunk myth going pretty good elon john irvine seeing model 3 successful solar facet business coming wondering see tesla mission accelerate avenue old transport hindrance facilitator see future mission well think really helped convince auto industry move towards electrification first started sort like kind mean clear always felt like electric car solar important freshman college always thought would happen obviously right thing physic standpoint guaranteed actually kind trace tesla back 2003 j.b. lunch el segundo rosen harold rosen harold yes jeffrey b. straubel elon r. musk jeffrey b. straubel elon r. musk drew baglino elon r. muskyes like good conversation well mean think made pretty amazing progress since exactly envision would unfold exactly standing least thought sure would fail like ... needed done mean clearly something worth even odds becoming today even 10 1 slim still worth pretty awesome see ev driving around every road place incredible still 1 rewarding awesome see come still long way go ca know feel mixed emotion pat back much definitely back 2003 2004 people thought like electric car stupidest thing ever definitely going work would bad every way like milk ﬂoat something like golf cart like would look good go far go fast like would bad every way kind like generally number time sort talk medium situation today negative pretty much always negative actually unchanged 2003 mean way back go way back like 15 year like oh tesla dumbest thing ever never going succeed like well think good chance wo succeed worth trying think almost every car company announced electric car announced car go electric sometime next decade good thing energy side complete picture guess brieﬂy say 100 renewable grid similar situation would say 2003 tesla number partner effort succeeding taking entire island part nation 100 renewable show growth key aspect mission yes personally rewarding j.b. well 2003 ta class talking q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participantyes go back yes exactly solar battery storage yes also like laughed pretty much still kind obviously key sustainable future think primarily solar obviously wind geothermal thing sustainable long term battery storage generally sustainable energy like sun shine 24 hour day battery like 3 element sustainable energy future electric car solar battery storage trying advance quickly possible think show done company try well great everyone name jessica heiss right work medium relation love help change negative narrative first elon wanted congratulate stephen hawking medal science communication question horse owner wondering towing capacity truck sure mean insult horse earlier way fine horse cool designed meet exceed tow tesla pickup truck able elon 90 minute want take one question side yes yes question fine elon name caleb elston recently got model 3 happy hardware 3 watched investor day autonomy talked lot fsd chip neural network talk much gap navigate autopilot today end 2019 wondering could geek little bit going go till december january february feature wise already running car like demo going cherry pick give confidence feature complete feature complete possible excite u little bit going like elon r. musk drew baglino elon r. musk q unidentified participant yes mean drive like latest development version software take house oﬃce intervention time perfectly deal every intersection every turn think possible like well obviously like game system make perfect particular route going work route route change construction wo work hard come general solution one read car company issue specific solution brittle rely map lot lidar high precision like really expensive gps inertial measurement even general solution go route used work release something releasing 500,000 car world general solution progress may appear slower actually relative others developing technology fact think quite lot advanced element release general solution also like plateau reach taking alternative approach experienced team lot work ahead investor day like trajectory crazy especially advanced compute capability personal comment guess yes learn lot term like retrain neural net discover okay need train need net going like really effectively recognize curve example previously trained net free space like free space anything drive going destroy car comfortable driving like dirt car drive grass like technically yes going disturbing like road edge curb 2 training net developing right say independent drivable free space want know drivable free space emergency need go shoulder road avoid something okay drive free space important also need know true road space end undesirable go past true road space especially parking lot tight corner recognizing curve like little detail make important yes mean working like development version car actually 2 dev branch 1 enhanced summon 1 full driving 2 different car would good release general public think yet right elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q

much u future generation want thank team great work cheer oh thanks cool thank much appreciated elon tesla come india elon r. musk q jennifer behr elon r. musk q jennifer behr elon r. musk q jennifer behr elon r. musk thought question might asked hope soon regulatory like rule importing india kind complicated yes definitely want come india like complicated rule around like tariff importing allowed sale service currently able sell many car make adding additional complexity required right think really want come india soon think would really surprised next year think least next year think yes right right name jennifer behr behalf peta people ethical treatment animal okay steering wheel yes steering wheel got last year annual shareholder meeting assured u model `` would leather including steering wheel steering wheel tried confirming privately met silence website specify also understanding current tesla model come standard leather steering wheel need special ordered vegan true currently know united nation report animal agriculture includes leather industry responsible greenhouse gas emission world transportation combined higg index found term water scarcity climate change ... yes okay got totally agree actually asked question team earlier week believe close nonheated steering wheel leather challenge heat nonleather material also well wear time steering wheel like actually really need hardy lot like lot basically oil sweat stuff hand get kind nasty like right surface treatment material easier proposition solve seat steering wheel actually remarkable amount effort solve steering wheel thing working hope release soon q jennifer behr elon r. musk q jennifer behr elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant fantastic confirm model vegan promised yes tesla model free animal product next year shareholder meeting might tiniest bit left sure model model 3 think confident lot thing solve think sure model model 3 soon also special order x yes like third row dan howe quick question expressed frustration think frustrated medium narrative around tesla expressed frustration refuting false information another alternative proactively advertise question thought revisiting advertising decision sure well saying currently selling car make spending money advertising would make thing worse financially sure probably increase demand selling car make thing necessary right trying make many car possible yes think like advertising like generally aversion advertising like much trickery advertising like lot false association whereas bad product put nice environment people like trick buying like common advertising quite strident tends sort bad like advertising reason could advertising term information refute issue tricky though ad say `` look car catch fire b people might think `` car actually catching fire like going much trickery advertising like maybe opposite thing happening would say advertising forever necessary thus far yes yes elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified participant elon r. musk q unidentified

last question one last question yes yes last question everyone lux filaday really exciting question tesla make aquatic car mean like quad bike something mean quad car aquatic car boat submarine car oh aquatic oh see okay mean car go water basically water funny mention actually design submarine car like one spy loved sort lotus turn sub actually thought like coolest thing seen movie actually one movie one actually transform like fin wheel obviously going work make bit bigger actually submarine car like technically possible think market small small enthusiastic actually design submarine car like would diﬃcult would bit distraction think maybe make one show car point would really fun thank thanks everyone right thanks
