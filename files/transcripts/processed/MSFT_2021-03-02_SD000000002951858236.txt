good evening good afternoon keith wei morgan stanley equity research department run software research group pleased u end day think one presentation day one tmt conference jason zander executive vice president azure microsoft definitely topic talk lot investor talking lot really happy jason u afternoon chat thing azure going business get started brief disclosure important morgan stanley research disclosure please website www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures one programming note bunch question going going operator instruction way jason thank much joining u control room look like going landing next mar rover behind right den actually went overboard wife oﬃce cloud collaboration center redmond right campus basically use place hackathons et cetera little bit quiet covid normally place packed hopefully excellent jason thank coming conference azure cloud definitely super high list topical debate investor azure keith wei jason zander keith wei jason zanderdefinitely core investment thesis microsoft great question answer maybe start could outline little bit role responsibility microsoft evp azure cover total yes evp azure remit kind like call system team microsoft ceo like call u mean everything silicon quantum computing operating system window linux provide rest company cloud software infrastructure paas data analytics iot operational side set vertical actually help specialize recently lot work around telco communication operator space well part core strategy job day job evp also member microsoft senior leadership team nutshell outstanding great purview maybe start big picture question sort overall kind public cloud space seen rapid pace innovation past 2 three year seen microsoft really see explosive growth category talk u bigger change seen overall marketplace past couple year sort crisis could talk sort type change pace change see coming crisis yes leading crisis course big trend people moving data center public cloud course continues talk pace moment maybe around course huge amount work u would say big area seeing return change lot focused around data analytics basically unlock data silo get understanding get insight say competitive one super important also seeing whole bunch adoption across area like iot effort started five year ago team trillion message day keith wei jason zanderhave unbelievably really great set customer lighthouse win et cetera lot work ai ml continues hot trend say one big area thinking vertical specialization working folk industry lot stuff talked horizontal could considered supporting think seeing u get involved vertical business value proposition well got got great hear solution really coming forefront becoming bigger part story analyst looking financial perspective like hear solution better gross margin kind shift focus sort happened past year calendar moving forward lot people talking think started satya came april conference call think 1 first really talk crisis accelerating pace digital transformation made comment seeing like two year digital transformation past 6 week talk seeing term customer interaction mean customer talking accelerating pace digital transformation yes satya totally right mean saw course everybody needed respond quickly got folk need work home got school home whatever look like found already cloud path able react quickly oftentimes day opposed might month plan place really proved point digital transformation hyperscale cloud saas service saw huge amount volume think seen since people often case looked opportunity move faster think one thing team able say gosh something 2 week originally planned go spend next year like okay maybe actually move faster maybe taking long see sentiment also think company looked also impact cost envelope extent cloud helping get better keith wei jason zanderoperational envelope essentially spending need everything could cloud take care actually helped acceleration migration workload adoption future piece question economy get stronger course hope expectation u everyone else space able see additional growth related got got want sneak one tactical question something think mike spencer head ir talked u heard conference call went crisis microsoft reached helped customer better use azure resource talk u kind rationalizing spend talk u exactly mean went helped customer make sure utilizing azure eﬃciently possible yes absolutely mean one thing would say even thing back 2008 end day helping customer successful often could challenging kind situation want somebody actually partnering customer mean usually looking way help weather storm well one turn core value proposition cloud actually tool built operational portal allow user come back give recommendation actually come back say could actually saving money bill maybe allocated super big virtual machine run workload workload really using maybe quarter quarter close actually downsizing saving money actually built thing product system think value honestly generally find help somebody save money budget modular recession kind related stuff usually happens got project backlog like get keith wei jason zander keith wei jason zanderthey may even strategic already help free budget unlocks next set project opposed even bringing kind point right guess side equation prove azure eﬃcient platform utilizable use case economical use case understand real eﬃciency platform correct generally find kind pattern right mean start getting operational environment place start figuring operate thing start training staff get first workload going start realizing wow faster eﬃcient point actually help save money start seeing steep rise kick think overall actually great optimization customer like said increase usage right way got hopefully exit crisis get back normalized environment think talked acceleration sort shift cloud acceleration digital transformation effort see fundamental change way people thinking cloud architecture microsoft always talked lot hybrid architecture going public cloud shift basis shift towards public cloud versus given went still think going relatively hybrid environment basis think going hybrid environment course one tenant design since beginning azure case cloud company put hybrid slide usually meant migration case meant going edge going public cloud want combination think actually cemented fact look even competitive perspective starting see even company compete start produce actually call real hybrid solution seem keith wei jason zander keith wei jason zander keith weissto backed disk right strategy course benefit u since day 1 got rich product portfolio support going forward would say another thing frankly went covid supply chain bunch stuff think lot company started realize much needed keep track dependency deploying thing even world may even want control whether data center hybrid scale country hybrid cloud country want regulation rule around area investing think oﬃce 365 15 year investing control support kind thing think way built product way run actually lends well trend show along line got talking kind definition sort define various kind cloud architecture one thing get thrown around lot think different definition different people idea multi cloud right hear lot smaller vendor talking customer want optionality want get locked one big cloud vendor always going type solution given conversation large kind public cloud user cio large enterprise talking mean architecture actually look like yes case chosen strategically figure inaudible jason sorry volume got low hear okay still low jason zander keith wei jason zander keith wei jason zander right better yes much better okay sorry even though fancy area still using laptop ab problem still mine sorry yes apologize discussing ... talking environment mean end customer environment yes sorry busy tech support yes environment perspective oftentimes happen people make decision around want one vendor working course going absolutely respect case may decide make certain project feel like got solution azure synapse azure purview really want data analytics absolutely maybe already started infrastructure work another cloud want support set thing think folk need keep mind one certain amount expense associated got security control got work mean going like isvs time isvs target one cloud actually invest expensive created technology like azure arc designed allow thing like security policy protocol work hybrid work big cloud provider work top vmware et cetera thing azure arc also data discovery tool azure purview azure sentinel security lot way see u produce set technology around security management deployment et cetera work everybody help least get top level still multi cloud absolutely continue support open source worried lock great use open source work everybody keith wei jason zanderand course still partner bunch isvs particular domain course run big cloud make sure experience sap fantastic example got want shift gear little bit talk available market tam azure couple year back dave tmt conference made executive would say known hyperbole made statement stage said like `` oﬃce 365 great limited amount knowledge worker globe great thing azure like target optimizing opex like virtually unlimited market opportunity sound excited exciting sound huge hard investor wrap head around opex give u hand understanding microsoft think market opportunity dimension think term trying size trying rightsize investment term market opportunity today growing basis yes dave cfo work directly yes right prone hyperbole absolutely right know dave know exactly talking right opportunity would actually come top level opportunity tam probably like 4 trillion address everything everything silicon hardware vertical et cetera mean massive massive massive market even bring back start thinking maybe 1 trillion still 1 trillion get estimate hey infrastructure service hundred billion dollar data et cetera couple different thing one go back address tam course going start call like horizontal support course infrastructure data analytics iot used domain would say big thing see combination kind like migration existing workload want run hybrid/hyperscale cloud course get lot folk leverage u keith wei jason zander keith wei jason zanderthen case people actually modernizing taking tier 1 workload something maybe running data center even different set isv software 20 year ago modernizing saying want cloud thing man guy got tier 1 support another opportunity u go spend perhaps different isvs past cloud vertical u get vertical see work done microsoft cloud health care cloud retail cloud manufacturing actually announced agriculture et cetera think see technology need meet need particular industry tam expensive solution give powerpoints excel everybody use kid soccer game 1 trillion sovereign wealth fund great work case get much vertical think opportunity u going got got massive term tam describing think investment profile particularly geographic footprint azure term region data center continues grow investor think pace growth basis term lot new geos need lot expansion footprint need done pretty good footprint right kind filling data center basis yes let also one comment say going vertical want make sure also clear partnering si isvs basically competing customer cloud actually think gosh go capture margin look like good opportunity case going continue partner think huge opportunity u go space help enable ecosystem want make sure clear cause confusion question ... whole another section vertical cloud going dig able come back one keith wei jason zanderall right able come back want make sure clarify statement upfront yes global expansion perspective goal try make sure serving essentially bulk world gdp look region got 60 getting pretty much great coverage worldwide perspective continue go go think kind increased thinking around sovereignty government privacy et cetera sort thing always going important think lends even better hybrid strategy build hyperscale data center region cost billion dollar go go create keep going providing worldwide coverage always going economically viable real hybrid strategy come handy still give cloud asset sort availability added another 7 data center alone q2 actually increased eﬃciency fast go build thing get ready land operate continue increase eﬃciency across set thing well actually super important going make technology available much pivoting towards technology really want make sure available world consumer world business got could sort take little bit detour talk differentiation drive underlying infrastructure term whether geographic footprint way set infrastructure one question got client whether could differentiate silicon whether guy working differentiate silicon talk potential differentiation core infrastructure layer yes sure mean core infra layer still significant amount r effort need go mean obviously done well respect eﬃciencies fast build fast time operate impact course margin et cetera also impact capacity customer make sure keep growing always rely u provide thing build software need run number hardware skus know kind location called window server sql server set product keith wei jason zanderbut going data center hardware everything certified significantly optimization north south stack everything silicon hardware hypervisor et cetera entire software hardware silicon stack optimize entire thing also pulled supply chain figure get run scale mean afford go level customization allows u support new workload keep bringing cog also continue go kind price performance requirement space something ca unless hyperscale cloud hyperscale cloud actually scale pull got got turning azure growth opportunity basis know microsoft give estimate give number sort run rate azure estimate 30 billion revenue run rate right think next several year would stack rank best growth opportunity excited term driving new dollar azure platform next say 2 three year yes actually quite pleased course q2 number cloud segment 16.7 billion q2 50 number mention azure course already growing business excited respect concrete question see segment look still whole bunch work front u industry respect making shift hyperscale data center whole bunch data center deal whole bunch folk migration work want talked pace kind accelerating based kind economic condition still going bread butter still whole bunch work really think data analytics probably one biggest one popping right speak need people able break data silo get faster loop tying system record operational system able pull insight drive business keith wei jason zanderand tech think awesome solution azure synapse azure purview cosmos db mean seeing pattern pop place actually really great pattern able actually optimize business huge area addressable revenue speak one got longer bet trying work within vertical industry figuring way help would actually continue grow going forward part think got really good play across got got maybe could dig one kind growth category little bit deeper think sort core shifting workload public cloud survey every quarter think twice year asked question percent workload running different environment think recent survey overall cloud 24 workload include software service infrastructure service platform service right around 10 11 overall workload one kind put think industry term overall rate penetration two kind key driver sort pushing people like industry stickier like able get compliance regulatory ready security concern yet done like incremental catalyst driving number higher perspective yes number roughly sound right say feel like still lot runway front u mean directionally saying around number yes kind make sense think big set project people go go big thing really changed last year matter like joined azure team 2012 kind like prime data center cold hand right different kind era think fact number lot runway front u make sense people really coming plan got move place thought stickier even couple year ago financial sector couple health care area like regulatory system defense area well oftentimes keith wei jason zander keith wei jason zander keith weissthere either specialization and/or high degree sophistication present think cloud matured significantly since run running socs workload microsoft cloud year think done start seeing example defense adoption show usually defense contractor defense space looking fintech fintech guy looking defense ... jason think lost audio right hold going take one hear okay yes yes okay good right risk looking right face going risk microphone worked 2 hour nonstop inaudible laptop pick anyway like said think seeing people waiting single lever security regulation kind maturity moving fintechs fan et cetera quite think look business retail lot quicker lot longer think past inaudible got got data analytics side deep dive report overall kind market term data management side equation cloud side equation think investor surprised see market share gain microsoft making side equation sql server database getting lot performant lot le expensive competitor like oracle think surprising part equation microsoft far leading share database talk kind got position think idc number something like 1.6 billion database sql server database cosmos synapse like guy jason zander keith weissseeing strength guy think competitive dynamic cloud versus yes big thing want first solution sql server absolutely core part situation data business offer post mysql open source database run regular system course license people run database top platform investing sql service server service et cetera last eight year pretty solid actually changed built product ship product addition kind relational side house look cosmos db operational kind database synapse pulled whole thing together started blur line category see huge amount adoption across kind seeing adoption super excited really idea taking system record operational database synapse link pulling together getting tight analytics loop without transforms stuff slow stuff differentiated technology also think another good reason feel like gotten really good adoption related respect question like hey talk little bit kind like hybrid et cetera environment look like try super ﬂexible like truth nobody move data cloud overnight combination got got cloud federate work workload big enterprise reality even want move cloud going take period time azure hybrid benefit bring license like 1/3 server user use hybrid benefit give ﬂexibility able move workload one place get right kind hybrid solution got dig real quickly azure hybrid benefit something amy called u lot part core driver kept premise serving tool part equation growing really nicely last couple jason zander keith wei jason zanderof year exactly hybrid cloud benefit important cio good growth driver guy hybrid benefit basically allows ﬂexibility use license got window server sql server decide keep decide actually put azure cloud fact actually move decision go based business requires like mentioned 1/3 window server sql server user actually leveraging hybrid benefit license kind mobility ﬂexibility truth 5x expensive run application cloud provider cost economics much cheaper run use azure ﬂexibility able decide want want cloud maybe going change solution based upon project ultimate ﬂexibility looking got want sneak one question investor think pertinent sort data analytics story could new technology like snowﬂake based data warehousing vendor commoditize hyperscalers compress margin snowﬂake partner space first foremost absolutely always make sure company like snowﬂake sap vmware whole bunch company partner may alternate solution maybe got solution space first foremost going make sure customer choice right inaudible running snowﬂake get azure marketplace running platform mean maybe data warehouse snowﬂake also put power bi whole bunch thing ecosystem cloud actually also good win going make sure run workload frankly really wanted work even selfishly people would pick different cloud could get outcome course want make sure alignment u partner going keep respect margin multiple different way think like end somebody picked snowﬂake choice going talk best run top badger keith wei jason zanderopportunities like said extended ecosystem around snowﬂake benefit complementary snowﬂake pick ﬂat yet course going pitch azure synapse tell think best possible choice let let make call end day think cloud big picture win getting folk cloud use high order bid get within course want differentiate product let take cloud business perspective strategic win u open sort revenue opportunity got another interesting investor question going try sneak kind talk pace workload adoption also brings sort developer equation question kubernetes whether rising adoption kubernetes container architecture could make easier could provide lubricant pushing workload public cloud environment developer sort new application development take place kubernetes absolutely great opportunity mean nothing else container environment make much simpler agile company able take workload start getting even dev test purpose point like want go land get container world allows leverage include looking public cloud good win agility perspective help migration side good news kubernetes actually azure team brendan burn actually google kubernetes came actually build azure kubernetes service azure written guy standard first place got awesome set technology built solution work hybrid perspective edge also cloud think development pattern use software development think make ton sense good step towards even completely another kind set technology one step past container see keith wei jason zandersome additional adoption come sort thing well yes modernization really good productivity win got got wanted turn gear cloud verticalization something mentioned earlier think last year guy announced first specific cloud offering health care last year usually talked microsoft cloud retail think guy nrf show believe announcement last week ahead build week manufacturing cloud missing couple talk u verticalized cloud one side equation point different amazon saying hey listen going store right deverticalization actually come solution yes microsoft talk vertical support cloud health care cloud manufacturing last week et cetera know designed complementary ecosystem work si work isvs going likely partner someone vertical like retailer logistics going take pick partner think bringing software platform edge capability bring table want partner folk different area cloud provide find rather saying look bet oﬃce 365 whatever want go cloud health care example actually see solution around patient telehealth thing like thing like leverage microsoft team microsoft oﬃce 365 dynamic see thing integrated solution rather go build thing scratch actually leverage tech also using multiple isvs one thing seen especially larger organization also need bridge may still particular area one partner really vertical solution got another department us different one bring thing together solution optimizing vertical cloud think approach work pretty well keith wei jason zander keith weissbecause longer kind chemistry set could anything kind hard making actually solution make faster adoption actually versus setting shop saying well look like good industry go look cooky mean definitely inaudible got give end customer isv system integrator head start building solution template fit industry template already kind aligned problem business process trying automated specific technology would align like like commerce technology retail cloud versus know maybe hipaa type technology health care cloud technology specific vertical yes absolutely let take couple good example think health care idea telehealth ability go mean especially since still covid protocol part world able come leverage something like microsoft team transcription subtitling rest work plus course communication ims like example health care super super interesting could also use universal comms industry case specific relevant think manufacturing case lead built azure iot fact already actually used big oems build let say industrial equipment thing like building elevator milling machine line mean already fact come help pull thing together looking accelerant even partner ecosystem every project turn kind thing example manufacturing universal coms telehealth et cetera good example several got got think maybe kind wrapping talked kind machine learning ai one core driver forward basis jason zanderfrom perspective think one thing learning lean past year couple year machine learning ai dependent data side equation right think software opportunity much anything able make use data whether iot data whether existing data taking place legacy system able pull able make sense data put together one side equation putting machine learning algorithm underlying kind compute together solve specific problem guy try bring together right broad set technology put sort weigh balance like customer want technology side equation need data integration data manipulation tool need overall solution saying listen inventory management inventory optimization whole solution present span spectrum exactly like type machine learning solution customer looking definitely capture challenge mean truth everyone partner maybe different layer stack think though logical thing starting foundation stub wall ﬂoors ceiling shingle kind think particular way course want make sure first foremost best possible infrastructure anyone want run ai could advanced company deep partnership openai advanced research anywhere massive huge huge compute huge number parameter model like unbelievably big case going partner make sure base foundation go stack find folk like look really want add kind image recognition thing like iot image recognition get trained camera conveyor belt looking part treated picking defect probably want start scratch want go build entire whole data center go want simple image recognition provide paas service provide simple api cost developer plug data actually simple training sudden get running keith weissexpenses hire 18 data analyst come work get value end course get top level integrated lot ai saas application case mean see oﬃce 365 productivity recommendation heck even developer tool kind telecode inside vision inter developer analyzes code running compare whole bunch code analyzed tell could written better cleaner safer code really freaking amazing driven whole bunch data think infrastructure layer got apis simple use want get started saas layer well think pretty much help layer r last thing mention one r effort around ai massive work openai one example one like using holographic processing unit hololens think sucker essentially photon coming eyeball captured camera augmented holographic image come eye brain ca tell difference like take one month train ai model go holographic processing unit put hololens like wow like want know microsoft invested like wow people like oftentimes people think incredibly advanced ai another example given infrastructure give tool library anytime hard stuff like try make available service offering inside azure others got got wanted u little bit security interesting conversation security microsoft go back 5 seven year ago right security friction getting people adopt public cloud adopt azure security perhaps something microsoft working get people confident using software overall recent conference call gone far way security 10 billion business microsoft underlying infrastructure secure enough guy run stuff firm like morgan stanley run within azure security expertise productized selling marketplace jason zandercan talk little bit azure security term gotten term security infrastructure also solution selling end market know sentinel term sim security solution built azure yes huge area point always work secure course service oﬃce 365 xbox name always go built system handle one thing done course window window socket et cetera done gone back take thing built actually pull customer inaudible use start end point window pc also like android iphone iot actually security iot device actually pull understand going make sure firmware date et cetera part security regimen come back cloud side look defender use apps defender well microsoft microsoft defenderfor oﬃce 365 piece go super important give look device historical mentioned sentinel actually differentiated piece technology seat basically need done entirely cloud already handling petabyte unbelievable number signal every day pull stuff together expectation able use combination defender end point protection got sentinel able track able use steam based technology thing come together quite well see business traction think value proposition business think going super valuable put much simplicity handling much space cobble together solution build default product oﬃce 365 azure security thing come together think actually pretty powerful combination still work vendor source data actually look hybrid environment like cloud based like mentioned already keith wei jason zander keith weissheterogeneous end point vendor kind device got got 10 minute left session bunch investor question want get couple category going try kind bunch lot question competitive environment particularly versus aws gcp maybe sort question pose guy think competition hyperscalers change move like infrastructure service level platform service level different type competitive dynamic yes say infrastructure level course compete fact done hybrid work really invested year software even solution got worldwide coverage infrastructure level course look paas perspective area really pushed hard long period time mentioned time think data analytics space purview synapse et cetera think differentiator super interesting u able compete also dynamic going partner compete still relevant lot case lot folk want make sure picking somebody technology provider helping actually going business complementary thing important thing help customer get premium service structure u make lot easier also beneficial business competitive environment good customer think big strategic bet like hybrid super important honestly lot especially enterprise customer probably working u vendor probably preferred vendor decade count trust also delivery trust partnership long time also go competitive evaluation got got helpful actually getting lot question silicon semiconductor one say entering time value/ip jason zandermigrating back semi layer hardware layer interesting thing azure enable compute side reasonable company could another question vision road map arm portion workload expect migrating custom silicon time lot question value migrating back silicon layer address yes cloud going often different kind client form factor let talk cloud core remit cloud perspective spending money buying equipment software stack well pretty much give ownership north south even partner particular level like component vendor chip cpu whatever still buying enough still optimize entire stack mean already long period time worked even silicon provider customizations make sense environment thing could proprietary actually go back fit core give concrete example confidential computing secure enclave technology think going critical bunch security work something worked intel five year nobody else already gone deeper amd version actually arm version technology example data center enterprise go back ask never enough volume probably able justify staff electrical engineer staff electrical engineer since go kind work think expect continue make sort investment silicon also hardware form factor around component integration et cetera mean nvram kind distributed memory another great example innovation industry showing cloud first primary thing get benefit fact get run ﬂeet way want run ﬂeet mean make sure fully optimized north south maybe stop make sense asked question type cpu first keith wei jason zanderon otherwise think answer question around arm versus x64 et cetera yes let go like arm ability sort customize load shift yes great yes look mean like couple different thing one fully expect going continue add capability gpus inaudible cpu component networking gear thing like place done whole bunch customer work well want fast time want control et cetera done lot customer work around see cpu perspective think truth significant portion existing software especially enterprise software still x64 long period time optimizing big database run big kind isv software et cetera bulk stuff running x64 today course great partnership intel great partnership amd primary silicon vendor cpu space kind work arm perspective server absolutely whole bunch work many different silicon vendor produced arm part designed big scale thing would put pocket thing put data center expect time continue see good distribution always keep mind x64 workload running bulk stuff today think lot workload future especially start looking kind solution well good candidate think see lot noise thing always keep mind cpu one component cost component one thing pay margin design around also ram disk whole bunch component networking et cetera go cloud dominated one thing think important industry hyper conﬂate price performance cpu thing part equation keith wei jason zander keith wei jason zanderthere bigger broader thing different trying go drive scale something new bringing market think careful conﬂate thing caused lot customer confusion got got think good segue last topic want cover last couple minute potential drive operating eﬃciencies plan microsoft seen tremendous increase overall cloud gross margin past several year break azure gross margin particular feel free wanted right michael never forgive next meeting inaudible awkward let inaudible decision inaudible amy said azure eﬃciencies garnering increasing eﬃciencies within azure plant big part moving overall cloud gross margin higher talk u little bit left like room eﬃciencies squeeze sort existing plant necessitate got higher value solution unless selling higher mix database going tap pretty soon yes think still opportunity still work set target planning perspective every six month semester boundary new target eﬃciency team continue go go even stuff talked even optimization several thing continue work supply chain optimizing supply chain make sure get part faster get running quicker customer make sure get macular utilization work thing invest basically making software eﬃcient hardware eﬃcient supply chain eﬃcient continue bottom line expect azure cloud going competitive market absolutely going competitive magic anything required investing continue keith wei jason zandernow said perspective become harder harder time yet become harder harder bunch fruit take lot hard work got keep think also important microsoft perspective continue invest ahead revenue go capture share adding 7 data center last quarter alone investing secret top secret cloud u.s. example investing capture share case highly specialized share frankly couple cloud world actually one mean example continue invest got know esg initiative particularly carbon initiative something top mind microsoft bill gate published book talking guy pretty aggressive target carbon neutral sort sticking back carbon guy ever admitted lifetime run counter sort driving eﬃciencies get way part parcel listen want green want cleaner lot eﬃcient well yes mutually exclusive stated goal 2030 company like lifetime microsoft back bill paul 12 people way company today going go negative technology announced cool thing europe called northern light carbon capture even use work seismic hpc work order able capture carbon actually get stored sort energy back point cost u well truth area world especially look nordic actually renewable energy energy system fact fjord hydro et cetera home state washington washington state actually system think green go esg goal help carbon work keith wei jason zander keith wei jason zanderi think one thing see microsoft trying take deliberate approach recognize need balance thing also need help world get need hope exemplar also hope partner folk generating energy system use today also innovating sustainable solution using tomorrow actually leverage way get back industry want able come back help company may big carbon footprint figure way iot technology carbon capture whatever tech figure actually reduce also part esg solution mean think right think actually balance one extreme going win going balance pretty practical stuff want pull excellent jason generous time fascinating conversation lot going within azure within broader microsoft right thank sharing view much appreciate time fascinating discussion thank much appreciate inviting hopefully next time person using microphone mine sound great thank jason awesome thank much
