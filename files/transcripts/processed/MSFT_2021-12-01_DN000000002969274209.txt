hey good morning thanks everyone joining u day two well fargo tmt summit michael turrin software analyst well excited next session privilege rolling coverage microsoft recently joining u today largest software company planet think neck neck largest company chance check lately charles lamanna cvp business apps platform microsoft start question list front anyone something like type shoot email michael.turrin wellsfargo.com best add conversation well charles thank joining u today certainly appreciate time yeah thanks michael super excited discussion think lot good topic microsoft share agree mean maybe framing conversation start obviously admire many end market company presence within day maybe could help add context around role responsibility key product area focus help steer conversation dive absolutely sound good head call business application platform team basically map dynamic 365 power platform set product lead product management well engineering component michael turrin charles lamannaso basically design implementation servicing different cloud offering area 4 year worked azure 4 year joined azure 2013 company founded acquired microsoft say slowly moved stack infrastructure paas saas inaudible platform directly sell software company head eventually mean great start azure question time started azure pretty darn good say congrats let start evolution business application microsoft mean dynamic around time dynamic became 365 recent period time growth trajectory dynamic 365 really stood particularly late talk around evolution dynamic maybe driving recent strength absolutely certainly mentioned dynamic around long time microsoft went bit say rapid evolution sorry 5 year ago really started idea dynamic 365 future business application microsoft first biggest piece really moving business cloud cloud first really make business delivered saas product easy sign easy trial easier compared say legacy premise heavy crm erp offering first important piece done quite time second big thing started reimagine business application mean kind future go build apps 2005 2010 biz apps 2020 2025 2030 thought really required u focus three main theme fundamentally change adopt use business application first thing data first idea every single company massive amount data coming everything whether commerce website mobile application iot name massive amount data different biz apps past data entered human filling form idea large amount data leveraging business application second thing data course want go make prediction use intelligence ai natural language understanding nlu get value data idea automation help thing like reducing cost delivering customer support 20 25 improving targeting upsell website 5 really top line bottom line moving outcome ai different pure ai platform tied business process third piece around collaboration idea past say biz app data biz app user kind lived little island throughout company big push want go reimagine world data shared across company people work together like want silo data silo line business start reimagine whether silo people either people come together work right data right place right time move cloud focus data ai collaboration course third piece critical built product portfolio easy adopt required u break monolithic crm erp offering gone day people remember dynamic crm dynamic inaudible dynamic ax two big apps everything one diï¬ƒcult implement premise cloud reimagine actually bunch individually adoptable application really span across five main area customer area number one around customer support help customer deliver customer support thing like dynamic 365 customer service power virtual agent ai builder well new channel digital voice capability item number two around supply chain core

effective like shared recently dynamic 365 revenue grew 48 45 constant currency 70 revenue cloud new area like power apps growing right around 200 growth lot new exciting rapidly growing product kind embracing idea cloud embracing idea data ai collaboration maybe little bit longer answer wanted think good left right view microsoft michael turrin charles lamanna set stage planning heard intelligent application power platform mantra quite bit good get know context behind well want go key pillar laid start data particular hearing lot around data right changing standard focused first party data voice customer microsoft customer insight position around cdp talk around customer data application side absolutely think like area really interesting right many customer thing like idfa change apple well move like cookie le future browser basically requiring everybody rethink replan track know customer engage digital service area good news basically every company degree digital transformation

degree independence going important go fundamental change track provided browser mobile device michael turrin charles lamanna michael turrin charles lamannado going effective see impact already know last couple quarter lot news impact idfa change particular come b2c company well company provide advertising great area mentioned automation want touch maybe start level set power platform encompasses hear lot seems like number permutation take maybe set stage power platform currently fit functionality platform encompasses today yeah absolutely like always start talking power platform kind like explaining important customer lot great stats idc gartner talking thing like next 5 year 500 million new apps need built apps built last 40 year longer alive huge volume apps need built additionally something like 50 oï¬ƒce work could automated today current technology tool somebody 85 organization ca understand unstructured data basically mean huge unmet need go build solution help customer usually transform course way would normally solve going hiring army developer also study saying 4 million professional developer shortfall next year going make impossible pretty expensive look mean term supply demand cost inaudible lot challenge going happen say last 20 year say little bit naive view solve challenge huge demand insuï¬ƒcient supply going teaching everybody write code go teach random people write code go teach people work finance write code tried successful scale mean mean get worse like literally used stat million developer shortfall got update 4 million developer shortfall grows every year think though way go solve call low code development low code development idea visual interactive way much like use excel powerpoint go develop solution actually get job done go knock huge chunk 500 million new apps 50 automation offering space something called power platform power platform four main product power bi data exploration visualization reporting power apps low code web mobile application development power automate low code workï¬‚ow automation robotic process automation power virtual agent low code conversational agent chatbots four product kind serve different need whether analyzing data acting automating core idea super easy get started used everybody company business user leverage professional leverage professional developer leverage either start developing first time start actually go code develop solution faster ever look space nearly 20 million monthly active user power platform today something really started go big last 3 year power platform even exist 5 year ago think opportunity massive think basically everybody earth could ultimately power platform user like everybody earth could excel user outlook user kind big think really go exciting u go look across power platform area space really strong credibility power bi far away leader basically every access gartner magic quadrant come self service bi power apps gartner come said number one low code app development platform announced 10 million monthly active user power apps alone big market leading offering think going continue grow aggressive pace like mentioned earlier power apps growing right around 200 revenue generation perspective well kind complement extends insight dynamic 365 go buy one apps want something go box easily build power platform winning combo actually dynamic power platform together inside microsoft think go closely well leverage business process transformation business value business outcome case app great shelf sometimes app got build drop power platform ton michael turrin charles lamanna michael turrin charles lamannaenergy something say definitely worth tracking next couple year kind vision continues accelerate u make lot sense one area think investor become conscious rpa power automate great story around automating repetitive task well wondering help characterize power automate fit discussion right way think use case broader wondering could help level set vision around automate yeah say view power automate today broad based automation platform today market leader feature capability adoption perspective course going great integration microsoft product like true really exciting microsoft build amazingly easy yeah yeah right lot easier people hall across street go build integration absolutely connectivity kind system key fact power automate 550 data connector available box sale force service workday sap name probably connect typical enterprise capability also recently integration company even go accelerate case power automate deeper enterprise data connectivity also power automate desktop support ui based automation classical rpa right window included window 11 support application window lot way accessibility handle computer vision ai support type app sap think used sap ui probably used power automate desktop ui automation stuck today definitely broad based rpa product place think really something unique microsoft reason think uniqueness important rpa going little bit change like internally call move like rpa cloud rpa rpa rpa 2.0 gartner call hyper automation idea automation ui macro kind gross simplification really want go deliver business value michael turrin charles lamannaand instead talk cloud rpa api connectivity deep integrated ai capability ability also ui automation also even go run manage vms cloud unintended bot people deep rpa key component recently announced azure virtual desktop integration basically run everything elastically scale infrastructure nothing deployed locally power automate one market today connector via api anyone market today cloud rpas api space super key really unlocked growth number seen hundred thousand organization organization people lot people hundred thousand organization using power automate today billion automation action every month today reason cloud rpa delivery mechanism easy get started could put power automate desktop inside window 11 people anywhere world walk powerautomate.com build bot le 60 second infrastructure required really compelling fast time value low edge case high end great case study company like used power automate simplify 11 step process cost 10 million dollar really replace email spreadsheet phone call type thing actually 4,000 solution already deployed really go broad low code accessible scale way complex absolutely think going major player look recent gartner mq show strong leader rpa well case study saw like jpmorgan put one think taught consideration rpa vendor well today lot great data power automate used broadly well narrowly lot customer another great stats couple question come audience want throw first one actually one think intending ask mean mentioned think service support early term number thing laid u start talked virtual agent seen mean seen proliferation team gotten question goal around contact center area could see microsoft investing heavily future think contact center especially next something like team yeah absolutely say absolutely area look say like contact center way implement customer support well implement thing even like revenue generation like lot company contact center sale purpose say contact center super exciting u reason number one lot great asset space already dynamic 365 customer service app module lot market share growing quickly something support agent contact center use every day work case similarly also power virtual agent automating conversational agent across web chat well social channel recently voice also lot contact center ai capability also go help basically customer automate task coaching assisting support agent whereby automating driving self service customer exciting 40 plus billion dollar year tam go look across customer cec ccars ccai three big category 40 billion tam two major disruption happening right first cloud laggard anymore mean everybody get stock cloud last saw majority like analyst majority folk still deploy core contact center infrastructure premise going go cloud like everything team super valuable built amazing call routing call distribution point presence around globe inside team infrastructure able build top go think moving cloud cloud major disruptive item second one ai like ai buzzword hear time inside contact center probably one best place map ai back business value say automate 20 customer support request 0.5 billion return investment 5 year large b2c company rare find place clear yield one point deï¬‚ection self service ai like example would call airline change ï¬‚ight instead talk agent actually talking bot saying hey want change ï¬‚ight ï¬‚ight number want change one point 10 million large customer every time make ai better another point point point would say really exciting focus u usually get opportunity come business application usually little amorphous right move u customer support agent experience better well measure return simple use contact center ai capability reduce cost prove case volume go agent drop exciting challenge u microsoft strong ai asset across already built inside oï¬ƒce inside team inside azure introducing dynamic really deliver promise meaningful michael turrin charles lamanna michael turrin charles lamannaway customer super bullish power virtual agent one important example ai automation capability customer power virtual agent bot going go service customer opposed human kind think future going much space great amazing many thing overview another question came classification characterization within dynamic 365 growth question way think much could coming replacement dynamic maybe help u understand journey transition like said two product set 365 mostly complete add characterization growth yeah think data stat shared really highlight technical diï¬ƒculty first thing say growth predominantly coming net new workload deployed customer migrating premise workload see really two stats shared number one 70 dynamic 365 revenue come cloud overall dynamic come cloud super important stat base small really meaningful actually go drive growth number second shy 50 growth also ca really converting existing customer installed base say really migration phase largely say much keep growth growth done last 12 month really requires u landing cloud workload new customer across five pillar talked earlier really five area focus lot cloud workload like power platform cloud go look lot supply chain asset cloud say definitely cloud cloud cloud day big focus sure curious prioritize internally given many direction application business evolve towards talked significant technology trend probably long list thing underneath could explore decision process informs make top versus might fall customer feedback data able analyze maybe give u sense like amazing ca imagine look like perspective michael turrin charles lamanna michael turrin charles lamannayeah would say like first foremost live breathe customer quantitatively qualitatively fairly large say like surprisingly large installed base talked really hundred thousand across power platform dynamic 365 organization interesting quantitative analysis based population understand feature used deep customer happen type thing also engineering team side work close customer thing like customer advisory board partner advisory council thing like power champion digital community lot way one one customer always center always informed go build another piece choose kind strategically want go field look like five pillar say chose five pillar around customer support supply chain service centric operation revenue generation power platform area already asset microsoft think lot disruption happening market able talk contact center customer support bit type viewpoint across five pillar certain disruption happening item number three something think accrues broader microsoft cloud story end day like biz app love biz apps important thing microsoft cloud commercial cloud position kind see lot announcement lot position also always carefully factoring contribute back overall microsoft cloud story three main lever used choose five investment area within area focus customer feedback mean make sound algorithmic clearly yeah framework guy love algorithmic sound may document internally used talk inaudible would love know fantastic well look could spend day kind chatting thing working time valuable actually run allocated today charles fantastic really appreciate joining would normally say best luck fighting irish given transition appreciate time sure michael turrinabsolutely thanks michael thanks everybody tuning look forward additional q future oï¬ „ ine thanks excellent thanks everyone joining much appreciate
