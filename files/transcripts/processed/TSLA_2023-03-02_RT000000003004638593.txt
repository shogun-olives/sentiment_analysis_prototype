good afternoon everyone good afternoon name zach kirkhorn lead finance tesla welcome investor day elon r. muskfor audience global headquarters austin texas welcome thank thank traveling joining u virtually thank part day today reﬂect back history company distinct phase product advancement technology innovation rapid volume growth recent global expansion localization model program today want talk future want talk quarter next quarter want go future divided today presentation three part first going go macro take convert earth sustainable energy generation use second want talk tesla contribution global need going go function function company meet entire leadership team going get detail team part broader goal third part going bring back talk mean company whole get started statement made presentation forward looking statement subject risk uncertainty detail found written material let get started part one elon musk drew baglino right master plan part three zach mentioning thing think wanted convey probably importantly anything else talking clear path sustainable energy earth require destroying natural habitat require u austere stop using electricity sort cold anything story think hold together quite well actually publishing detailed white paper assumption calculation clear path fully sustainable earth abundance fact could support civilization much bigger earth much 8 billion human could actually supported sustainably earth often shocked surprised people realize smart people know actually see clear path think path sustainable energy future least one sustainable current population resort extreme measure none true going walk calculation create sustainable energy civilization yes andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino set stage today energy economy let honest dirty wasteful 80 global energy primary energy come fossil fuel global energy actually end delivering useful work heat problem statement talk solution yes like going elaborate wide range technical expertise people like whatever level 9 wizard subject people engineering like gasoline car converting le third maybe 25 energy gasoline converted motion rest turned waste heat know good role lot energy required even get oil ground refine oil transport gasoline gas station look typical gasoline car actually going using le 20 fully considered energy oil actually go motion see people see people calculation take create sustainable energy earth assume energy amount required electrified civilization versus combustion civilization true energy combustion waste heat even get fuel combust first place get end use lot lost along way mean primary energy consumption 165 petawatt hour year petawatt hour trillion terawatt trillion kilowatt hour large amount energy nice thing electrified economy better way going talk eﬃciency eﬃciency along every step way actually total energy use half one enabling aspect electrifying everything sustainable energy economy much easier accomplish actually half problem statement fossil fuel economy yes conservative could better half trying assumption reasonable overly optimistic fact slightly pessimistic really better half say easy make argument need half much energy electric economy versus combustion economy elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. muskyes master plan work want talk yes thing needed large scale currently present vast amount battery energy storage rough calculation 240 terawatt hour 240,000 gigawatt hour lot battery actually achievable amount go detail yes combination electric vehicle stationary storage got solar wind got store energy wind blowing sun shining assuming sort 8 1 ratio stored energy power 30 terawatt hour power 30 terawatts power actual capital expenditure calculation manufacturing investment like 6 trillion made higher make 10 trillion across mining refining battery factory recycling vehicle factory thing going talk needing invest build sustainable energy economy yes look total world economy 100 trillion spread say 10 year would 1 global economy 20 year would 0.5 doable global economy yes big number relative global economy drew mentioned need half much energy electric economy versus combustion economy term wind solar much land would used le 0.2 land area earth think generally people realize quite much energy reaching u sun roughly gigawatt per square kilometer sun shine time multiply say four get continuous power four five give land area solar put wind solar often andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. muskplace lot place currently wind could solar double energy also put wind offshore even yes need land wind even ﬂexible put solar offshore yes earth 70 water anyway point pretty really remarkably small amount earth land area go fully sustainable yes resource raw material exist support transition go detail see insurmountable resource challenge fact end mining le ore accomplish economy currently fossil fuel economy going talk yes emphasize electrified economy require le mining current economy le andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglinoless okay plan get little detail plan basically five area work first renewable power existing grid second switch electric vehicle third switch home business industry heating heat pump fourth high temp heat delivery storage high temp industrial chemical process little bit green hydrogen chemical process need hydrogen finally sustainable sustainably fuel plane boat five area going go detail yes mean personal opinion improve energy density battery see transportation go fully electric exception rocket awkward make fuel co2 water make methane co2 water fact could electricity yes exactly fact mar hopefully get point atmosphere co2 water ice throughout mar take co2 h2o turn ch4 methane oxygen ultimately even rocket electrified first repowering existing grid renewables going consistent theme see estimate number terawatts trillion investment bottom page already actively occurring front u 60 generation added u.s. grid solar 2022 actually basis solar deployment growing 50 2022 serious upswing continue trend going behind u even know yes second switching electric vehicle 21 reduction fossil fuel use alone obviously tesla heavily engaged activity along elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. muskmany others overall ev production grew 59 2022 ev hit amazing 10 market share mean awesome milestone super excited see like yes right obviously happening rapidly mean think really car go autonomous riding gasoline car going analogous riding horse using ﬂip phone basically going situation actually took somewhat conservative assumption term many battery required ﬂeet autonomous fewer smaller ﬂeet need utility basis accounting benefit really much benefit number ﬂeet look like rough view perspective course could wrong see sort breakdown ﬂeet million vehicle goal 20 million electric vehicle year yes fewer vehicle needed least passenger vehicle autonomy debate number number le number vehicle needed today roughly 2 billion car truck operation world today yes show actually think 1.4 million yes represent 1.4 billion mean smaller ﬂeet number around presentation around 85 million vehicle year produced give sense thinking going put assumption online encourage people thought yes yes basically heading rapidly towards electric autonomous future andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino exciting yes one reason ev enabling eﬃciency point tesla model 3 4x eﬃcient well wheel toyota corolla eﬃciency getting electricity car sustainable energy economy eﬃcient car transferring stored energy motion road compared engine toyota corolla extraction refining transmission distribution gasoline toyota corolla fun reference model 3 drive mile energy take boil pot water pasta drive another mile energy took cook pasta pasta one pound model 3 like 4,000 pound give sense like like really use lot energy move model 3 object road also heat lot energy motion yes people boil pot water think yes interesting eﬃcient car next switching heat pump home business industry right heat pump meet 10 building heating need install rate growing 10 really need accelerate heat pump serve heat application 200 c business industry investment perspective see page actually lowest hanging fruit term displacing fossil fuel might saying exactly heat pump heat pump move heat create heat move heat think like natural gas furnace house like generating heat heat pump actually moving heat outside house house air conditioner refrigerator reverse surrounded heat pump like factory house really bringing displace fossil elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglinofuel heating home business industry eﬃciency perspective 3x reduction total energy required heat building real obvious thing yes heat pump car yes default yes point might make heat pump home yes maybe maybe maybe next little bit detail electrifying high temp sort industrial chemical process 50 industrial heat greater 400 c. cement steel fertilizer chemical plastic metal refining need like 1500 c. need solution ultimately equipment enables electrification carbon graphite stable 2000 2,800 c. option 1500 c range like silicon carbide material idea create store heat renewable power available sustainable energy economy renewable energy intermittent peak day got generation need make bunch heat transfer heat industrial process 24 hour day using stored heat created sun wind blowing concept hydrogen side also need green hydrogen decarbonize metal chemical refining process thing like ammonia making steel roughly 120 million ton hydrogen sourced fossil fuel today thing hydrogen also directly replace coal currently used ton steel production process called directly reducing iron replace blast furnace hydrogen reducing direct reduced iron furnace way eliminate fossil fuel aspect economy co2 associated elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk yes mean like room disagree amount hydrogen needed industrial process personal opinion hydrogen used meaningfully transport going use chemical fuel use ch4 h2 unless needed industrial process produced splitting water essentially mean done decade decade yes rocket technology yes lastly small part pie necessary part pie sustainably fueling plane boat shipping account 3 global co2 right electrification even lithium iron phosphate ship fully battery powered great opportunity electrify energy density little bit harder plane doable today improvement get underway even meantime leverage sustainable aviation fuel produced stored using excess renewable electricity lot work going space yes mean really get aircraft shipping use need redesign ship plane andrew d. baglino elon r. musk plane take advantage fact new source energy different architecture like electric car would take gasoline car stick battery suboptimal much eﬃcient battery structure car make make mass eﬃcient optimize battery say done aircraft get aircraft around cell around hour per kilogram buy right actually expensive think price come stack effort end number shared beginning presentation 30 terawatts 240 10 trillion may saying like need context feasible spoiler alert entirely feasible looking growth rate perspective much need grow deployment technology talking 3x growth rate solar wind deployment solar already growing breakneck pace wind gap going closed really quickly look electric vehicle grow 11x well grew 60 last year growth rate also going close pretty darn gap going close pretty quickly well lastly storage tesla energy storage business grown 65 cagr since 2016 global energy storage business accelerating pace well mean gap going close especially momentum transition sustainable energy accelerates course goal page 20 million ev per year 1 terawatt hour stationary storage per year basically soon investment reference point investment elon mentioned 10 one year world gdp another way thinking compare investing like invested last year fossil fuel infrastructure 60 investment actually building sustainable energy economy le extending fossil fuel economy investment basis doable look towards fit planet absolutely le 0.2 land reference point total land area intensively farmed today 12.5 land mean drive around see farm see everywhere order magnitude order magnitude difference farming talking sustainable energy land need displace farmland andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino course yes forest jungle kind ecological preserve used sparsely populated desert region barren area yes area really fit development otherwise use yes mean 0.2 fit lot place yes essentially meaningful ecological impact fact transition sustainable energy economy would result substantial reduction current ecological impact great way put yes elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglinoand mineral extraction side cartoon sort give sense ore like extracted mineral coming earth every year 68 gigatons truck gigaton look like sustainable energy economy look like fossil fuel extraction disappears replace material required fulfill sustainable energy economy actually reduces say need continue explore bring mining refining sort specific material sustainable energy economy investment mass ﬂows achievable looking already happening planet like nothing scale done already done calculated sort basis resource support transition cumulative demand move sustainable energy economy direction 2050 relative usgs resource today breaking resource bank material look really happens move forward history teach look find people think happens oh many resource next year going le going extract actually happens extract resource find see right actually occurred key material sustainable energy economy since 2000 sustainable energy economy growing tesla growing industry around u growing actual resource availability increased decreased yes seems quite bit confusion lithium lithium extremely common one common element earth country monopoly lithium even close enough lithium ore united state electrify earth united state place producing lithium enough domestic material electrify earth common limiting factor refining lithium lithium hydroxide lithium carbonate actual limiting factor true material yes like crazy technology investment need made investment gigantic need elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino elon r. musk andrew d. baglino lars moravyhappen right nickel maybe trickiest one solve showed graph maybe need like 30 world nickel known nickel reserve nickel reserve actually grown since multiple speaker yes yes exactly need nickel basically aircraft boat car truck vast majority heavy lifting electrification cell earth iron actually literally common element earth little trivia point say like earth made mass made iron anything else second oxygen everything else basically muddy rushed ball earth iron cathode sort definitely going run iron much iron insane yes yes ultimately resource extraction go effort built battery recycle battery ultimately build sustainable energy economy maintenance amount ore require really order magnitude le recycling end sustainable energy economy within reach accelerate yes mean really main message today really wanted today tesla investor stock really anyone investor earth trying convey message hope optimism hope optimism based actual physic real calculation virtual thinking earth move sustainable energy economy lifetime thank yes thank want welcome lars franz stage franz von holzhausen lars moravy franz von holzhausen lars moravy franz von holzhausen lars moravy franz von holzhausenhi hi franz lead design tesla lars vehicle franz almost 13 year joined tesla 2008 vertically integrate design company exist pretty small team tasked designing beautiful innovative vehicle planet small task 2008 lot going ev sector since focused constant improvement cost eﬃciency innovation thing continue hear today continuing design desirable car today produce car differently 10 year ago end result always exciting futuristic desirable set vehicle back handful designer engineer like great vision radically change transportation

putting huge touchscreen center vehicle something never done motortrend car year yes motortrend car year 2013 first great award first car pretty good start kind home run think whole process resulted linear process see screen designed first engineered figure manufacture lars moravy franz von holzhausen lars moravy franz von holzhausen lars moravy franz von holzhausen yes mean think really important designing car together even know going build came many even know larz inaudible true got fremont fortunate figured manufacturing solution sort like ﬂying plane putting wing building engine time knew better yes knew better order scale part master plan read model 3 needed smaller eﬃcient affordable version model equally great thing people loved model model x much affordable approached process little bit differently first time around team work together able combine design engineering manufacturing process time somewhere along way changed manufacturing process fully automated leaned whole new way manufacturing car already engineered thing quite go well planned amazing product landed u production hell many u lived carry battle scar great idea right timing like franz said automating something designed built manually super hard many many failed example fremont factory ripped eventually still work one actually worked small team engineer still running today engineer came said could longer company running running faster ever kind constraint design built manually really think despite model 3 ev ever lars moravy franz von holzhausen lars moravy franz von holzhausen lars moravy franz von holzhausen lars moravyyes model derived model 3 pas knew improve process cybertruck designed vehicle around vision actually started manufacturing process case material dictated design forming stainless steel rocket science sure easy limited way could yes absolutely really force think designing something way could normally stamp pan hole could form traditional way ended linear bending process automotive kind language manufacturing today actually created eﬃcient end process one dynamic design ever believe definitely something going change road landscape hopefully guy saw experienced definitely real real truck way build stainless steel opportunity u led u rethink factory footprint stamp huge part even paint footprint got smaller started think innovative way take constraint make great product constraint really change end result truck super dynamic truck functionality would expect competitive truck best thing coming year ideally would design engineer manufacture plan automation happening together give u opportunity question requirement something fundamentally available tesla place used work top manufacturing company world sit together yes multiple speaker franz von holzhausen lars moravy franz von holzhausen lars moravy franz von holzhausenwe one team know team together thinking process beginning fact engineering team manufacturing design automation one work report one person ca point finger solve together best way innovate traditional way making vehicle stamp build body white paint final assembly interesting shop dictated organizational structure exist dictated boundary exist factory laid something go wrong final assembly block whole line end buffering tail end manufacturing optimization henry ford first invented assembly line 1922 100 year really hard make change 100 year watch happen actually really silly guy like take stamped panel put together put framing station build body look something like car put door paint get color take door start putting interior inside car come opening already exists wish went like big piece like actually people coming car awkward movement lift car put stuff underneath put put seat car finally close glass bring door went away trip put back car time big giant car moving really nothing funny though kind whole process recently toyota called `` engineering work art true model y. lars moravy franz von holzhausen lars moravy humbling tesla good enough going scale way want rethink manufacturing part master plan make another step change cost started model made huge giga casting deleted hundred part simplified assembly model structural battery decided ﬂoor part car battery ﬂoor put seat interior battery bring big open hole assemble allowed u thing parallel fully rethinking process reducing final assembly line 10 thought maybe could place yes mean way constraint become part solution rather problem think trying say really want hammer home car 5 meter long people working around like model 3 change process take different part car time like model structural battery pack see u front part vehicle rear part vehicle mean get people working car robot working time mean better operator density le time nothing call eﬃciency nothing quantum mechanic conversation later get 44 operator density mean work le time walking back station 30 improvement eﬃciency building car slow movement robot showed production hell go automated going lot easier end probably look something like balance parallel series manufacturing way thing necessary much shorter final line blocking lot le entire rest factory optimize material ﬂow using best practice mean going look something like build side car independently paint need assemble part car put need go interior attached strategy access robot people moving heavy object around nothing mean work car time take tested put together finally assemble car one time putting side part front rear already assembled carrying ﬂoor

useful humanoid robot virtually none custom design actuator humanoid robot team designed electric motor say model plaid designed actuator robot mean practical purpose mean able bring actual product market scale useful far faster anyone else assuming thing saying true least put think true unidentified speaker elon r. musk unidentified speaker elon r. musk rebecca tinuccijust question timing start getting interesting question like ratio human humanoid robot think might greater sort see use home use robot certainly industrial us robot humanoid robot think might exceed ratio humanoid robot human even clear economy mean point since economy output per person time person output much higher limit person actual limit economy still pretty far kardashev scale getting anyway probably least understood appreciated part tesla probably worth significantly car side thing long term charge think rebecca next right talking charging charge hi name rebecca tinucci lead charging infrastructure team tesla tesla charging understood since day one great charging experience linchpin electric vehicle adoption understanding meant always taken holistic approach charging word heard lot today mean charging considered every use case think lot mean charge home even home apartment condo spend lot time thinking mean charge away home including daily commuting going road trip holistic approach led pretty incredible result 2022 provided 9 terawatt hour charging across various charging method 50 supplied via convenient ac home charging customer away home visit one 80,000 charging point includes 40,000 beloved supercharger getting meant spent ten year building charging infrastructure basically one else industry would certainly lot area want improve 10 year afforded u opportunity get pretty good charging first industry lowest deployment cost cost often 20 70 lower alternative go supercharging hardware deployment ac charging product line lot reason able achieve heard lot today vertically integrated manufacture engineer charging equipment share component across different product line supercharger side also install operate site led u pretty obsessed finding new way innovate around installation example recently extended excellence manufacturing build supercharger site unit factory giga factory new york load truck truck site crane position method save u 15 deployment cost install site matter day install site also operate really eﬃciently last year able cut per cost 40 lot reason one top list focused increasing site utilization site utilization many session push site post basically allows u spread cost session thus lower cost per kilowatt hour course easier said done push side eﬃciency course risk poor customer experience wait time site trip planner come trip planner routing navigation system electric vehicle manufacturer vehicle side data infrastructure provider site data tesla allows u use trip planner route vehicle towards available site away congested site balance utilization without risking wait time result speak last year able drive site utilization 30 mean lower per cost also cutting wait time half think get even better today feeding trip planner site information information vehicle currently site going forward moving projecting site occupancy based understanding vehicle currently routing site ultimately vision trip planner controller electric vehicle charging across infrastructure global basis last thing focused get quicker charge time really proud able accomplish shaved 30 charge time average supercharging site time visit time last year taken improvement hardware side software vehicle infrastructure really excited continue pushing trend looking forward job get easier heard earlier aspire fully electrified global ﬂeet ﬂeet industry standpoint need 9 petawatt hour charging annual basis tesla charging certainly supply require part new focus order scale first want fully electrified global ﬂeet vehicle great reliable charging experience many know recently started opening network global basis 50 supercharger europe currently open electric vehicle also opened first site australia yesterday opened first 10 supercharger site north america u.s. electric vehicle also invested lot able make really easy experience new customer sign tesla app unlock post start charging also physical site change also added hardware site called magic dock basically installed area different charging standard allow electric vehicle come site without bring adapter hardware also started installing fourth generation supercharger post installed europe first big mention big thing mention longer charging cable easily reach charge port different vehicle second thing need make sure talk scaling charging infrastructure need make sure powered renewable source proud last two year procured enough renewable energy offset amount charging provided customer look forward talk fully electrified ﬂeet global basis really want make sure demand charging closely follows renewable source available chart aggregate basis u.s. varies based renewable generation source locally basically show want kind move charging curve solar wind example mean daytime charging think best way go towards daytime charging install ac charging convenient everywhere vehicle typically parked throughout day really plan supercharging home charging definitely stay big part puzzle team currently scaling install ac charging everywhere vehicle charged day power renewable source karnbudhiraj roshan thomas karnbudhirajso summing spent 10 year installing infrastructure low cost eﬃcient provides great customer experience really getting started talk supporting masterplan part 3 got scale capacity basis 9 petawatt hour annual basis got open make charging experience everybody really great got power via renewable source one thing yes got scale infrastructure yes want power via renewable source tesla also want make sure continuing focus providing really incredible charging experience want welcome leader supply chain roshan karn talk little bit little bit topic thanks rebecca hi name karn team lead supply chain electronics powertrain battery tesla also got responsibility indirect purchasing construction procurement warehousing distribution hi name roshan tesla 14 year team manages vehicle commodity solar logistics planning capital equipment 10 year forgot today wanted provide quick overview tesla supply chain really separate u typical automotive supply chain seen presentation prior pete andrew others tesla design lot sub component go vehicle buying thing shelf supplier supply chain purely commercial relationship company actually arm within supply chain called supply industrialization engineering burden taking drawing design concept turning thousand product produced right cost right yield fall group course worked closely design engineering really level detail engineer get involved term building capability supplier pretty detailed get new part naturally electric vehicle lot supply chain exist engineer would basically take drawing turn manufacturing concept equipment selection physically go supplier stay week month however long take basically line bring line brought hitting right rate right quality right yield work thing like automation yield improvement type activity big group mechanical electrical industrial roshan thomas karnbudhirajyou name engineer within supply chain responsibility take care huge strategic advantage manage every detail supply chain integrated partner know issue happen almost live got dashboard got connection across 10,000 factory across world making component pretty good view health supplier key asset able kind manage thing lot different issue past couple year supply chain game perfection perfection passing grade like one part show line go ceo find le 20 minute tesla different apple outsource manufacturing supply chain kind right middle perfection increasingly elusive expensive kind look issue encounter past year today going talk got past going forward going get let draw attention slide left see portfolio existing portfolio product right top got x platform middle got three 3 y. think everyone familiar tesla energy platform high rate growth u see forget solar supercharger solar supercharger thank roshan see reduction basically got tier 1 tier 2 part might boring tier 1 supplier supplier build supply part directly consumption five factory tier 2 supplier basically thing tier 1 supplier supplier supplier depending supply chain one product actually go tier 6 level example talking battery cell really get involved mind like procuring lithium cobalt sort stuff procuring high volume see reduction number part x platform 3 platform great work design engineer done making car simpler easier manufacture parallel actually similar strategy supply chain cast wide net lot supplier x platform lot supplier roshan thomas karnbudhiraj roshan thomas karnbudhirajthat invited partner u used platform sort filter see supplier technical financial cultural capability match u right like invite party really scale thing really dramatically reduced number supplier dealing 3 platform approach continue future platform come along even high volume really approach made thing lot easier could figure supplier capable moving pace one desire capability need desire capability secondly complexity tier 2 level high right supplier supplier lot component think silica think resistor capacitor diode little assembly raw material raw material even yes little subassemblies come tesla complexity immense even though level talking 8,000 part total seems like lot lot management really excel like illustrate example meet car computer innocent sounding name anything absolute monster manage think seen picture left autopilot board top autopilot board autopilot board also bottom bottom populated heavily component side heat sink got mcu multimedia cluster board board equally complex also eight layered board computer run hard peak operation liquid cooled heat sink assembly requires taking two board bonding heat sink hermetically sealed assembly course ﬂashing software sort stuff one part number come tesla example one tier 1 part number complex assembly manage tier 2 level 7,000 component stand component assembled onto car computer every 1.4 roshan thomas karnbudhiraj roshan thomas karnbudhiraj roshan thomasmilliseconds line build computer length football field quite complicated initially first started building board due complexity rely heavily labor dial quality rate yield started focusing making eﬃcient way control cost removing labor first step removing labor second step fully automating third step turning light letting factory run ideally going goal u 95 work done going going lot illustrates point part part part lot complexity underneath supply chain game multiple tier made u successful involvement detail supplier engineer tesla employee tesla supply engineer like payroll go capability supplier managing every attribute 7,000 day chip shortage pandemic stuff deal diﬃcult manage detail able pull course supply chain part also logistics lot thing hand roshan sharing stats yeah talking board complexity course last year moved 16 million pallet supplier factory visualize put pallet could cover half circumference earth talking tier 2 complexity 1 billion electronic component get moved every week support production karn team manages right 1 billion component week right 52 billion year going go way top also responsibility make sure right component supplied right service location support growing ﬂeet vehicle 685 service center component need show time also result pandemic even karnbudhiraj roshan thomas karnbudhiraj roshan thomas karnbudhiraj roshan thomaswe working dual sourcing triple sourcing critical component result supplier around 45 country world yeah approach really bring manufacturing subcomponents closer point consumption make supply chain green burning diesel moving stuff around also give u security supply multiple source case one factory get taken o  ine got pandemic also yeah last three year incredibly hard karn used look lot younger covid serious note pandemic really changed game supply chain management regular supply chain person rolling sleeve negotiating state government city manager mayor help supplier restart operation really inspiring story supply chain team really fought hard make sure factory go also testament resilience supply partner said resilience attitude also laid foundation dual source also many instance many thing simplified part simplified supply chain design simplified due able get pandemic much better shape rest automotive forced u adapt encountered issue one time really team effort heavily relied government relation team literally covid pandemic aware happened different country different time unfortunately need part make car given point one factory lying right karnbudhiraj roshan thomas karnbudhiraj roshan thomas karnbudhirajthere one jurisdiction want wanted shut factory outbreak learning rule understanding coming argument point leveraging team getting diﬃcult good experience exactly learned lot yeah figuring work covid port congestion hit west coast logistics lead time went twice amount operating le 35 accuracy system mean given point eta vessel 75 figure work chip shortage hit yeah chip shortage nightmare got mean think testament tenacity team resilience supplier partner mostly behind u think result speak tesla able grow production volume time rest industry hard time staying ﬂat think shrunk actually cumulatively often asked question manage answer much kind baked presentation today first designed electronics order control cost really go build relationship tier 2 supplier negotiate directly relationship formed ten year ago really gotten know well shortage hit knew escalate call ask help really kind swarming issue point constraint best team strong relationship vendor also pretty sophisticated capacity planning function tier 2 capacity need come earlier tier 1 capacity tier 3 capacity even earlier team good job strategic alignment partner make sure capacity ready need roshan thomaswe company goal put many ev let pandemic phase u full throttle pedal metal term demand signal also helped silicon industry long lead time invest billion dollar sophisticated fabs take year build stability demand something appreciate something much tesla thing looking back right got got 0 40,000 car week let talk get 20 million question get asked tesla going basically break chip industry grow 20 million vehicle answer let walk logic stand right tesla enabled full computer four time silicon content regular vehicle 2 million run rate consuming 700,000 wafer equivalent industry churn thrown around capacity silicon much using little bit million global wafer capacity based estimate seen 135 million 0.5 industry lot get 20 million get 20 million make simplification term part count also separate work stream think colin talked pete talked going different component really going simplify architecture simpler better even take pessimistic case going need 8 million wafer okay industry going scale 200 million point still le 5 market share run offense ran along continue work partner invest fabs invest capacity capacity ready time need really see impediment supply chain perspective get 20 million would like talk page took electronic playbook applied mechanical side vehicle use currently heat pump base technology thermal system heat pump vehicle used dispersed thermal system connected hose engineering inspired circuit board created system extremely integrated 60 system size basketball contained 100 component 50 sealing interface several different manufacturing process packaged tight size talking well launched system right outbreak pandemic model team forced manage component different supplier around world remotely four video playing time one video manual line created started production manual line produced lot quality issue let alone throughput quickly pivoted line karnbudhiraj roshan thomas karnbudhirajbut spite although three throughput great quality issue sustained team decided fully automated way go automate line created 3d simulation many company team capability point part get packed ability create 3d simulation complex subassemblies would involved making part tell supplier exactly equipment purchase test create line simulation help simulation detailed subassembly cell juxtaposed supplier factory layout iteration optimizing process implemented fully automated line le eight month result remarkable 99 reduction labor force line would need thousand associate build super manifold full volume take 10 associate quality also went order magnitude defect rate le 0.005 super manifold roll every 7 second created many automated line factory size two football field way roshan inaudible one 99 two football field talking world labor cost increasing labor participation decreasing huge turnover cost implementing automation going 3x next 10 year thinking complex assembly going push type thinking supply base building complex assembly way think confidently scale 20 million vehicle target summarize laid foundation getting ready execute masterplan 3 strategy supply chain design simplification going make sure control tier supply chain going grow responsibly sustainably partner automate yeah going 0 40,000 car week tough mean took lot trial error took lot learning lot pain lot mental scar tissue elon call process level foundation set going 40 400 going really phase u capable team got capable external partner gone hell leadership team galvanized behind mission tom zhuwe going get done like thank time hand drew tom next presentation thank hi everyone name tom zhu responsible global production sale delivery service joined company back 2014 running company business greater china apac today representing giga factory talk make car faster right four vehicle factory three continent serve market total number manufacturing employee 65,000 also including amazing team reno making powertrains battery pack drive unit vehicle factory total installed capacity vehicle factory 2 million car year said always looking opportunity grow capacity existing footprint expect number grow time build factory start build car certainly expert image showing progress made back 2019 build gig factory shanghai nine half month time built greenfield project established vehicle factory three month later started deliver first customer vehicle people always ask tesla build factory fast really learned free manufacturer lot talked survivor production tried avoid mistake made decided design straight line minimum number down turn easier manufacturing ability easier construction also challenged assumption people ever know build vehicle factory deleted simplified redundancy buffer helped u save lot time also strong construction team tesla ever job done others better bring house construction team full control activity site design engineering construction site management team build giga shanghai also build giga berlin giga texas giga nevada really hero behind scene like larson shared earlier going forward new platform modular design intensified gigafactory able make car even reduce footprint also mean build factory time drawing manufacturing team around globe happy share early morning hit 4 million mark total tesla ever built 4 million vehicle actually built factory took tour shop ﬂoor probably looked past right took u 12 year build first million vehicle 18 month second building second million third million unidentified speaker tom zhu unidentified speaker tom zhutook u 11 month shortly le seven month built four million car getting better faster exponential growth really kudos team take run giga factory well 600 robot 10,000 trained employee 5,000 human 5,000 optimus 100 process sound simple extremely hard two key metric predominantly focused overall equipment effectiveness cycle time tesla setting passing grade vehicle factory 90 oee cycle time mean oee really evaluate equipment uptime machine performance quality simply put actual production time good quality product versus plan productive time higher better 45 second cycle time mean expect every 45 second car rolling final assembly line factory faster rent faster get economy scale look chart right left shanghai able significantly drop labor hour per car ramp little dip happened last q2 2022 covid shutdown right fremont model shop even 6 year old facility team still able optimize material ﬂow eliminate single point failure drive higher output hence reduce labor hour actually factory keep setting new record yesterday new factory daily record congrats fremont team absolutely reduce cycle time keep improving eﬃciency followed philosophy elon shared building rocket questioning basically found right problem solve start delete simplify try accelerate pressurize line find solution actually work last think automation one example gigafactory shanghaiing paint shop find overlap baking range pvc sealer top coat done two different oven decided combine two process eventually helped u help u reduce cycle time also save 9 energy consumption 9 co2 emission andrew d. baglinoalso communized x design fremont right common body common headlamp eliminated 40 part reduced 10 cycle time improvement really help u get faster ramp trajectory learn high volume existing factory also learned new factory recently gig berlin factory team implemented 5g private network shop ﬂoor helped u overcome 90 cycle issue particular process ga shop going soon implement globally right integrated global organization production way sale delivery service help u strength feedback loop manufacturing service obviously want bring delight customer ownership experience car owner direct feedback loop able turn customer escalation feedback quick action improvement shop ﬂoor immediately effort past six month able reduce time service early ownership service also service appointment time significantly four factory enough want hit 20 million car year target going keep building new factory new line come new product well giga factory one organization would able replicate unified idea across factory also help new factory rent faster also produce better quality lower cost going hand drew talk cell manufacturing thanks tom yeah talking new vehicle factory also new cell factory going talk follow model first thought provide little bit update cell production remember battery day showed video spoon went dry powder film let say spoon many room saw tour today dry electrode machine texas one line installed fully automated spoon powder foil coated electrode peak productivity perspective per tool perspective 20x productivity tool showed folk tour inaudible back battery day made lot progress key one key part cell manufacturing process also continued focus refining way make cell factory cell go inside see chart typical 2,170 cylindrical cell 4,680 made huge leap basically 5x reduction factory footprint volume footprint going fremont pilot line texas improved improving go nevada actually represents series action taken integrated holistic design team across product design michael snydermanufacturing design process design equipment design facility design need work together make happen see bottom example simplicity investment scaling part reduced number part cell number process significant reduction number process collaborating five design group able result build end factory 10x smaller volumetrically mean faster get built much lower capex per gigawatt hour output go scale objective 240 total 1 terawatt year stationary storage 20 million vehicle year scalability required achieve goal looking cell factory also upstream material necessary see rendering 50 gigawatt hour year corpus christi lithium refinery already broken ground texas facility start commissioning end 2023 year good example something basically talking breaking ground starting commissioning within 10 month actual production within 12 month target similar shanghai result collaboration internal execution construction partnership local community third site 30 minute corpus christi port located directly rail process route taking direct soda ash leach input material mean acid roasting sort waste product associated acid roasting step designed consume lithium spodumene commonly traded lithium rock ﬂexible feed primary secondary source similarly working cathode facility texas maybe seen driving around 60 year cathode facility behind main building 10 month build time well install equipment installed first line speak commissioning starting next quarter need plan always lot confident company also trying sort accelerate pace industry trying new thing little bit scalable certain innovation improve productivity per term capex per thing like think sum effort factory side mike want come talk energy right take away right hello everyone name mike

tesla leader power electronics deployed 1.4 terawatts across energy storage vehicle deliver power electronics solar wind industry combined per annum basis power electronics hard overstate impactful really glue sustainable energy economy generation storage power electronics device switching thousand time per second hundred thousand time per second eﬃciently react whatever needed either car grid like sort software driven core provide functionality available grid past one reason renewables storage together great solution michael snyder andrew d. baglino michael snyder andrew d. baglino michael snyder yeah one reason focus power electronics control much impact project directly example left firmware feature call virtual machine mode virtual machine mode contributes grid stability like car shock absorber dampens oscillation vibration keep ride smooth imagine dampen vibration vehicle could lose control someone could get hurt grid could blackout one grid operator utilizing virtual machine mode said operate grid 100 renewables unless feature unless virtual machine mode working yeah tried work well virtually virtual machine inaudible like synthetic inertia turn battery power plant like software behaving like giant spinning machine literally like inertia stabilizes grid need giant spinning machine need like huge fossil fuel power plant giant hydro turbine going battery program whatever need part grid even dynamically changing grid condition change right focus much believe future battery going add value going adding power stability energy autobidder another software feature wanted mention autobidder autonomous energy trading platform basic sens buying energy low selling high owner net difference operating battery storage actually complex upwards needing upwards hundred even thousand decision every 5 minute much complex pv solar plant wind plant thermal battery thermal generation plant mostly versatility ability battery provide much value different way decision need made real time andrew d. baglinoorder optimize get value battery solution existed market built one market market deployed australia texas uk proven market leader continuing invest autobidder expand new market second point got relentless focus speed execution two point made first one building factory seeing time lapse mega factory built lathrop took jc penney distribution center manufacturing facility le 12 month incredible really way similar colleague described leveraging vertical integration tesla getting vehicle manufacturing team room construction engineering making decision quickly decision stakeholder using lesson learned lathrop speak plan next factory second installing project faster mentioned already kind core going past four year increased installation speed 4x reduced total labor involved across construction manufacturing 3x think key unlocking ability scale customer ability scale u need make laser focused reducing time megapack leaf factory operational grid centralized storage also distributed storage future roadmap inaudible tesla maybe know sort retail plan texas wanted talk little bit fit together tesla electric really unlocks full value distributed energy storage product enables customer become utility data page south australia virtual power plant another tesla electric setup 2022 5,000 customer data get sense happening provided default utility service looked cost serving electricity average 140 month solar powerwall solar powerwall interacting grid participating energy market cost serving customer would go would half go 140 month 70 month tesla electric operating asset intelligent way benefit grid tesla electric basically software developed autobidder purpose distributed energy resource actually pay customer bring energy service grid

worst case scenario 100 coal grid model 3 le emission average ice car going get better heard today every product make eﬃcient every factory build sustainable going get better better build future talking stakeholder shareholder improve reporting framework aligning tcdf tcfd aligning tcfd know many asking u also want stay tuned going much coming impact report thank next zach kirkhorn thank laurie right last section prepared remark today kind take discussed today summarize corporate level financials maybe jump detail never done investor day company never brought leadership team asked talk thing working feel fortunate able work alongside group people support team also want thank room back listening work put today getting company today thank tesla team preparing today folk asking well zach talk really guidance gave folk well talk thing working talk context master plan almost everybody talk today great detail work take cost industry business survive die based upon ability manage cost like talk cost well look scale production product model 3 reached 5,000 car per week design capacity mid 2018 since taken 30 cost product two point want make first cost reduction heard throughout course day deeply ingrained culture think one important reason today company second point want make working cost reduction easy take cost make product worse take cost improve product time hard thing necessary thing continue move forward look version model 3 built today compare back model 3 built 2018 long list improvement put car also taking cost product cost reduction come one place silver bullet push boundary volume model 3 program increasing volume 3x period time improved productivity fremont factory twice productive mid 2018 made lot progress overhead eﬃciencies product improvement discussed long list thing including localization factory shanghai ramp volume find eﬃciencies work supplier lead material cost reduction improve affordability product look forward vehicle target reduce 50 cost talked bit earlier today going model x platform 3 platform took 50 cost task important improve affordability number customer access product dramatically increase link back master plan enables exponential growth volume linear reduction cost product second point make cost reduction come single one place see bucket vehicle side battery powertrain manufacturing cost reduction others bucket relatively equal size order take 50 cost product go everything importantly cost car upfront transitioning sustainable economy particularly vehicle ownership really important think lifetime cost product chart showing total cost ownership per mile course five year think financing cost insurance cost cost power drew ph talked little bit plan texas wear tear maintenance car et cetera already place today u.s. base model 3 cost per mile basis le toyota corolla highest selling car world move towards platform continue reduce work robotaxi variant platform cost come even even product expect substantially lower cost per mile highest volume product world next thing cost reduction want talk operating expense spent lot time earnings call talking gross margin product cost spend lot time talking opex think one really important part story since 2018 reduced opex 60 percent revenue 75 per delivered car basis quite staggering want go detail done first component opex r single important thing constrain number program work minimizing number program running parallel key maximize revenue cash generated every program work also maximize technology sharing program talked little bit power electronics energy business shared power electronics vehicle business look sg side think story pretty dramatic showing comparison sg per car delivered compared traditional auto industry oem dealership network estimate 60 70 lower per car basis turn dollar many thousand dollar per car part reason last earnings call made comment think operating margin gross margin company integration sg side particularly vertical integration dealership network provides eﬃciencies give u competitive advantage cost structure standpoint relative company thing note always case long ago bar would inverted go back little bit time talk launched model 3 fremont factory went 2,000 car per week x adding 5,000 week model 3 got u 7,000 car week heard folk today talk production hell think ever talked company back oﬃce operation hell also happened time 7,000 car week 350,000 car year want go 20 million car year struggling 7,000 saying completely rethink way managing oﬃce operation hope eﬃciently scaling company began process still continuing work today something refer tesla operating system way vertically integrated software manages car also vertically integrated software run company major department company using yet almost using software recently removed recruiting software running recruiting software company matter lot rather complex web system generic solution take lot effort customize particular need able put place application engineering team dedicated lightweight software need nothing team work closely process improvement team sit within business looking process managing company following exact process tom mentioned manufacturing space look process delete process step need simplify process step existing automate remaining result quite staggering frank think exceeded expectation well left side chart example eﬃciency improvement seen within sg area result strategy north american sale team four time eﬃcient 2018 order operation team financial service mean level improvement large enough pixel slide list everything couple example way look take cost product want feature product improve product taking cost true use tesla operating system integration process improvement team within company increased performance added capability also dramatically reducing cost per car basis list functionality put place customer like also simplifies operation behind scene used tesla operating system expand captive insurance phase fully vertically integrated run software agent claim software claim folk run insurance business also important technology company data important use system access data system pull extremely granular targeted reporting enables u see every aspect business real time make adjustment operation needed sometimes example say man wish tracking piece data well team meeting away application engineering team make request start tracking data make change feedback loop associated process improvement inside company pretty astounding last thing mention something personally quite proud made lot progress closed process within finance team getting filed amongst fastest 20 largest market cap company great work finance team work cost reduction extremely important lot money spend ahead u achieve goal within master plan mentioned course day today 20 million annual vehicle production target 1 terawatt hour annual energy storage production expanding cell production service charging line growth business estimated think total cost get certainly error bar around number continue progress innovate spent 28 billion far history company maybe total investment look large actually think quite small relative ambition look 2022 operating cash ﬂows say well let assume modest growth maybe much conservative ability pay level investment forecast achievable u often asked capital allocation think strategy straightforward touched upon little bit last slide explicit obviously priority ensure using capital run operation business working capital intensive business elon r. muskand managed carefully course quarter swing cash balance depending upon timing build deliver car obviously plenty set aside downside protection another really important area money set aside last couple year throughout pandemic think highlight ready downside protection important preserving daily operation engine generates cash allows u reinvest growth business proud last couple year despite ups down macro environment interruption supply chain never pulled back investment growth remains huge priority u investing growth look opportunistic way spend cash financially oriented return exceeds hurdle place cash part story cost reduction fremont factory excess side board meet regular basis thinking cash ﬂow projection looking forward whether make sense buyback dividend wrap finance portion presentation today couple key message want leave use innovation intense level drive cost improve eﬃciency business reason important allows u improve product affordability particularly case move next generation platform improving affordability allows u comfortably make investment grow volume volume generates cash allows u make investment integrate going forward belief leadership team tesla going achieve unprecedented scale manufacturing space ultimately required accelerate world transition sustainable energy completes prepared portion today going take short break resume live q thank much right well let see probably significant announcement day excited announce going building gigafactory mexico yes obviously grand opening groundbreaking whatnot excited announce next tesla gigafactory mexico near monterrey excited unidentified speaker operator q rod lache elon r. musknow want emphasize continue expand production existing factory including california nevada texas obviously well shanghai intend increase production factory giga mexico would supplemental output factory clear moving output anywhere anywhere simply expanding total global output yeah going good yeah okay laurie think yeah quite excited announce fact believe governor hard see welcome secretary state believe anyway look forward big event great groundbreaking opening let see move guess q obviously got significant bench strength probably like bench maybe many people stage try answer question within reason yeah meant kind sort discussion opposed production rest quarter type thing let try orient question towards value creation fire away rod question answer question answer hi rod lache wolfe research exciting plan vehicle powertrains battery hoping maybe talk u little bit timeline deploying sound like vehicle kind paradigm change vehicle assembled battery put together everything also get reconfigured everything model y built built differently future maybe give u feel happens timeline implementation well talk little bit broadly speaking profound architectural change future vehicle retooling factory mean bringing factory extended period time prefer think variant model produced got variant unidentified speaker q adam jonas elon r. musk unidentified speakerwhere rear casting front rear casting structural battery pack number small improvement occur think really really big change would future vehicle yeah know guy want add inaudible yeah mean far agree 100 elon really easy put innovation new vehicle obviously bring back always talked want take factory far timeline go going go fast left right always elon alluded fact mexico build next gen vehicle also plant really getting running expect huge volume product going move quickly next couple year let go adam thanks first another winner mexico foreign language great congratulation elon question applying first principle thinking innovation area seemingly outside control mining extraction key material believe couple year ago patent sodium chloride extract lithium clay spodumene clay thing nature fit plan maybe bringing real innovation mining sector could use little maybe waking getting cost could real gating factor seems well going address whatever think limiting factor point time would like least amount possible want get mining refining sector think focus really refining capacity need make giant ph amount anode cathode lithium lithium hydroxide lithium carbonate really refining capacity biggest choke point yeah building lithium refinery corpus christi term mining company looking part value chain large supplier lithium right aware approaching corpus refinery technology trying reason making aware think fundamentally scalable proved plan share elon say really like want thing happening fast enough elon r. musk unidentified speaker q analyst elon r. musk unidentified speakerso prove done faster intention transfer knowledge large current supplier actually true actually clay process playing continue work true worked supplier well trial sharing knowledge intention help whole world better ultimately year getting lithium whatever ore. obviously building cathode processing facility adjacent building little road see another large construction cathode refining prefer others know want yes case really cathode production united state needed done going going try first principle perspective tried bunch new thing confident work prove want bring back supplier build new facility quickly le investment right let go ben hi ben kehler ph baird similar renewable side tesla nudge rest renewable industry speed since big pillar master plan 3 well know say like entrepreneur want like guaranteed chance success would refining lithium anode cathode material whatsoever lithium ion cell brainer yes everything yeah renewable energy thing thing tesla reduce cost storage reduce cost stationary storage bring like ﬂexible load grid form like car charging right time valuable renewables texas right joking like lot wind night wind like almost much wind want turn nuke whatever bringing really low cost storage onto grid make renewables valuable ultimately accelerate deployment focus guess q analyst unidentified speaker elon r. musk unidentified speaker elon r. musk q analystyeah philippe thank inaudible jefferies got two question first one think industry everybody want tesla every car marker trying emulate done one thing focus much growth possible model ph possible trying understand aim 20 million unit 2030 many model think need get fit drive hyperscale manage also fact probably consumer point want see tesla tesla every street corner trying get sense question bidirectional mean talked lot making world renewables better usage car think bidirectional charging one way better using car seem reluctant past wondering latest view topic sure bidirectional like conscious decision priority time think maybe way think looked continue improve power electronics vehicle found way bring bidirectionality actually reducing cost power electronics vehicle thing tesla goal usually get le middle kind like power electronics retool would say bring functionality vehicle next two year let say yeah guess say yeah think many people going use bidirectional charging unless powerwall unplug car house go dark extremely inconvenient yes value come charging car right time really sending energy way yes powerwall take house load use car supplementary energy source power wall going drive everyone crazy unplugging car house go think value supplemental energy source road powerwall diminished convenience people house elon r. musk q analyst elon r. musk q george gianarikas elon r. musk unidentified speakerand question number model sorry many model vehicle model many really 10 know many mean happened conventional car people run thing run thing end reshu  ing deck pretty much many variant car road like hundred good variant mostly variant sake variant look thing converged phone used hundred ﬂip phone like george gianarikas canaccord genuity question plan grow market share china also whether political tension united state china impact ambition thank hey tom sweat hard yeah well still growing market share china quite strongly actually especially earlier year price adjustment actually generated huge demand produce really elon said long offer product value affordable price worry demand basically philosophy follow try everything cut cost supply chain improve eﬃciency factory pas add value customer think guy long continue concerned market share china second part geopolitical one know best actually create lot job local community generated also supplier factory create lot job well contributed lot local economy think long needed country see much risk colin q colin rusch elon r. musk unidentified speaker elon r. musk unidentified speaker colin rush oppenheimer one thing struck presentation operational eﬃciency metric guy talking could talk little bit velocity learning cycle guy track think organization work variety area innovation perspective anyone want try say one high level thing ca improve something measure like ruthless measurer tesla start measuring thing contribute operational eﬃciency actually path something guess key good measuring stick okay something say respect demand said time year sometimes need said overwhelmingly desire people tesla extremely high limiting factor ability pay tesla want tesla easy people room lose sight income far excess car cost look value money consider affordability vast majority people affordability driven simply double price car could say think thing limit infinitely desirable car cost 10 million would matter people demand much function affordability desire important one thing sure price elasticity demand tesla like lower price much demand increase found even small change price big effect demand big good thing learn yeah autonomy question big could potentially know five time utility asset currently passenger car 10 12 hour week usage plus lot parking expense autonomous car could 50 60 hour week something like could get rid lot parking expense true autonomy effectively turned ﬂeet may probably biggest asset value increase history overnight emmanuel q emmanuel rosner elon r. musk unidentified speaker thank much emmanuel rosner deutsche bank start launching next generation vehicle ramping volume nearest term priority term segment vehicle focus slide showed two vehicle right seemed based form factor one maybe look like van one look like maybe like smaller vehicle like potentially model 2 guess nearest focus term ramping vehicle make sure lowering price point much cost going 50 cannibalizing demand existing vehicle alright demand vehicle term desire may well infinite indistinguishable infinite point affordability matter make car affordable demand go crazy basically issue build car hard part building car ca emphasize enough hard part building car entire supply chain go car logistics challenge extraordinary diﬃculty thing go car scale car everything exponential ramp miss even one thing matter earthquake ﬂood fire revolution thought heard part supply chain get interrupted seizure hard part building car far supply chain go guy want talk supply chain though yeah yeah well might presentation mentioned perfection passing grade really need everything happen perfectly strategy mitigating different risk anticipated really bespoke situation really unique subject matter expertise deep knowledge particular supply chain managing come strategy seen everything elon mentioned first tariff ﬂew back forth ocean logistics issue chip shortage covid ﬂoods fire fab japan knocked massive covid spike malaysia lot chip backend lot chip one elon involved well yeah wrecking somehow work yeah diﬃcult think laying foundation intimate tier supply chain building control directing elon r. muskthe different tier supply chain way trying mitigate risk come dual sourcing triple sourcing redundancy way trying mitigate yes fine think vehicle think three wire architecture sx architecture next generation platform one segment really thinking segment available captured market would designing supply chain partner go quickly segment need elon point make car desirable affordable oftentimes necessarily matter segment one want seen model 3 lot people thought sedan going great hit sell ton next generation platform one vehicle multiple segment really try focus affordability desirability point started yes mean think old saying like battle tactic logistics logistics challenge enormous start like significant percentage industry ca overcapacitize realistic thing like said like dual source triple source maybe small thing ca big thing triple sourced one like plane three engine three engine fails crash either overcapacitize drive capex idle supplier somewhere big warehouse design overage reasonable expedited cost inevitably something go wrong somewhere got ﬂy thing around really rate progress rate able scale 10,000 logistics problem significant cell production actually deliberately try overdo cell production cell supply exceed needed vehicle go needed vehicle factory stall extra cell like well okay much easier thing scale powerwall megapack output stationary storage overcapacitize cell pack scale production stationary storage much easier scale vehicle production strategically think good thing yes capex megapack tiny compared capex vehicle also megapack demand basically long competitive utility going tell many quasi infinite demand really unidentified speaker q dan levy unidentified speakertera many terawatt hour got long way go get many terawatt hour per year dan let go dan thank dan levy barclays think know competitive dynamic differ significantly region cost dynamic differ region saw china gigafactory far superior cost inaudible factory clearly different dynamic extent cost strategy laid today differ region global approach reducing cost yeah think pretty consistent strategy try much localize possible like china 95 95 supply chain localized way second tier third tier gave u generated tremendous saving cog also localized labor force access skilled labor force region yangtze delta region shanghai particularly referring among 30,000 employee china probably le 20 expat deep localization done able cost structure try replicate approach elsewhere different giga factory course supplier base different labor market different region region country country try best localize yeah think absolutely give u advantage compete auto em around globe another thing direct ph selling mode like zach said would save tremendous money opex well full control expenditure across company spend money marketing advertising everything saved become value offer consumer part also follow pretty consistent strategy year mean certainly manufacturing stuff colin pete talked whether make make europe make asia applies everywhere think ground specific region yes one thing would add tom point localization lars ph point would actually say moving direction standardization term factory process cost reduction approach thinking next generation platform thinking volume aspire build many individual factory need build fastest possible way expand footprint around world q analyst zachary kirkhorn q ashok elluswamywhat done model factory incremental improvement previous factory requires engineering hour engineering spend factory design end factory slightly different move towards next generation platform think term used lars get right first time certainly thing learn make adjustment try much standardization communalization possible allows u go quickly possible expansion inaudible thanks two question one zach one ashok zach think growth operating margin business look 150 billion 175 billion capex remaining balance essentially capex guidance 2030 ashok reconstruction highlighted different mobile light rem map give u color ap hardware respect operating margin intend continue improve operating expense percentage revenue time continuing take cost product try keep gross margin place healthy well hardware perspective business know expectation continue stay healthy place time software portion top elon commented many time impact full driving software economics business space profitability operating margin would impacted dramatically specifically point capex guidance intent slide provide specific guidance transparent internally rough estimate provide context think getting 20 million vehicle per year one terawatt hour energy storage feasible relative expected cash generation business number move learn may choose vertically integrate thing may find eﬃciencies elsewhere whole conversation earlier mining mining entire point say something entirely possible based upon forecast regarding reconstruction point trying make want auto label data collect data ﬂeet reconstruct local area act supervision trip since want build scalable system want really rely hd map elon r. musk unidentified speaker q alex potter andrew d. baglinoanything even though could like trivially build something using technology mostly auto leveling provides like precise 3d label video sequence involved reconstruction something know touched much term training one biggest neural net training system world expect increase believe order magnitude end year probably another order magnitude end next year combination nvidia dojo much scale quite inaudible people enormous maybe final two question one alex one chris okay alex potter piper definitely want ask drew anybody else update dry battery electrode right try towards cell scale lot clearly lot moving piece complex sort orchestra supply chain lot come drive battery electrode least trending fascinating part factory tour looking window seeing clearly science project anything willing disclose yield progress today versus thought going yeah thanks yes mean saw right like real factory making lot dry electrode automated fashion made lot progress spectrum like perfectionist clear end goal every week go making progress towards end goal whether speed tool yield process downstream process installed yet rate progress either anode cathode side think great thing overcapacity elon mentioned giving u opportunity experiment go rather like stock something happen kick ago something elon said team many time okay scrap equipment money okay scrap time way approaching u probabilistically think likely thing succeed even actually factory saw one anode line actually operating two slightly different version final process step powder entering tool competition going higher yield going perform better elon r. musk unidentified speaker operator unidentified speaker elon r. musk unidentified speakerluxury able taking full advantage advance technology quickly possible dry electrode problem really quite hard problem acquired maxwell really dry electrode technology illustrates gigantic gap something working small scale large scale extremely talented team engineer working scaling dry electrode process reliable consistent grinding hard literally figuratively quite seems likely able scale volume year yes yes mean basically increasing output week week like roughly 1,000 week per quarter internal target tracking think saw effectively like ton material per hour per tool kind like hard like rationalize like really mean different like oh something work lab like ton material per hour different kind problem like even like 0.1 escape like find enclosure equipment dust problem like could short electronics like thing like lab scale even notice thousand ton course month like oh new failure mode found knocking though team grinding progress every week last question chris thanks taking question vehicle first think get look maybe prototype second detail think share term size content performance third think mentioned would produce plant addition mexico take mean launch existing plant finished constructing new plant mexico think actually probably decline answer proper sort product event would jumping gun answer question maybe another question yes know anyone q analyst elon r. musk q ashok elluswamy elon r. musk q ashok elluswamy elon r. musk q ashok elluswamy elon r. muskwell inaudible two question really impressive afternoon thank much elon curious doubled double learned sort managing larger enterprise might manage bigger enterprise secondly curious thought generative ai rapid breakthrough ai last month could help make car sort le hard make thank see ai helping u make car anytime soon point mean point u working big problem chill mean little worried ai stuff think something know concerned think think need kind like regulatory authority something overseeing ai development making sure operating within public interest quite dangerous technology fear may done thing accelerate know ai stuff think obviously useful like people think agi type problem think quite agi problem certainly requires sophisticated neural net road system designed eye biological neural net naturally analog camera digital neural net thing found actually look neural net architecture cart kind insane frankly net upon net upon net upon net yeah visualization tool crash open yeah complicated yeah like complicated one visualize right unidentified speaker elon r. musk unidentified speakeryeah hard like literally look insane guess something like happening brain drive around pretty well know like tesla good thing ai know one stress know think say know okay given 7 think time thank much coming thank see later
