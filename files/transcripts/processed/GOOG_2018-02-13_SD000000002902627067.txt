thanks much heather going quickly go update google cloud get question okay level set google cloud say google cloud secure open leading technology google cloud platform service way g suite secure productivity tool suite google cloud point entire google cloud think highly differentiated got security every layer think secure place information communication google cloud platform differentiated data analytics machine learning also differentiated open approach modern developer environment g suite productivity suite believe maybe one support authentication tremendous collaborative ability lot ai getting infused might noticed google earnings call february 1 finally put metric google cloud said 2017 surpassed 1 billion quarter run rate google cloud platform google cloud business said google cloud platform growing public cloud trailing 4 quarter could look metric like g suite passed 4 million paying company point completely organization customer partner alphabet google excited business 2016 2017 largest driver new headcount addition alphabet business fueling people also lot enterprise expertise hired executive usual suspect talented group people working extraordinarily hard really built function training professional service customer engineering architect starting really pay also forged big enterprise strategic partnership market sap sale running sap offering cloud already salesforce around integrating google analytics ad data google bigquery also around g suite cisco around open hybrid environment pivotal dell number big enterprise partnership help u along work channel system integrator done first thing really gear engineering take phenomenal technology make remove every deal blocker enterprise might happy say end last year really done encryption key networking

whole thing people q heather anne bellini diane b. greene q heather anne bellini diane b. greene q heather anne bellini diane b. greene q heather anne belliniclearly important player point `` well clearly good technology really serve enterprise serving enterprise increasingly well get question le le yes okay key area focus customer top couple thing development wish list creating want next gcp think overall customer want everything easier easier use want understand move actually phenomenal story done taken kubernetes orchestration deal monitoring made work cloud go customer say `` look developing develop google place push 2,000 push day yet last two year according cloudharmony owned gartner highly available cloud affecting availability company everywhere agility keep using container architecture everybody realizes move modern agile environment way cloud lot work customer around course immense amount work around data make smart combine interesting data smart data proprietary becoming key part business competitive ... iot pretty interesting area right sitting cio asked `` top 3 competitive advantage versus cloud provider would 3 thing diane b. greene q heather anne bellini diane b. greene q heather anne bellini diane b. greene yes well say security first foremost simply think anyone afford secure possible discover major problem like speck hammer heartbleed also like 1.4 billion gmail account see everything tell `` hi someone gave away password sure wanted going let log want change password even sophisticated increasingly gcp say security important data analytics machine learning ai ... okay kubernetes would ... third open approach one thing say open reason important pace technology fast used something run everywhere standard body people would elect people go meeting would proceed glacial pace something really need run everywhere like kubernetes tensorflow open source standard change code move fast modern way letting world useful standard pushed anybody really proud stance google taken touched little bit slide one area focus investment community gcp guess go little bit detail done regarding enterprise sale footprint think pace investment needed well

enterprise force u everything customer need know take care volume thing want really healthy mix across every segment right question audience go one first come think question take enterprise going innovate abcd ai big data cloud data got google tensorflow got gcp cloud platform inspiring working enterprise unleash application apigee use ai well google cloud platform enterprise lot application unleashing apigee google apigee well ai order ai need machine learning order machine learning need apps data kind really working enterprise well everybody apigee acquisition little year ago api management done really happy report successful acquisition go well modern development environment developed sort api economy almost machine learning think machine learning use tensorflow build model scratch use auto bunch tool help use auto ml thing automatically generate model could use machine learning apis one job company like fedex use vision api natural language api language translation api video api broad spectrum coming time sort apis apigee apigee great run cloud cloud place provide level direction manage call secure work fit extremely well sort orchestration monitoring environment also mobile development firebase crashlytics android io making trivial write application maybe use bigquery back end kind permanent data store without even know permanent data store tell everybody thing getting like lego put together going developing valuable apps long anyhow apigee part story hook machine learning useful thing think question phone call q heather anne bellini q unidentified participant diane b. greene q heather anne bellini diane b. greene kevin oh sorry kevin light ca see wanted understand traction seeing u.s. bank clearly easy good bank traction home market clearly larger bank second question speak small company one competitor amazon seems really moving quickly quite frequent fast game plan want aggressive across spectrum focus larger company aggressive google want really get oh want company pretty aggressive working really hard bank getting lot traction many area near tell win computing benchmark good good machine learning go fraud detection risk analysis thing bank pretty excited thing think going even good world help bank work even call center natural language processing really biggest hurdle u working bank really getting contracting process really understanding regulator working compliment recently someone said thought actually perhaps best getting stuff done idea least respectable able get contract closed bank first step building thing internationally working bank certainly aws around lot longer u people run seem world people want one provider might helpful talked little bit aws make overture new market change type customer conversation yes great question remember shortly started google got invited guess say invited research board cio know question birthday remember unpleasant question google going compete u mean thought going become insurer thought going everything like going pretty focused nobody worry google q heather anne bellini q unidentified participant diane b. greene q unidentified participant diane b. greene q heather anne bellini q unidentified participantbecause google got really clear everybody looking amazon like got many retailer right away kind going whole industry people seem worried friend little

brainer say ca fight battle migrate gcp thing guy working get place well going everybody going need gcp certainly vision see much much around security modern developer environment machine learning world going moving better worse moving faster faster got get agile development worse getting dangerous standpoint got secure advance machine learning kind revolutionary want take advantage long fulfill think build think good position cost standpoint think advantage captive would longer ... well impossible predict know everybody going price thing know pretty good building eï¬ƒcient data center yes going take last question right give might go would love hear think think gcp would love hear think different bucket sale different product offer like think term basic compute versus machine q heather anne bellini diane b. greene q heather anne bellini diane b. greenelearning like guy internally think different bucket gcp biggest care like sophie choice care bucket right like said extraordinarily complex business infrastructure customer lot volume take good care think provide excellent infrastructure ca go stack ca shaky foundation go stack matter going keep excellence continue moving forward much innovation possible hardware infrastructure pretty exciting system folk really got lot expertise think group working data analytics cloud space think developer environment thinking vertical solution end vertical solution take 3 kind thing kind course everything completely secure take thing kind make tailored horizontal way different industry vertical see great way right going wrap thank diane always appreciate thank
