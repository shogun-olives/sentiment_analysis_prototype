okay yes great first thanks appreciate fun microsoft guess since early 1990s reading glass thing relevant well bit sabbatical amazon.com year microsoft since currently run oﬃce product marketing product management group responsible essentially strategy packaging pricing element bunch different role oﬃce around ran oﬃce client engineering team four year bunch different part business question answer okay since amazon well mentioned spent time inaudible conference last week 40,000 people fit inaudible hotel pretty amazing see cloud team inaudible guy microsoft think whole cloud opportunity kind whole landscape unidentified speaker kirk koenigsbaueryes clearly probably surprised cloud huge inaudible u think microsoft cloud really platform cloud technology common identity term microsoft graph bunch different component course workload like oﬃce 365 like azure like dynamic like project online service center company point term push speaking specifically oﬃce lens really optimistic view future look like term growth opportunity think right feel like phase essentially would call maybe phase 1 journey moving prem base essentially cloud essentially customer fan using technology great certainly minimizing amount hard work go feel like really phase 1 approach think entering phase 2 cloud offer much opportunity grow stock grow arpu going underserved segment segment could go customer even could serve user example emerging market people work desk day pc laptop type worker software worker retail employee travel professional many different kind folk think inaudible even small business capital require reach type user productivity collaboration past expensive complicated cloud mobile world able reach new segment think quite bit opportunity ahead mean think issue legacy voice always inaudible make transition cloud first realize something important kind take right step altered story real success story respect talk little bit journey inaudible start kind elaborate little bit one like start thinking like make kind happen started talk inaudible yes journey really interesting one remember first customer energizer essentially conversation went along line `` hey microsoft think better job running exchange share point frankly want put effort resource differentiating product service sort started thing called bpos business productivity online suite think last quarter announced feel really proud result 85 million active user commercially service 50 million people using mobile apps io android license growth usage growth 40 good think seen lot work kind bunch different dimension mean question start product value recognized early brand trusted brand notion around collaboration productivity thought okay great got also recognized particularly social space hey going really drive hard going invest infrastructure make really enterprise unidentified speaker kirk koenigsbauergrade focused early customer regulator lawmaker really understand take build truly global compliant secure infrastructure think important part differentiation last year company moved cloud every customer talk want talk digital transformation want move trusted partner think benefited u immensely sort humble beginning product think work really really important reboot gtm one thing go sell license customer get deployed partner different service relationship whether retooling sale force whether building partner ecosystem able sell cloud product service cloud product subscription company different sell license sort bit arm reach customer think churn renewal rate think like every single customer channel ltv cac associated eﬃcient way go market really think differently piece guess last big chunk journey really retooling product development process gone day sort long drawn product cycle ship much rapidly product changed build system deployment system literally new role four five year ago eﬃciency agility feedback customer much tight ever thing guess think think journey okay thing like look financial analyst apologize question advance think want bring number think opportunity around oﬃce talk little bit towards number seat mentioned many seat filled already around subscription like total opportunity differentiate commercial consumer little bit okay yes think actually quote specifically oﬃce 365 number provide guidance typically every quarter monthly active user mentioned 85 million grow license 40 well usage growth feel really good come p x q sort question sense talk little bit queue feel continuing inaudible opportunity oﬃce 365 course cloud feel like go also feel like opportunity emerging market opportunity small business opportunity serving customer served worker think big opportunity u expand stock base bullish work inaudible bullish pricing side something really since beginning business productivity online suite first version oﬃce 365 opportunity continue drive mix shift think perspective originally first started feel lot inaudible essentially exchange online unidentified speaker kirk koenigsbauerthat predominant workload people moving sell suite oﬃce 365 plan called e1 certain base level collaboration capability version word excel powerpoint introduced thing called e3 really great mix shift u really recognize lot arpu benefit last 12 24 month would say product includes higher value collaboration side thing like discovery capability one small example archiving also introduced oﬃce client package customer love notion getting oﬃce client per user model one work across platform one always like traditional cloud service turning oﬃce client cloud service big driver arpu growth u new tier introduced year ago call e5 bunch different workload feel like advanced workload continue drive premium mix shift ask number mean premium skews 60 mix right really fantastic see side business well opposed socket expansion think different skews customer sitting like think going like try push everyone e5 going e3 going one way want see customer e5 going like one functionality think inaudible skus yes well course account planning every customer little different really high level general perspective start e1 sort real highly competitive pricing making sure feel good offer marketplace stepping e3 differentiation around oﬃce client advance workload sort super valuable right would say e3 hero sku one lead one always question vision around e5 recently got new advance workload e5 really value proposition three core piece hottest would say one getting amount attention customer right surprisingly security ca conversation talk security whether advance threat protection work thing called customer lockbox discovery bunch really great capability customer super interested another work e5 around analytics power bi sort hero product power bi pro say also product called mind analytics really interesting learning artificial intelligence create personalized productivity dashboard customer third workload around voice voice service literally moving pdx cloud full oriented solution great value proposition customer cost productivity perspective pstn service around pstn conferencing pstn calling service added e5 well feel really good value proposition look like keep pushing upwards customer base unidentified speaker kirk koenigsbauer unidentified speaker kirk koenigsbauer unidentified speakeryes switching gear little bit consumer side like think whole situation yes talked much consumer feel really good consumer business well sense similarly feel like able make transition cloud commercial happening consumer well announced last quarter 24 million active paying subscriber great see notion sort lower cost value sku push called oﬃce 365 personal step customer product called oﬃce 365 home think providing essentially sort family right terabyte storage every single person five family bunch step hearing well feel like transitioning base buying oﬃce pc license subscription business mentioned earlier emerging market big opportunity like think like one hand think like repeat connectivity might good kind oﬃce license sound like actually excited definitely excited sense think similarly happened sort develop market question cost connectivity still expensive emerging market increasingly big city big company expect commercial statement think making term see opportunity lot big company emerging market huge population inaudible two week ago go place like philippine blown away opportunity large population gdp growing quite rapidly 7 think see bunch opportunity customer thinking okay question going move cloud going move cloud well may behind developed market see north america generally speaking lot opportunity quite bullish thing guess would mention related notion customer particularly emerging market think interesting think holistically due hole value proposition question going see opportunity yes okay shifting little bit mentioned earlier artificial intelligence seems like new password every vendor last year talked kirk koenigsbauer unidentified speaker kirk koenigsbauerabout reimagining productivity like think artificial intelligence fit overall scheme reimagining work bet yes big focus u several year think actually credit dr. chivu came microsoft first inaudible also responsible oﬃce business inaudible really pushed company around many many year ago benefited think oﬃce side term insight u think artificial intelligence machine learning around much intelligence feature capability think bunch opportunity whether helping streamline email box cluttered overcrowded use machine learning whether helping literally automate task create content like talked work whether around discovery people content information great inaudible sort vehicle important part value proposition give example launched month back feature powerpoint inaudible powerpoint called powerpoint designer literally take presentation make beautiful like designer lighting box look content template thing like cropping picture inaudible sort blow away sort thing see action wish could come guy really great one word literally revised grammar spelling checking capability using machine learning around natural language literally people like better changing say passive voice active voice inclusive give suggestion better writer people go read stuff read comprehensively excel using artificial intelligence machine learning excel using example sentiment analysis tool actually service wired excel many example way piece machine learning artificial intelligence use security workload well believe reason threat pattern much rapid response able update capability protect customer better many many part life blood oﬃce 365 yes artificial writing probably need extra inaudible talk little bit towards oﬃce oﬃce 365 kind fit kind big area window azure like kind interact two big part inaudible yes increasingly important customer course going heterogeneous environment customer inaudible largely angling towards solution bunch different way example inaudible started discussion inaudible microsoft cloud oﬃce 365 example company go deploys collaboration productivity workload going want unidentified speaker kirk koenigsbauer unidentified speaker kirk koenigsbauerprotect workload inaudible service become natural attachment maybe want crm capability great attach dynamic maybe want project management great attach project online really lot opportunity take socket like oﬃce 365 different workload workload infrastructure perspective building microsoft cloud use azure service product powerpoint designer service referenced actually service run azure mentioned excel example service run azure increasingly able leverage member platform infrastructure data center even window mentioned quite bit work oﬃce window whether ink whether better streamlining notification user experience even security window capability called window event threat protection one exchange online also one part azure take signal together able reason across better protect customer much input coming different service lot opportunity sitting azure obviously like azure global wallet kind global enough inaudible oﬃce already global product azure inaudible help across globe yes think definitely think work closely azure team think overall data center footprint cfo course quite involved discussion well might expect definitely think significant competitive advantage u mean take oﬃce 365 right 150 market worldwide next year another 97 market localized 44 different language introduced microsoft team early november new collaboration sort workspace oﬃce 365 immediately available preview right immediately available million million customer evaluation trial able experience definitely think great share opportunity microsoft cloud okay perfect know three minute ca let go without talking profitability margin gross margin look scale oﬃce like big saas company already gross margin seemed yield little bit lower guy space talk little bit factor need consider think profitability gross margin yes sure productivity collaboration space inaudible saas workload going point solution unidentified speaker kirk koenigsbauerthe marketplace solution maybe heavy storage component going obviously lower margin suite like offering breadth service think little bit tricky compare would say productivity collaboration space expect think actually relatively well announced good quarter growth margin improvement overall microsoft expect continue oﬃce talked little bit arpu opportunity continue improve margin think opportunity sure also think opportunity run business notion eﬃcient thing like combine consumer email service course based hotmail originally exchange online service inaudible one service one way bringing together much eﬃcient improve margin data center capability go globally grow global capital eﬃciency get driving 85 million user oﬃce help margin overall expect continue see growth think little bit lumpy generally speaking expect expect improve time go one level opex like remember amy started kind least introduced notion like 100 budget year spend next get 105 seems lot dynamic talk little bit impacting working oﬃce space yes sure question amy satya think really taken much company term changing culture one area culture absolutely changed think really positive way much agile think budgeting managing opex amy think great job pushing u say agile mean lot ﬂexibility real big push reallocate opposed always asking give example lot example digital market ever done highly eﬃcient u particularly small business consumer space also enterprise degree literally probably running 10 13 campaign month look look ltv look cac see saturation look like every month sort shifting dollar around go invest think going deliver highest value stock budget cycle think done incredible job setting great culture around reallocation eﬃciency discipline always
