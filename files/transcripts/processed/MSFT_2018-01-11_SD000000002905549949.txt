okay think going go ahead kick thank everybody coming tycho peterson life science team jpmorgan today interesting panel chad robin adaptive biotechnology one founder peter lee microsoft question answer think kick maybe ask give little bit introduction maybe chad talk little bit adaptive role company play sequencing immune system important sure tycho thank u appreciate adaptive characterizes cell adaptive immune system precise exquisite level attacker cell pathogen come body defender cell immune system primary defender cell cell b cell job bind kill remember foreign perturbation come body unique immune system cell dna actually rearranges able able use sequencing technology characterize read dna exquisite level goal vision adaptive translate precision scale immune system diagnose treat disease first commercial product blood cancer called clonoseq measuring minimal residual disease able predict relapse whether cancer gone treatment pipeline diagnostics related concept whether immune system competent peter lee q tycho w. peterson peter lee chad m. robinsnot save discussion partnership antigen mab peter introduction great let add thanks really great thrilled great partnership adaptive biotechnology peter lee corporate vice president microsoft run organization created satya nadella harry shum shortly satya took ceo internally called next organization deep tie reach microsoft research viewed kind internal venture fund supposed spark new project empower team disciplined investment process grow new product engineering team new line business microsoft essentially mission focus area traditionally silicon future particularly silicon strategy technology data center cloud also ai machine learning long ago satya nadella asked u take health care strategy microsoft hunt smallest set partner really go deep research development really make difference world bring new product business idea fore adaptive biotechnology really much top mind incredibly thrilling important partnership u want talk little bit partnership came obviously based seattle maybe history led adaptive search want start sure sure get started say vision adaptive spun fred hutchinson cancer research center 2009 founded company brother harlan robin vision could use immune system diagnose disease perhaps universal diagnostic many many year although took u probably close decade develop chemistry technology informatics led u believe possible course last two year put final piece together explain detail minute link immune receptor pathogen bind getting functionality immune system receptor led u say hey start filling map entire human adaptive immune system call immunome start filling chemistry realized would take sophisticated machine learning cloud compute power truly get problem able impact patient care set started talking variety different partner big data large market cap machine learning expert think assumption went discussion change based partner peter lee q tycho w. petersonthat wound talking microsoft deep commitment really putting resource talking financial resource term investment talking resource commitment fte perspective capability team incredible synergy member team level starting peter happen season ticket couple seat away seahawks scientist level technology level even board level connection point kind massive commitment say right long term want make cornerstone peter convinced many discussion executive leadership team team microsoft going cornerstone microsoft genomics effort could differentiate strategy based going tractable problem differentiating around immunomics sequencing adaptive immune system deal work several month think could echo peter comment could trilled microsoft partner yes got lot done halftime seahawks game think perspective microsoft reason world health care huge vast ocean fact joked satya nadella asked u take felt like threw u middle pacific ocean ask u find land mean go quickly microsoft quickly start focus well cloud ai matter start take discussion possible precision medicine future fundamental technology quickly get genomics space omics space course big player already fully kind rationalize reason space started ask question well could really kind go deep really gain confidence space got u discussion one thing rose top interesting scientific commercial work going generally speaking around immune system actually microsoft research interaction harlan robin scientist adaptive biotechnology fred hutch relationship fred hutch gave u insight one thing led another consistently led adaptive biotechnology leader space started interact arrived incredibly beautiful perspective incredibly beautiful scary big incredibly beautiful machine learning problem really directed focused way lot engineering finance engineering excellence could really solve important problem really went left chad get creative deal structure chad mentioned took month got done maybe let look ahead little bit think vision collaboration think ultimately could mean patient end day chad m. robin peter lee let give vision let back tangible milestone think important separate 2 term vision based blood test based understanding immune receptor antigen binding diagnose multiple disease one time think think immune system project immune system molecular stethoscope get eventually currently agency fda payer community work shorter term want break going call fruit unmet medical need disease extremely hard diagnose either slow invasive done test let take multiple sclerosis 50 test determine settling disease diagnosis test know molecular level immune receptor combination immune receptor immune receptor specific antigen bind antigen specific disease know potentially diagnose disease think area auto immune disease certain chronic pathogen perhaps using example coming prioritization matrix disease state want diagnose first think thing like lyme disease even cancer space look population would narrow would say hey let go general screen first would say let target plus woman ovarian cancer whereas diagnosis stage 4 fatal able diagnose earlier stage kind massive patient benefit yes really kind think also think though look screen biological system mri initially indicated screen system indicated specific use believe look forward working partner microsoft working agency working payer community education kind time layer diagnostic diagnostic diagnostic ultimately get screen entire system actually leave got couple comment ... well maybe add question partnership work 2 least 2 component important one one working together develop technology advance science develop technology part business arrangement 2 important thing put lot thought technology side roughly speaking think 3 component one data ideally label training data super ideally hell lot really important extremely impressive adaptive biotechnology large amount labeled unlabeled data also ability really high throughput way generate labeled data super important second algorithm machine learning something proud capability contribution go half silicon valley startup trying kind imaging large running resnet 50 came directly lab much much sophistication cloud q tycho w. peterson chad m. robin q tycho w. peterson chad m. robin peter leescale bring bear ideally put 2 thing together get model machine learning model give basic ai intelligence almost perfect working relationship data algorithm turning model diagnostic tool technology go back adaptive biotechnology think nice comfortable clean setup business side trying everything keep clear simple respect intellectual property respect respect adaptive future business prospect success try keep thing clean clear liberates engineering development team unencumbered complication focus get work done think one advantage think assay technology ability look retrospective data set something leverage partnership absolutely one thing designed assay able characterize retrospective sample think huge advantage u develop training set data scale quickly technical term look sample stored especially cancer setting formalin fixation ffpe sample assay work ffpe need fresh sample use dna analyte many many different reason move rapidly develop really massive quantity data peter team apply machine learning algorithm hopefully get u answer quicker think time line think maybe initial milestone ultimately commercialization around initial disease state far couple year look first set diagnostics kind 3 four year time line think concept universal diagnostic working agency payer community probably decade think one comment microsoft really great partner u commitment shipping product already commercialized first diagnostic diagnostics pipeline related immune competence keen mega moonshot say hey maybe 10 year later going something believe tractable problem make significant headway several disease diagnostics short term short term 3 time horizon term shipping product may 2 comment make one scale machine learning problem talking literally web q tycho w. peterson chad m. robin peter leescale fairly daunting prospect unknown u team done huge amount machine learning foundational work actually present bing search engine example confident ability also cognizant fact get level scale start first day addressing ensuring level kind engineering precision excellence ca bolt later term innovation process speaking purely manager nice thing guarantee first day thinking term product shipping quality super important thing say remember microsoft part cloud ai imperative also part trying think role broadly genomics space sort activity really give u also broader kind reason exploring thing led u partnership investment also entered agreement g nexus example including investment already see partnership also lead kind sparking innovative idea way almost perfect u think organization sort moonshot universal blood test super inspiring attracts talent like crazy time see prospect steady stream intermediate product coming pipe time career situation combination quite like maybe could touch regulatory reimbursement side thing alluded earlier evolving landscape panel earlier week dual pathway seen foundation exact go successfully curious start think payer engagement think regulatory side thing sure ca start either regulatory payer engagement early enough say say diagnostics industry challenging fact universal payer coverage got government payer coverage medicare medicaid go kind one one private payer side tech assessment body et cetera complex web navigate said encouraged think pathway sequencing natural coverage decision referring medicare really mentality around fda thinking problem last year kind new scott gottlieb helm incredibly think impressive also seeing payer side well willingness engage dialogue earlier previously take lot concept think 2 component challenging concept one alluded earlier kind screen biological system molecular level challenging concept also think end day immune system beautiful system able think think early engagement encouraged counting guy chad m. robin q tycho w. peterson chad m. robin peter lee q tycho w. peterson lot challenge think kind practical implication patient perspective data interpretation treatment paradigm ultimately look like patient getting diagnosed earlier think side early diagnosis potentially may established treatment paradigm area yes think great question guess simply put going information think certain disease state disease state clear unmet medical need clear kind translation information actionability clearly diagnose certain cancer earlier take information cut tumor start treatment earlier think clearly certain autoimmune disorder information earlier could get right treatment go concept precision personalized medicine say let get right treatment right patient right time certain area fraught kind political consideration question frankly think perhaps stay away first information sake worrying people sure place start unless treatment something think start area first kind clear clinical utility clear actionability thing develop new medicine develop talk layering additional diagnostics yes little bit tangent actually one conversation chad several time pertains research development program thing going target first rationale talk machine learning folk certain criterion certain way thinking thing come biology side also third component business side need creative inventive cognizant regulatory landscape sort want framework taking account 3 thing order frame decision process target priority order focus team way ongoing discussion think going give u lot insight one thing also conference like one sure much even get earful stakeholder suggestion thought targeting thing early sort input think interesting time trying decide basically priority list peter lee q tycho w. peterson chad m. robinscan talk little bit type data going collecting think also collecting phenotypic data outcome data think data side right already interesting data set adaptive access term antigen term blood bank sample blood bank sample correlated specific disease state technology take naive sample inoculate way generate remarkably high rate new label data set think thing combination labeled unlabeled training data corpus one thing instructed assume much knowledge machine learning put simply machine learning way conceiving deep learning paradigm 2 phase training phase inference execution phase data asset adaptive able create give u gold mine first training phase able even unlabeled data set start automated feature extraction large scale informative drive accuracy inference whatever diagnostic application come kind data privilege hand important whole program least machine learning side one thing wanted say culture agility microsoft get lot partnership grand plan extract insight data probably many organization represented room also generally speaking decision made go thing get frustration delay overcome technological regulatory strategic hurdle actually get data hand data scientist machine learning researcher thing found exciting literally within 2 hour signing partnership agreement adaptive significant data set hand machine learning researcher think within 2 hour pretty deep question back adaptive level agility reinforce reality significant data asset work patient consent perspective mean need patient kind opt development path panel yesterday 23andme talked high level patient engagement kind gone path drug development level consent payer patient process well 2 different stage data development generation first term actually buy massive leukopaks basically drain people blood create huge pool naive receptor transfect challenge different antigen presentation basically disease pathogen bind use sophisticated suite technology start filling map need patient consent secondly ... peter lee chad m. robin q tycho w. peterson chad m. robin q tycho w. peterson way let interrupt want say one thing first u u learning language lingo one thing never get comfortable hope lingo draining someone blood wanted get straight toggle buy although many experiment early day secondly going sequence disease state example one data set targeting woman health initiative 30 year data clinical data associated underlying molecular data set patient consent many many case patient consent already done u said clearly area general counsel legal make sure kind right consent anything prospectively absolutely make sure patient consent able work therapeutic angle potentially around discovery leveraged drug development partner ... absolutely hope think first step pharma biotech company better understand therapy impacting patient think actually good time mention think relates timing question important note already developed delivery mechanism able perform test really 2 component one creating massive map cross attacker cell defender cell cell receptor antigen like huge vlookup table excel second component patient walk doctor oﬃce get blood drawn sequenced already developed perfected course eight year bulletproof technology sequence patient immune receptor idea map receptor massive data table knowing receptor 2 18 9 billion correspond specific say let take lyme disease think give u kind head start say hey theoretical exercise map created truly matter leveraging core technology tycho question think answered go back risk diagnosis labeling healthy individual patient due false positive think aspect situation immune system naturally correct necessarily need intervention think process chad m. robin peter lee q tycho w. peterson chad m. robin yes lot discussion better question harlan engage think first lot work right think lot dogma field happens incorrect think immune let take immune system property begin maybe kind back question immune system actually best natural diagnostic right job take small perturbation amplify signal okay aspect highly specific highly accurate highly systemic able pick localized reaction able pick blood question whether different type immune system cell go different stage term immune cascade question whether immune reaction picking early leading incorrect treatment decision think jury still whether immune system actually level able pick believe already done job actually disease really computer science perspective really interesting question one thing mostly anxious learn one thing deep neural net turn actually get black white answer yes answer get confidence level signal strength codified term neural activation deep neural net structure case get yes 100 lyme disease get 97 confidence lyme disease also possible get conﬂicting signal thing exactly common information taken diagnostic regime think actually one interesting aspect one steady thing realize machine learning model little bit like living entity data feed clarity ultimate signal get also evolving point way another element think exciting thinking sort deeply embedded artificial intelligence tool entering regime kind accuracy precision answer given tool evolves ideally improves time ultimately see immune screening technology universal panel side settling primary preventative screen something patient selection clinical trial mean see ultimately use case universal test think matter time horizon breaking kind tangible milestone time think goal would checkup doctor oﬃce every time go blood drawn would immune system sequenced think way tycho immune system know disease doctor peter lee chad m. robin peter lee q tycho w. peterson peter lee q tycho w. petersondoes talked field talked cancer immunotherapy term harnessing power immune system kind fight cancer really immunodiagnostic really harnessing power immune system diagnose disease able tell doctor see going longer term kind shorter term start kind layering disease diagnostics think kind specific different disease state hard diagnose autoimmune disorder chronic pathogen cancer patient et cetera matter letting data extremely company powered machine learning data partner truly matter letting data drive tell u actually capable sure love concept blood test everyone take every year talk way clearly drive cloud consumption think simple u also going good patient indeed pater maybe talk little bit tool microsoft disposal developed brought partnership right mentioned well big part team internal investment silicon innovation silicon strategy might familiar fact microsoft fact cloud business rapidly evolving silicon computing fabric cloud entering refer era silicon scaling hitting certain limit infrastructure looking ahead future likely become important kind workload contemplating customized asics reconfigurable computing fabric thing embedded network infrastructure cloud global data center thing think going end meet amount success approaching scale thing important already see within microsoft example bing search engine use bing north america may notice web search result ranked entirely network data center computing core data center blade happens whole host technical reason driven scale really contemplating scale adaptive chad m. robin peter leeas think way partnership structured room expand time think partnership evolving inaudible disease area absolutely mean think first foremost structure partnership microsoft allowed u keep asset together making investment parent company top providing resource commitment term people expertise think important second look size problem dollar going take able truly solve partially funded depending result see let speak term kind additional road interest kind moving forward greater scale absolutely really looking partnership look assessment criterion one reason chose microsoft partner orientation around actually know true cost going take sequence entire immune system start filling puzzle make significant headway issue actually asked earlier able use technology retrospective sample able fraction cost technology strategy going early detection example talking low hundred million dollar opposed billion dollar meaningful term cost perspective also term timing perspective way dovetail question kind false positive issue bringing start looking one reason look example looking peripheral mutation look cancer genomics run kind prospective clinical trial part relation type sample type technology work problem whereas really trying catch disease earliest state tumor shed enough stuff peripheral mutation able pick truly looking needle haystack problem said really hope company solve great patient population also want say technology potentially complementary right looking genomics cancer versus host response body responding cancer bringing case cancer think scale effort underway cancer mentioned throughout discussion today think important note getting immune system business perspective patient perspective think one largest addressable kind opportunity cut across autoimmune disorder infectious disease cancer even kind neurological disorder depression allergy thing may might may think remediated mounting evidence across large body publication show many disorder remediated think let data drive really interesting problem q tycho w. peterson peter lee q tycho w. peterson q unidentified participant chad m. robinswhat tend tell people cost something like real ai system infinity reason fundamentally learning system let take simple example let take microsoft translator language translation never done infinite amount engineering always improve quality say english russian russian chinese always integrate data always improve algorithm fact model real question much much cost done point start able recoup investment get ahead sort ai regime really fundamental question need need kind analytical throttle element investment order ensure glide path point able get ahead ongoing cost march towards intelligence guess think output venture may certainly kit panel assay guess microsoft perspective software opportunity think interpretation either part physician reference lab yes think first pure computer science perspective beautiful thing machine learning algorithm generally broad application obviously blinker focused specific problem adaptive brought u recognize lot experience algorithm likely much broader application train always open minded possibility arrangement intellectual property portfolio adaptive remains complete clean still give u opportunity look new application really important element look microsoft relevant become competent broadly genomics space great partner give u chance get competent give u chance learn learn good lot faith become good open opportunity invest yet broader set area genomics space think open question audience one microphone okay part question answered last dialogue first question thought looking biomarker well start giving drug diagnosed cancer keep looking cell receptor see going q unidentified participant chad m. robin q unidentified participant chad m. robin peter lee q tycho w. petersonabsolutely matter fact today part battery assay sorry test around concept immune competence partnered 85 biotech pharma company many around space autoimmune disorder space et cetera one thing looking specifically look different level drug impact clonality really immune system provide informative information patient treated technology developed last couple year bind receptor antigen really starting understand characterize functionality receptor back earlier question kind know diagnosis binding potentially use immune receptor therapeutically obviously space started cellular therapy within oncology cancer car space effort underway using naturally occurring tcrs try move field working blood cancer working solid tumor think quite bit hope information amount data collecting work pharma chance able help pharma company better understand drug impacting patient ultimately clinician change treatment decision based immune system information able hopefully able use immune receptor therapeutic context well one question could even ... like back school like 27 part well one thing might want look think huge need neuromuscular space hard find biomarkers good enough reason believe lot neuromuscular disease immune component cell component actually specific cell imagining specific cell receptor diagnosis tough also biomarker people able run clinical trial biomarkers find one exciting space look huge need thank great anyone else q unidentified participant chad m. robin peter lee chad m. robin q tycho w. peterson peter lee chad m. robinsdoes partnership cover nascent drug development work option currently contemplated partnership think something like actually reason hanging every leader within microsoft probably approach little bit differently important trying drive innovation process get early win quickly dictate level focus would think would least side push pretty hard start really understand able work well together lot agility might feel freer kind expand space collaborative possibility something dictate typically situation guess go another seahawks game figure way hash sort kind push pull something appreciated partnership specifically chad kind easy level transparency kind sharing philosophy concern get u excited good absolutely question audience okay conclude want thank taking time today congrats partnership thank much thank appreciate
