manufacturer talked virtual cockpit automotive space removing dial removing button one single dashboard leveraged using nvidia technology behind area key focus well auto well center compute ph let see turn back key question may regarding one four market question answer yes perfect colette maybe kick thing mics people question audience guess one question get asked often datacenter mentioned supercomputing 2015 talked 100 top 500 computer supercomputer acceleration 70 market share kind curious though think acceleration application migrating supercomputer market cloud market specifically revenue today datacenter actually customer see sort tam evolving next call 1 3 five year q unidentified participant colette kressyes overall datacenter business probably two three year ago primarily hpc computing area still growing continues grow even today new supercomputer emergence acceleration supercomputer continues grow lot continued growth today see next couple year continue come arena think long term believe acceleration datacenter everywhere nothing probably stop possibility acceleration almost every single server term datacenter work researcher also web service provider designing datacenters need really allowed u produce pipeline produce result strong relationship key isps around world many focused west coast u ranging far term asia pacific european area well see importance acceleration seen early sign moore law probably slow datacenter going slow looking need acceleration producing product really really tailored toward get workload complete thinking acceleration application market still early think one question get asked often trying figure acceleration application think done gpu versus fpga time yes think good question contemplate one actually done key understand different way course acceleration key benefit key difference many different form acceleration gpu form acceleration one ease ph ability programmability programmable hardware level programmable software capability designed computing programming capability cuda enables program something similar c++ something relatively common well something also continued branch many different training center around world best integratives coming research institution higher education trained cuda programming gpu make easier software level continuing revise algorithm continuing revise overall programming match overall application hardware easier form factor q unidentified participant colette kress q unidentified participant colette kressadditionally gpu tremendous performance multiplication factor acceleration factor gpu enables bar none type acceleration continue see demand performance programmability key reason gpu continues take leadership position lot acceleration think colette think intel footprint datacenter today even admission bring altera house going integrated chip cpu fpga integrated package first think competing market intel talk big talk around optimizing cpu fpga ultimately bringing onto piece silicon answer question maybe talk little bit effort power effort arm ph well yes reference speak year ago last fall supercomputer future u department energy two top supercomputer going forward designed architecture ibm power server well nvidia gpu well nvidia nvlink overall buff cpu gpu important sign key architecture supercomputer going
