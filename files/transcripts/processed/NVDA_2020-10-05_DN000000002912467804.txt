see example like always free community version one policy community version free developer version could free always free version company want make sure hook want make sure kind enterprise agreement enterprise business model allows get front open source allows get front developer others get software hand towards software debug let see touch based second question regarding overall ampere demand impact term gross margin far gaming demand rtx 30 series chart expected really great holiday season knew overall platform bring best generation generation performance ever got great release fall game coming work home even bringing gaming entertainment social arena racing catch demand ramp going well yield good intact think gross margin remind term gross margin outlook q3 outlook q3 usual quarter mix driver overall gross margin expect strong sequential increase q john pitzer jensen huang operator q mark lipacis jensen huangfor gaming gaming piece business strong took slight sequential dip term guidance gross margin everything seems place intact change term gross margin term seeing helpful thanks guy thank next question come mark lipacis jefferies line open hi thanks presentation today question think one jensen provide integrated data center scale architecture trying make sure understand far across data center value chain deep value chain nvidia feel nvidia go order deliver think pretty clear nvidia chip company platform company maybe could compare feel need deliver across value chain today today data center value chain nvidia effectively becoming equivalent company selling processor data center today company selling server software networking company software o application side far software stack going could provide maybe analogue today data center versus data center scale architecture delivering future maybe would helpful level set thank sure first first three question hit right away explain one like company exist today ai problem opportunity challenge opportunity unlike software ever written otherwise could thing right number one number two integrated data center number three innovate much need much need little innovate much need little guiding principle nvidia little trying everything trying thing thing world relies u thing world absolutely case today world absolutely case gelsinger worked vmware partnership u two u get done wo get done go thing world answered three question quickly let give back little bit explain one way ai written way ai software computer learning data learning data collect asked coach inï¬‚uence type neural network architecture type data presented way wanted learn coach like coach like teacher go know run day week junk ph amount data writes software done writing software made ca read unreadable like neural like brain dump somebody brain readable requires new type computer run way software written methodology written infrastructure pressure creates pod ph technical diï¬ƒculty talking four speaker fantastic today really appreciate work could hear phrase tip iceberg challenge computing solving software different way written different pool ph different pressure infrastructure different coordinate different time history see albus 1 ph data center enterprise data center advance hybrid cloud enterprise data center manage three computing environment never happened one computing environment bare metal inaudible computing like supercomputer number two virtualized virtualized easily manageable easily scalable easily secured third continuized micro service core far edge never visit drop server connect network hopefully never go back warehouse never go back store room ever manage one thin glass far away three type computing domain never happened one company got go make happen never done ai never done gpus go create necessary gpu done creating done creating important done creating open like sdk open like sdks system sdks adp ph egx agx sdk hardware component oems integrate put top entire software sdk put library top application developer create tool like application framework basically ai skill stuff put cloud q mark lipacis jensen huang operator q matt ramsay jensen huangall stuff put cloud certified optimized run data center run cloud result connect network partner software developer system maker solution maker cloud service provider want partner world run ai run nvidia already computing run nvidia clara run nvidia rapid run nvidia isaac jarvis mervin sdks created hope helpful know look different however accelerated computing need look different moore law finished number two ai different written human written machine world changed new type company need created helpful thank right thanks lot next question come matt ramsay cowen line open yes thank much good afternoon good morning jensen couple question first one noticed bluefield dpu roadmap eventually guy integrate sort full ai engine dpu wondered could talk little bit acceleration side ai opportunity fruit might available particularly security domain second question ai acceleration dpu acceleration integrated stack mean whether buy arm buy arm seems like could make cpu maybe could talk little bit pro con going one piece tam addressing today thanks yeah excellent question number one give example intrusion detection intrusion detection distributed perimeter data center protected every single transaction every single node every single application protected door reason forget intruder largely inside building already future also public cloud entire data center opened world ca allowed intrusion moment intruder go inside data center go sideways data center imagine damage could security incredible every single node become super firewall firewall technology today intrusion detection technology today based ai got put ai processing right network number one number two network shaping network traï¬ƒc shaping ai problem optimization problem done simple set equation heuristic problem dynamic problem one computer science problem go well depends solution well depends well depends requires intelligence want put intelligence right network computer science described past network computing two example computing okay big deal super excited one reason one reason go back early day talked acquisition mellanox talked normal computing talked network become fabric lot computational lot ai first step several thing ca many thing arm many thing arm arm build cpu however never another cpu built like arm ever computer science problem anymore started computer science problem 30 year ago architecture designed like visionary reason energy eï¬ƒcient world hit wall end moore law got runway runway arm x86 mean bottom line architecture energy eï¬ƒcient therefore got runway however moore law end well need bring accelerated computing arm arm number one genius architecture also genius business model reason wanted arm popular cpu world want used kind thing everything everything car phone television name required business model allow license ip soft form soft ï¬‚exible form fit people chip many computer future full whole data center one chip whole computer one chip phone one chip tv one chip thing two chip one chip second thing business model created third thing ultimately valuable thing today vast ecosystem execution machine arm know build soft ip ip smartphones embedded system microcontrollers data center increasingly pc number cpu core engine behind creates soft ip productizing delivering customer helping integrated chip phenomenal phenomenal result created ecosystem thousand chip company ship 22 billion operator q harlan sur kimberly powellchips last year nvidia shipped 0.1 billion difference nvidia arm 22 billion put perspective reach ecosystem value u ca building another cpu matter another cpu care think ecosystem ever rich one 30 year build took enormous character enormous vision built team built phenomenal love cambridge work cambridge great computer science team love work done ultimately asset buying combination ecosystem built simply wo get replicated next question come harlan sur jpmorgan line open good morning thank taking question one powerful dynamic team creating leveraging entire portfolio target vertical market question kimberly vertical market focus like healthcare drug discovery opportunity talked primarily focused high performance computing platform like egx moving across portfolio team leveraging edge inferencing portfolio like egx jetson product family within healthcare franchise involved team hoping define next generation hardware system platform yeah thanks harlan thanks question drug discovery right dgx system full stack architecture literally cross every computer science domain yes heavy upcoming artificial intelligence course take advantage accelerated computing also going instrumental data science machine learning data analytics move gigantic data set genomic data set even compound screening generate huge output analysis need analytics really call necessary information literally leverage every corner nvidia extreme powerful computing architecture whether accelerated computing data science machine learning deep learning natural language processing area justin touched brieï¬‚y decade working edge device frankly revolutionizing medical instrument care u see inside body extract dna build 3 billion letter make u instrument one edge platform future like phone car want software defined sensor technology created edge medical instrument incredibly powerful continue get amazing insight new information sensor technology applying artificial intelligence ca remind old way deploying instrument would sell couple million dollar q harlan sur operator q raji gillct scanner would refresh every 10 sometimes 15 year ca carry way anymore edge computing absolutely going vital going software defined future medical instrument imagine new instrument leverage everything built jetson platform also leverage building egx platform able remotely manage provision securely operate edge node need updated new ai application time extremely vital example justin gave northwestern hospital actually plenty sensor already exist healthcare environment microphone camera coupled artificial intelligence conversational ai brand new service enter healthcare hospital environment like would expect like home talk smart speaker unlocking enabling environment health care system today using deepstream used smart city jarvis used lot conversational ai platform leverage technology create domain specific application

new instrument augmenting existing instrument compute coupling amazing sensor live health care environment ai able manage securely deploy application egx future incredibly bright see smart hospital application popping literally woodwork course imagine respond great demand dynamic putting healthcare system cool thanks kimberly next question come raji gill needham company line open yes thank thanks excellent presentation thinking new cloud class data center product dpu think kind pricing dynamic term revenue opportunity relative class chip selling trying understand kind integrated share jensen huang q raji gill jensen huang operator q ambrish srivastava jensen huang yeah two pillar could could look towards one course baseline smart nic go hundred dollar modest cpu oï¬ „ oad provide application performance server get boost effectively going add dpu server expectation time double performance server kind put value somewhat two spacing ph work go thank yeah thanks lot next question come ambrish srivastava bmo line open hi thank much jensen question inferencing one gaming well maybe colette could answer inferencing shared pretty revealing piece data term crossing cpu gave projection 90 market share intel incumbent could please help u understand kind term much training could translate nvidia inferencing give confidence get 90 share also assuming competition market know jensen know competition lately gaming side colette know past event guy kind giving u component cagr term unit asp wondering could help u well also said gaming sorry asking multipart question said fastest ramp ever could give little bit detail helpful thank yeah yeah actually share compute aggregate compute cloud example pc right pc decent gpu ph aggregate computational throughput pc 99 gpu fact aggregate dpu versus gpu compute inside data center inside supercomputer high performance computer 99 gpu reason job primary job data acceleration primary job compute colette kressand say cpu useful job job manage application manage operating system manage orchestrate processing application figuring get priority thing really important moving thing around managing thing really important single threaded performance single threaded application code operating process single threaded part code becomes critical path otherwise known amdahl law vast majority cloud going forward accelerated fact program conclusion point corollary moore law ended therefore look another approach accelerate application moore law ended yet hand emergence new type application called ai require much computation exactly time cpu performance going double every couple year ca wait world look code take advantage acceleration happened perfectly good time reason cloud compute cloud computing world factor application disaggregate disaggregated whenever disaggregate containerized certain module certain micro service might well must infusing ai anyway think conï¬‚uence end moore law beginning ai emergence new type data center data center scale computing call working favor colette yeah let see answer question regarding split gaming asp growth unit growth important overall growth period time contributed one key thing note term inï¬‚uencing unit asp growth onset laptop notebook gaming gaming notebook market really grown quite well great asp force well continue uplift overall asp new gamers coming board tend take rtx tend take higher performing overall gpu start still provide slew different overall price point attract every single gamer see asp probably period reaching growth still great opportunity go forward also announced right overall ampere architecture gaming growing quite well launch probably best launch history opportunity little bit different overall terrain terrain opportunity u address ray tracing first time really start market essentially chicken egg type market hardware availability began beginning overall software q ambrish srivastava operator jensen huang operatorwe also take little bit pause term launch really address whole scope gpus longer period time excited term performance improvement overall ampere well great price point far launch ramp growing quite well really pleased term thing going okay thank detail thank bring u end today session turn call back jensen closing remark amazing time computer industry world age ai begun nvidia full throttle
