company outside company genuine positive trend company maybe dig cloud service productivity side versus platform side talk investor device service strategy think investor positive view cloud service use abundance inaudible cloud service although perhaps pessimistic view prospect device side particularly mobile critical microsoft play mobile mobile operating system versus leveraging qi lu keith wei qi lusome platform already existing cloud service keith good question believe actually speak particular topic even last year couple dimension share thought one belief industry phase phase whereby vertical integration meaning innovation across boundary hardware software operating system application service unlock lot value economic value many many example inaudible microsoft also point company driving integration across boundary see opportunity microsoft main principle window operating system device driving innovation using service give one example see people using surface pro 3 one example want best inking experience inaudible want ink annotate capture surface pro 3 across board far best experience one many many example thinking driving innovation remain strong principle using building mobile device building mobile business time also important point also making service available mobile platform particularly group investing substantial engineering resource product energy deliver leading productivity expense o android example o device mobile downloads already exceeds 80 million user downloads number keep growing recently announced oï¬ƒce android tablet available believe january internally quite bit investing r resource keep pace innovation deliver leading productivity service across different mobile platform time inside microsoft driving innovation best complete experience microsoft operating system microsoft party device got maybe shifting gear little bit drill oï¬ƒce 365 talk u oï¬ƒce 365 tracking relative guy internal expectation enterprise side consumer side equation want drill little bit enterprise term driving oï¬ƒce 365 growth relative expectation see positive trend commercial side focus keith driving adoption consumption game cloud different le selling license getting customer migrate quickly drive keith weissusages consumption specific focus product r side making adoption permanent part overall experience past sold product used experience experience think future barrier exist one holistic experience end user adopts oï¬ƒce 365 consumption adoption experience built lot focus driving usage adoption consumer side also need thing time driving mobile experience product innovation drive usage adoption product innovation cutting u across commercial side consumer side one sway ph sway new operating product operating service essentially new inaudible file format per se life cloud fantastic experience mobile app also web experience well enables author document using simple capability use camera use ink use voice use sort medium beauty author render appropriate whether phone tablet large screen layout engine automatically figure best way showcase document one key innovation tried another innovation mentioned last year keith believe talked new product called adell ph built new infrastructure called oï¬ƒce graph think oï¬ƒce graph first version inaudible working environment whereby graph representation people document message work activity event thing connected adell product first time document people usage get connected discover document different people using example inaudible lot people browse cluster essentially document reviewing trending document people sending confidentiality thing taking care people see kind document looking inaudible huge past know going trending important different team type innovation really driving adoption inside commercial product also across consumer product well consumer oï¬ƒce 365 pricing oï¬ƒce 365 pretty evident microsoft garner value lifetime value product 100 per year versus average person buying 250 every five year little le clear enterprise see really good adoption term cio looking adopt oï¬ƒce 365 recent cio survey showed 26 cio using oï¬ƒce 365 today another 26 expecting use next two year great adoption trend talk little bit microsoft plan increase lifetime value customer term oï¬ƒce 365 subscriber versus licensed tied enterprise agreement qi lu yes keith one key question product innovation certainly value creation standpoint couple thing emphasize one service moving service cloud would increase lifetime value severalfold fundamental reason one inaudible service immediately see customer interaction pace innovation different past deploy new version software adoption always long tail typically new version 25 individual adopt new version lot customer stay older version get benefit new feature cloud service immediately get benefit new feature value increasing value increasing number one number two interactivity enables u build digital model mentioned earlier using digital representation people document message event work activity build graph graph give u intelligence service feature generate would productivity user drive pace innovation deliver value customer think fundamental one fundamental trend delivering value driving innovation end user productivity get lifted number one number two adjacent area mental model past three decade ph today productivity large using pc endpoint device using file folder document main form delivering productivity moving cloud end point computing edge moving mobile device delivery cover different people therefore envelope productivity expand today productivity service 1.1 billion user believe reach 2 billion professional three year new generation productivity experience available mobile device reach larger customer base enable u expand another area value growth area value growth natural adjacency course couple thing one focusing adding service compliance security thing move cloud lot lot value protecting data critical enterprise important particularly inaudible nsa area lot concern moving data cloud moving service cloud protect beefing product offering enables u add create value growth initiative said inside microsoft also inaudible opportunity example last quarter reached inaudible mobile enterprise mobility service em product one many example use oï¬ƒce 365 integrate microsoft service create value combination inaudible think driving value productivity end user keith wei qi lu look natural adjacency look boundary synergy opportunity inside microsoft overall collectively grow enterprise value focusing innovation using oï¬ƒce 365 got maybe stepping one adjacency newly renamed cipher ph business one fastest area fast area guy talk u resonating customer within cipher business offering using today expand next couple year cipher consumer play great question way think think cipher business represents huge growth opportunity today keith already dollar business leading scenario enterprise customer see ton ton opportunity remove pressure create value large today meeting expense full friction based survey average meeting take 14 minute get started sort issue people calling connection good sometimes people forgot mute keep talking remind please unmute turn lot opportunity really use technology innovation remove friction one aspect second aspect building tiered technological foundation shared infrastructure time future communication particularly conference communication become smart sense today let say phone call video call talk planning trip la vega software know going la vega give recommendation order future envision future communication become smart building full stack communication going understood talked providing additional service additional tool made conversation lot intelligent easier use see fantastic opportunity lift quality experience full productivity meeting scenario furtherly aï¬ƒnity skype business skype building unified stack future skype skype business become uniform essentially coherent set experience consumer enterprise customer today already supporting interop skype user skype business user interop future experience important see future trend individual going separate thing thing use work thing use life going use service really work opportunity u use leverage skype brand global user base skype huge global user base also large mobile presence skype product called groupme keith wei qi luone popular product united state college student merging two uniform product offering single technology stack consistently experience believe fantastic new opportunity drive lot growth case platform business take two answer together term getting higher lifetime value customer without moving adjacency sound like going bundling larger deal customer bundling service trying sell customer productivity application standpoint time bundle going toward subscription day offering wrong think time whole group going become 100 subscription revenue term offering customer great question economically keith thinking baseline economics going subscription transformation take time exactly many year let thing play see business model compelling variety different reason one free innovation opportunity future innovate also client experience matter client want use long connecting microsoft cloud service connecting computing intelligence get economics fundamentally subscription migration path lot envision team innovation certain people want stay win 32 local apps using traditional experience younger generation going move fantastic new experience everybody able collaborate seamlessly economic model enables u past charging client really migrate cloud subscription enables smooth transition customer migrate cloud appealing time also think opportunity u add value driving different category innovation example case microsoft productivity cloud one thing interesting people think search fundamental productivity tool would hard personally imagine productive professional without access certain service today kind bifurcated go google bing consumer search experience go enterprise search look internal internet information external information think fantastic opportunity u build future generation search experience professional marketing person working pharmaceutical company go inaudible bing whatever type information right search economics part even though necessary per user subscription monetizing based intent know search economics keith wei qi luvery potent value extraction engine believe fantastic opportunity focus baseline subscription add value proposition make inaudible strong rich client move cloud move mobile inaudible time opportunity u augment model collectively capture amount economics got good segue search business want make sure get side focus thinking ongoing investment online business business like talking satya talked path profitability promising profitability fy16 weighing sort need promise profitability opportunity see kind extend bing today search today great question thinking following believe way model everything everything build work/life experience essentially every experience always work life experience fundamental thesis assumption believe future friction low people going pick service work across work life going choose work going life going therefore every product group work/life product mail used separate mail stack hotmail.com exchange outlook single stack outlook.com exchange cloud outlook client one stack onedrive used onedrive consumer onedrive business sharepoint one stack skype used skype business single stack bing bing future bing business single stack essentially consumer inaudible think natural extension workload experience stack technology work/life experience number one number two fundamental focus priority focus work believe microsoft brand market footprint give u permission give u ability differentiate increase separation user data usage innovation opportunity create group separation microsoft offering competitor going win work scenario first belief winning work scenario professional student future going bright use user use service life occasion well think reasoning everything invest work/life workload always going work/life experience priority work scenario belief time user use service work life scenario keith wei qi lu keith wei qi lu got term necessity seeing success mobile talk synergy search business presence mobile important window 10 adoption going kind taking online business mobile environment important least mentioned earlier industry particularly mobile really see phase whereby vertical integration across device operating system service drive lot innovation cortana one example cortana many way think extension bing built bing engine natural interaction deeply integrate window phone commanding discovery get recommendation lot opportunity way bing also support siri apple siri apple inaudible life back end back inaudible supported bing well one important example driving innovation using search technology search service go much much deeper phone experience still early stage lot opportunity build experience capture economics number one number two keith question window 10 option important window 10 think really gigantic milestone revitalize window franchise particularly modern device mobile phone inaudible particular internal alignment super super strong across different division based early evidence seeing going drive lot call smart search bing search part integrates seamlessly window 10 device particularly mobile phone inaudible whether tablet phone lot opportunity u drive adoption usage certain economic growth microsoft got wanted touch yahoo relationship well press perhaps seeing mercer meyer ph expressing frustration search partnership past progress shared gain versus google believe yahoo partnership going remain durable guy next several year challenge remain making sure yahoo relationship beneficial side equation everyone sort happy participant partnership going forward keith wei q unidentified participant keith wei qi luthe original got new deal basic premise strong alignment scenario two company particularly product innovation synergy economic synergy committed microsoft side work yahoo team drive overall growth better innovation across two endpoint platform bing platform think bing.com instance yahoo.com search instance sort inaudible going closer anniversary opportunity take another look see look like next phase remain positive plenty opportunity two company look fundamentally important u find way continue collaboration two company got want take opportunity open question ï¬‚oor anyone audience question qi front inaudible see repeat question answer inaudible â€ “ audience question break two question first part question coopetition degree microsoft working closely partner say like file share one drive competitive dropbox guy signed partnership agreement guy think plus minus perhaps potential revenue loss better enabling partner like box dropbox versus opportunity working guy go second part question yes great question thank question think largest productivity space migrating cloud going mobile world along journey coopetition instance place work case case mentioned dropbox certainly working dropbox team really love partnership going continue partnership meet drew team super clear going collaborate collaborate experience whereby make combined customer better meaning user choose dropbox onedrive also use microsoft oï¬ƒce productivity software customer keith wei qi lu keith weisshave better experience also clear going compete going compete onedrive going offer compelling service drive adoption customer super clear principle team getting user usage number one number two overall combined customer getting better experience two look sometimes complete positive sometimes nuanced negotiate inaudible coopetition deal case case principle going lot many many player simple reality net allow microsoft oï¬ƒce grow user base grow usage ultimately time net win core business think second part question acquisition strategy past year seen couple small acquisition like revolution analytic tom mentioned sunrise think calendaring app microsoft thinking buy versus build decision today likely going buying functionality potential larger acquisition functionality maybe heading adjacency common principle use always first declare want declare want always analyze three option buy versus build versus inaudible case going like case example mentioned acquisition want great product number one number two great talent talent many way also weighs quite heavily transform microsoft one key thing drive internally driving cultural change driving different product inaudible focusing user/usage focused customer orientation focusing designing mobile point screen experience sometimes transformation accelerated bringing talent outside microsoft microsoft combination building acquiring great product great talent case company really excited opportunity everything see come silicon valley said almost every week clearly best mobile mail client rebrand outlook brand momentum unbelievable opposite inaudible team every 10,000 downloads ring bell bell keep ringing opportunity truly u software acquisition accelerate growth core business additional question audience q unidentified participant qi lu keith wei q unidentified participantthank presentation time microsoft bought nokia mobile business mobile inaudible business going talk microsoft interested mapping asset nokia ask given saying regarding platform rest would industrial logic microsoft owning mapping asset house please great question think mapping asset product quite strategic u think navigation service guide b really geospatial namespace enable many many product innovation business synergy space number two look historically economics needed support mapping asset several possibility one search economics google somewhat 20 25 inaudible local intent part search show map screen case add fixed cost google particular kind even make sense leading business whereby fixed cost higher margin cost low add fixed cost microsoft little bit challenge bing volume nearly big google search volume founding map asset economically little bit challenging pure search perspective microsoft found mobile device turn mapping becomes service phone way apple economics work pay 1.50 whatever inaudible material enough phone volume fund well microsoft combination search volume phone volume fund ongoing basis key drive innovation particularly u focus using geospatial namespace productivity easily imagine sort interesting possibility professional going speak particular important customer either get place know campus map may get right building quickly way really future scenario microsoft best experience professional
