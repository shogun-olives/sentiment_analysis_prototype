fairly sustainable advantage end day everybody going use machine learning mean train people expertise machine learning quite hot market recently woman data science conference stanford woman asking advice said well one thing tell guy afraid take risk employable people world diane greene q heather bellini diane greene q heather bellini q unidentified participant diane greene q heather belliniyou mentioned building data center 16 17 year right think utilization cloud data center think mean think people look capex investment whether amazon making aws whether microsoft azure see step function increase given many built sheer reach across globe talk little bit think leveraging capacity utilization one thing get economy scale load distribute across data center almost provision kind globally see going kind resource network cpu storage lot study workload putting lot effort provisioning thing enough capacity never going get caught short lot computer science lot math going understanding provision right capacity keep maximally utilized possible time thing really expensive google would necessarily build capacity way advance given type well kind see growth anticipate going also getting really quick rolling capacity okay one question want wrap another one could talk little detail fintech excited oh fintech excited well huge segment market like lot data fintech lot thing ripe machine learning security paramount seems suited strength seeing also working bank project see much fintech mean since day sybase working fintech big industry lot diane greene q heather bellini diane
