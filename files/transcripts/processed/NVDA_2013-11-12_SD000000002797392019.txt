well delighted rob csongor vp ir nvidia u today rob guess going slide ask diﬃcult question okay perfect hi everyone thanks david good please note safe harbor familiar nvidia familiar nvidia would summarize nutshell say nvidia focus segment market visual computing matter right within image slide think visual computing matter special effect like see `` gravity many people seen movie `` gravity two people everyone else working right seen `` gravity special effect `` gravity amazing entire visual effect `` gravity done using nvidia one area focus company area automotive finance world increasingly using gpus compute model option model simulating weather course pc gaming market example visual computing actually organize company focus large segment visual computing matter gaming one largest segment gaming going 20 billion business worldwide year driven primarily pc massively game growing 14 cagr china largest geo market also driven u blockbuster game released christmas segment gaming professional visualization computing big data allow u consistently outperform pc market show latest data monetize view technology company monetize technology four way used two pc business monetized technology form chip board going market people want design chip license technology delivering complete system segment market visual computing matter expanded business model within recent history like going target roughly 15 minute cover highlight business focusing news last earnings report last week open q last quarter q3 highlight revenue 8 prior quarter outperforming pc market primarily due pc gaming desktop notebook quadro quadro professional product quadro actually record revenue quarter u tesla also record revenue quarter tegra q2 trough quarter tegra went production tegra 4 started shipping number device automotive growing opportunity u q3 also record revenue quarter automotive gross margin 55.7 highest gross margin company history dip gross margin due tegra business coming back talk little bit addition kind baseline business gpus growing momentum growth business significantly ramping opposed pc gaming growing 6 tegra tesla grid undergoing rapid growth momentum want highlight thing happening finally last week q3 earnings also announced intent return another 1 billion capital shareholder fiscal 2015 talk little bit okay breakdown moving part within gpu business show outperforming pc market overall pc market according gartner 11 since beginning year period way pc market 11 actually unit well revenue vendor revenue number slightly different roughly 11 exact time period year date gaming gpus within desktop notebook 6 quadro 12 tesla 43 mainstream oem notebook declined 8 mainstream oem notebook happen largest volume also lowest gross margin net result overall nvidia year date 4 versus pc market 11 pc gaming growth side really two thing driving business number one performance leadership within desktop pc extremely important chief competitor amd release product received good review right announced product within day end result good according review show grip retaining grip performance crown one surprising segment u emergence gaming notebook quietly introduced technology last year called optimus let u put gpu notebook use zero power zero low use zero power unless used end result saw emergence thin notebook use integrated graphic within notebook using playing game gpu turn end result design notebook without penalty battery weight example segment notebook business actually course much better gross margin helping offset decline mainstream notebook review 780 ti need go many detail already mentioned quadro business us movie let talk little bit tesla business new business u investing business quite term revenue recently starting ramp number key indicator look give early indicator future success business first computing system gpu referred accelerated system hpc system accelerator okay term terminology intersect360 research census system looking left chart growth number system accelerator seen growth 22 44 within last 2010 2012 within system nvidia accelerator choice think may heard intel got space product last year point nvidia gpus 85 accelerated system probably significant growth indicator look middle column none product none product gpus nvidia make worth anything unless apps take advantage capability within gpus probably single biggest driver ramping revenue last year time q3 previous record quarter tesla primarily driven one big win titan supercomputer oak ridge national lab computer called titan quarter record tesla quarter without significant big supercomputer win composed primarily application business accelerated tesla u good news data support increase revenue seeing one business excited last year introduced product called grid take gpu put data center fact guy financial world one target audience far location several financial institution trial product financial world us virtual desktop know guy use sometimes struggle term performance grid accelerate citrix vmware move vdi across screen see stuttering imagine gpu accelerated data company world product lifecycle management company centralized amount data number picture video form asset done develop way accelerate virtual desktop end result look overall momentum data point supporting growing momentum first citrix vmware using grid best show vmware show back october vmworld virtually every major oem shipping grid cisco hp dell hitachi fujitsu ibm last week announced amazon deployed grid server provide service people looking faster graphic gaming number apps apps grown left chart probably single biggest indicator path revenue good news lot desire lot need type service take time walk large financial institution large aerospace company show demo say okay switch overnight take customer trial quite customer trial ramping part reason customer trial ramping significantly also virtual sale force within citrix lot partner driving exciting revenue opportunity u starting lift customer trial revenue see significant growth driver company going forward mentioned q2 tegra product line basically trough previous generation tegra 3 ramping production late market tegra 4 late market made strategic decision move project basically next generation tegra called logan phone product called tegra 4i q3 revenue ramped back tegra 4 went production saw number design number different type design summarize tegra tegra android android phone say word `` android think many people equate phone think seeing android right revolutionizing lot market lot type device phone indicator tablet transformer convertible tablet pc quarter display viewsonic android display box automotive automobile android coming one interesting highlight quarter phone announced company xiaomi familiar xiaomi one hottest company china selling phone perfect example proxy tegra used mi3 phone new smartphone market fastest smartphone world reviewed chinese press apple samsung confirmed fastest smartphone world xiaomi launched made phone nvidia targeting android gaming market targeting largest android gaming download market world china within segment use nvidia type device use solution visual computing critical perfect proxy perfect example strategy tegra case phone launched sold initial 100,000 unit think 86 second next 200,000 think shipped matter minute exciting product let see overall think mentioned quarter gross margin think want show initiative focus visual computing targeting vertical segment outperforming pc market also managing drive margin area visual computing matter take enormous amount technology software financial result steadily increasing gross margin cash generation even dip q3 think q3 dip reﬂected fact tegra revenue come back quarter tegra revenue corporate average viewed good thing increased capital return earnings call introduced first increasing quarterly dividend 0.075 0.085 per quarter announced intent return 1 billion capital shareholder next year inclusive dividend share repurchase announced authorization board end fy think summary summary growth driver right gpus continue outperform pc market already outlined lot tegra revenue ramping back talked tegra 4 android talked automotive one thing talk project logan tegra 4 late market year result lost critical design project logan late market benefit received moving tegra 4 looking forward bringing logan market coming year okay question answer q david wong rob csongor q david wong q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor well thanks much rob one clarification mentioned logan said coming year help u specific talking first quarter second quarter order early well announced release date show recently editor day montreal showed demo running six month ago gpu titan face demo may familiar david editor day showed demo running logan mobile chip got lot buzz press obviously customer look forward launching launch date yet well anyone question got lot people lot interest webcast let use mic thank could know story closely could tell approximately revenue discretionary spending i.e. gaming versus would characterize auto perhaps thing asking opex revenue oh revenue revenue would say mean last year last year 4 billion revenue reported year tegra last year 750 million remainder gpus split different business year tegra number le reported le 300 million due one segment market particular window rt performed happen way thought going happen q david wong rob csongor q david wong rob csongor q david wong rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongorbut last year roughly revenue coming year see expect tegra one larger growth driver next year push tesla professional graphic thing go work station thing give u rough percentage percentage tesla plus professional yes previous presentation think put something august timeframe basically said market least last year roughly 800 million little last year little le quarter nvidia revenue yes also highest gross margin business know quadro tesla business pretty much top gross margin effect console upgrade cycle pc gaming effect console gaming actually good historically good expect good time console come architecture console know frozen roughly year ago time course cpu gpus evolve time console come would describe performance pc performance optimization console thing basically end bumping would call gpu product happen lot volume talk product sell 1,000 volume gpu business within 199 249 price range q david wong q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongorand segment market benefit lot game developed console question wondering see best embedded opportunity tegra best embedded opportunity say `` embedded assuming talking talking tegra device well mean like term like look automotive segment oh okay yes recently earnings call asked biggest growth driver see biggest growth driver next year answer tegra tegra side see momentum android something nothing short phenomenal android moving device market rate never seen kind operating system everything console automobile display box whole different bunch device within segment lot device going require really good visual computing problem visibility device clear think car one exciting u visible least car announced car like audi line bmw tesla s. using nvidia lot type device lot us tegra within application example within automotive first application use nav q unidentified participant rob csongor q david wong q unidentified participant rob csongorsystem rendered instrument cluster collision detection pedestrian detection lot computer vision application coming auto stuff older generation technology kind oh completely leading edge research development give idea report released recently autonomous car read first look like science fiction kind stuff already see lot application going car computer vision park car overhead view car obviously camera camera side using gpu create visual effect look like looking car require lot visual computing require low power tegra used one big gpus question talk little bit going shield day yes shield gaming device android market shield well modest revenue modest knew would like tried understate expectation little bit revenue shield read number one focus first build product really good read review review fabulous knew would take time get shield hand developer get really become familiar get become familiar hardware develop application really take advantage discover market get right partner get word lot way reminds nvidia gpu effort early day lot said actually similar early day getting geforce gaming platform pc shield gaming platform android gaming market lot type effort q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor q david wong q unidentified participant rob csongorthis one kind weird funky hypothetical question guess know talking intel stuff always said would sort competitor little thing guy recently stuff really compete sort big performance gpu side ever come would guy interested would something mean foundry yes oh sure sure love talk ask mean actually partner intel lot stuff mean notebook talking use intel integrated graphic playing game gpu using optimus technology zero turn interesting relationship partner thing compete others far foundry go yes mean course talk final question perhaps talk size notebook gpu market also talk china gpu market know attach rate china much higher rest world view thanks okay yes know know specifically break level granularity let try answer question kind high level notebook business u pretty business would say roughly half maybe little bit le desktop side predominantly point mostly mainstream oem notebook much pointed kind commentary business declining mainstream side think q david wong q unidentified participant rob csongoris surprise anybody declining think rate better market decline notebook margin side revenue side offset emergence gaming notebook like described see lot notebook oems jumping jumping make money segment appears growing way think notebook oems may exactly nvidia done focus segment visual computing matter deliver product market pc gaming market clearly growing think seeing second question around china attach rate china attach rate china think largest world u attach rate china think last time checked 80 largest geo largest business one thing go see whether icafes beijing whether mall pc gaming market china ironically china used synonymous making money software become poster child make money gaming software china everything free massively game free play get want faster car want better character stuff 1 ironically largest geo last quick question yes 3 billion tegra 4i talk opportunity design win opportunity maybe qualcomm strategy try get design win yes good question one thing announced quarter received voice data certification modem best way would articulate strategy tegra 4i articulate overall strategy tegra tegra focused android android includes phone phone believe opportunity phone strategy take modem market versus qualcomm know mean look focus focus always first visual computing within phone market modem help use visual computing advantage versus people q david wong rob csongorso think within tegra market within phone market market going look area visual computing matter modem help u case within phone space course device voice phone one requires voice modem device believe long term require data modem believe extremely critical tegra thanks much rob really appreciate hi thank david thank much
