go ahead get started like welcome everyone morning session distinct pleasure welcome stage management team nvidia corporation left colette kress executive vice president cfo also attendance audience simona jankowski run investor relation nvidia format fairly straightforward going fireside chat room question mics sort walked around one stationary please raise hand try get start thing first colette really appreciate great people live year hiatus really appreciate guy participating year thank first question tend ask really setting stage question think since last time stage stock sixfold think stock 150 year help u remind least remind people audience vision mission statement jensen company specifically try fulfill kind vision especially around recent acquisition like mellanox proposed acquisition arm sure great question start thank breaking ice holding first investor conference glad vision nvidia may really changed long period time set journey helping accelerated computing first app found could use accelerated computing gaming still heart soul company continue improve find great use case platform accelerated computing one great outcome accelerated computing ai q john pitzer colette m. kressbuilding look forward think u full stack data center computing company mean full stack mean start layer layer first layer think chip system build second layer would platform layer focused engine important much acceleration everything rtx ai simulation many type engine important u lastly top part stack software enable software framework towards application different industry designed full stack mellanox added really think overall data center computing world looking full data center every step along way data networking part great addition u continue build upon strategy future growth well question answer question answer lot company specific question like start kind bigger picture question state industry today clearly one worst supply shortage semiconductor industry ever seen look kind guy done last couple quarter purchase obligation 45 sequentially last quarter 40 sequentially quarter 35 sequentially quarter tight current environment expect sort supply actually start accelerate actually meet unfulfilled demand see largest issue deal demand greater supply demand greater supply working last 18 month focusing supply really understanding world changed term need think procuring supply range everything starting wafer substrate component contract manufacturer talk distribution logistics company really think also taking full ecosystem think supply ahead product also thinking supply system may enable downstream started focusing full ecosystem also therefore started procure longer term discussion supplier see going forward help enable build capacity need support system going forward helping working procurement see purchase commitment see inventory long q john pitzer colette m. kress q john pitzertake bounce diï¬ƒcult say feel good course guidance provided feel good beginning next year computed think second half next year think great position given much work already done procurement talked call back recent quarter environment supply tight kind take seasonality throw window growth next couple quarter really function much supply get question number one second question around given concern gaming around crypto guy done much better job cmp try potential risk kind silly think lean channel inventory today gaming think crypto big overhang could potentially come problem anytime soon yes first think seasonality get asked quite often term seasonality common question correct supply constraint really operating demand level need fill think supply behind yes seasonality restored clear term restore supply constraint world secondly think gaming business one probably impacted lack seasonality still case demand strongly exceeds supply channel inventory low level work day trying improve situation lot different reason causing one rtx phenomenal new capability gaming really transform game maker making game creatives working every single day exceeding overall gaming market whole continuing expand new use case beyond gamer creatives broadcaster additionally seen large rise notebook notebook gaming notebook still thin light best gaming take gaming everywhere great growth driver u well finding making sure supply well way oems important part work today lastly probably still cryptocurrency number diï¬ƒcult anybody quantify ca see piece lean channel inventory step done create avenue crypto money believe really good position continue grow colette m. kressand colette probably number one question get nvidia especially want jinx thing knocking door trillion dollar valuation astounding really tam opportunity many discussion think latest really data center question think gaming question think latest number guy gave last analyst day 100 billion tam look number think okay guy trying balance something big something credible know lot bottom work go struggle room trying figure tam tried look attach rate gpus server shipment look fundamentally nvidia fundamentally lowering cost analytics typically look technology one half ecosystem figure way thing cheaper half ecosystem come brand new use case always grow market significantly larger also augmenting silicon mentioned earlier prepared opening remark augmenting silicon software stack think tam opportunity inside data center time yeah really good break success tam large one created capability acceleration streamline entire path term process data think back pile pile data analyzed able get think world prior end moore law never going opportunity get done huge transformation aha came forth new platform approach really expanded tam easiest look attach rate server server going change overall configuration within data center regarding number gpus versus number server whole exactly best way look analyzed industry much spend procure data center getting understanding quickly would move accelerated world dream thought vision move acceleration fast depends come software approach software approach really help enterprise make move enterprise need help stitching together system software overall application framework application move accelerated work chosen large overall industry industry know would benefit quite quickly accelerated ai model thus absorbed created large tam started 100 billion probably last time stage white chair added quite thing well choice adding software separately adding licensing software enterprise separately favorite topic term omniverse also term opportunity also included grace cpu niche cpu really focused high performance computing ai attached overall vision data center computing whole focus q john pitzer colette m. kress q john pitzerevery single part data center tam opportunity large large get un unknown big market u brought software area get lot question think last time spoke oï¬ „ ine get 10 revenue think sort threshold think breaking standalone within financials one rate two quickly get guess third question exactly vmware announcement ai enterprise software dumb silicon guy hard time spelling software help explain audience software suite tool actually providing enterprise within jv okay recent announcement discussed amount software available quite large software new providing talked many year success really system software key thing provide free example cuda 30 million downloads 3 million developer free development platform also write software assist even beyond overall cuda thing bring bring market ai framework application different framework engine talked opportunity u sell software separately would big opportunity front u working enterprise enterprise key term assistance need say assistance need support ability license know come u seek support need application key work vmware important enterprise use vmware incorporated stack use inside data center see view model job virtualization accelerated server way cpu server initial important step enterprise well linking together bell whistle enterprise need application offer separately several right enterprise ai opportunity general availability signing customer within infrastructure well talk term omniverse well also something available creatives time time 150 stks 65 revised and/or new people look goal helping enterprise move world acceleration really question business going grow faster benchmark provide u think software might actually reportable segment within model colette m. kress q john pitzer colette m. kress q john pitzer software assistance term helping bigger piece overall purchasing infrastructure software multiplier infrastructure purchased provide metric along way term signing term software likely able see piece still balance sheet piece talk time time go back three four year ago think one concern ai market well positioned training perhaps well positioned inference view overall ai market end point would 25 training 75 inference fear maybe mix would exact opposite given core ip kind changed talk little bit inference side market talked faster growing portion fastest growing portion ai last several quarter far mix ai business go limiter people thought might three four year ago yes inferencing inferencing gpus extremely successful probably year ago sitting room talking going go world inferencing knew taken cpu world understood complexity inferencing front u important programmability ï¬‚exibility platform take larger workload inferencing growing faster overall data center whole indicate inferencing thing would inferencing processor processor inferencing also different thing a100 a100 ampere 100 opportunity provide opportunity training could take portion a100 divide specific inferencing type job even counting inferencing still growing faster overall data center including overall a100 overall approach providing ï¬‚exible system platform also software enabled many different inferencing type framework extremely successful mentioned omniverse earlier people call metaverse facebook rebranded want careful couch would argue omniverse background driver business forever think sort metaverse interface physical digital world nvidia throughout history trying improve interface gaming moving broader space curious inï¬‚ection point omniverse metaverse need ar vr kind catch think bullish trend colette m. kress q john pitzer colette m. kress q john pitzer colette m. kressfor trying figure little bit overhyped term okay omniverse piece technology next wave technology talking couple year great thing brings together different piece already simulation collectively let talk first think rtx rtx ability simulate light real time additionally done acceleration huge amount simulation high performance computing add piece ai done really omniverse simulating accurate physic 3d world 3d collaborative virtual environment think 3d world really yet thinking last 18 month focused 2d world little screen front u conference actually person digital twin would little digital twin onto stage ca wait day ca wait day well okay omniverse really brings together best breed everything developed architecture advanced year omniverse available include vr include ar everything collaborative u work space help term manufacturing design well well curious everyone investor tend tactile creature see touch something meaningful u seems like omniverse really going take first might scientific industrial simulation might first killer app room wake one day go oh god omniverse present yeah let start first though important manufacturing important architecture important area spend lot time collaborating across world team different type region particularly hybrid environment term working different space overall oï¬ƒce world taking large document look 2d design effective anymore one want see real time finished three quarter way design say need make change q john pitzer colette m. kressthey want single source truth design well wait minute version version 17 version 5 keep design world working omniverse really help many large manufacturer collectively collaborate design becomes real something changed change could rather expensive term probably see thing bot okay see call center see place customer service accomplished probably two thing would available every single day u additionally probably car little assistant inside car get home get judy house different thing also available using omniverse want go back gaming brought rtx earlier one question always get model gaming growth went back looked past analyst day think last time quantified could correct sort type cagr half coming unit half coming asp kind thought business look last couple year cagr 25 look last couple year well 40 60 think help kind form concern crypto related something else talk little bit kind think growth rtx really played unit versus asp think one interesting data point penetration rtx curve versus prior cryptic correction gtx yes think gaming rtx important technology brought world first architecture setting stone ecosystem begin work building game right number game using rtx almost new game important type game rtx seen industry whole whether working gpus whether working console focused rtx give u ability u grow desktop also notebook important piece ability upgrade large installed base upgrading last architecture thinking two architecture tracing important architecture popular architecture term performance think two architecture performance improvement rtx popular probably continue bigger overall gaming industry think overall growth supporting gamers supporting creator supporting broadcaster broadcaster lot different universe whether ar vr working term contractor enterprise graphic important piece q john pitzer colette m. kress q john pitzer colette m. kress q john pitzer colette m. kresswhen think driving growth unit asp yes upgrade bringing new user also pay per ad continuing turn higher end platform really make purchase top part stack well well one thing think appreciated mentioned couple time comment penetration notebook market discrete graphic help u understand think curve great story nvidia last several year would argue one key driver growth rate probably accelerated versus history important piece really working oems design working together ecosystem help understand put great gpu notebook desktop really transformed think world today hybrid work environment remoteness laptop workstation mobile workstation important technology enabled key really assisted gaming also workstation well think getting close full penetration go notebook market plenty place go think current arena oems working one ship right get ready overall holiday key thing opportunity additional penetration everybody high end gpu notebook mean business get lot attention good segue rtx provis remember guy first introduced rtx actually brought bunch analyst headquarters still visit pitch really rtx could actually provis business look business experiencing accelerating growth last couple quarter guess trying figure reopening trade helping business actually starting see rtx bringing cost rendering creating new market new application think one highlighted first introduce rtx actually could actually stimulate simulate housing real estate instead driving around seeing four house five hour see 40 house hour virtually q john pitzer colette m. kress q john pitzerabsolutely workstation market strong growth last several quarter would say part due environment really future environment creating hybrid ability folk workstation home well oï¬ƒce important able upgrade rtx save tremendous amount time resource finish work many great area seen entertainment industry term need create overall film helped stitch together overall rendering use example real estate many example creatives working using rtx assist creative whether catalog picture type thing done using rtx trend moment something probably take u many year another end market software strategy going start paying dividend auto announcement made mercedes guess year 2024 autonomous driving business kind winding legacy product ramping new core product think kind growth business get think past talked either 5 billion 8 billion worth backlog like period talking autonomous pipeline analyzed company signed term creating autonomous robotaxis trucking passenger car daimler market size 8 billion look 2027 see today still early day term providing sample continuing build end end platform car way think yes may start end move hit 8 billion total quite important part term accelerates first couple year important part mean infrastructure inside car also software opportunity creatively working daimler helping software share software company procure putting autonomous vehicle inside passenger car couple modeling question come end first gross margin lot headwind current environment inï¬‚ation logistics ramping new product sort view gross margin one two report january quarter one helpful thing gave u look next fiscal year opex much tell guy like u look opex rev ratio back revenue inevitably think kind opex given opportunity set front colette m. kress q john pitzer colette m. kress q john pitzer yeah still get asked quite bit gross margin probably one key metric people look semiconductor company discussed different different term thinking u full platform perspective best thing able gross margin incorporate software many platform meaning software gross margin gross margin successful look platform put margin grown particularly related data center people purchasing end card market go forward probably distance software becomes important part whether autonomous vehicle whether thing standalone got another ability raise overall gross margin think opex right tend try assist thinking investment level model versus revenue know important part company invest correctly invest appropriately enables u build product bring market investing provide assistance term know control opex thing control talk going forward huge market opportunity front u great exciting idea job think one fund one nearest boat thing need fund today thing longer term also want point time thing providing revenue today thing providing revenue little bit future certainly work time great come end time want thank colette simona everyone room joining u great really appreciate time morning thank thank
