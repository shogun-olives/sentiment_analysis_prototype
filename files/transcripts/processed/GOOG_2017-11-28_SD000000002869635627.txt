time day probably plane joking aside couple different area first one would mention deeply care advertiser customer partner relationship brutal reality google successful without advertising partner frankly partner successful reason simple look contractual relationship actually place somehow somewhere based cpc cpv roi rev share model definition keen interest partner ecosystem growing successfully need help successfully transition smb partner small business example digital world want make sure succeed world go large advertiser go publisher doubleclick business obviously based sort revenue share model go app developer go youtube creator actually want customer succeed spend significant amount time first area second area obviously service operation want provide smart amazing service partner customer advertiser big part third area would describe market market apac china india latam market like brazil spend quite bit time fourth part probably leadership something pretty unprecedented high scale high growth need think put right leader place put right system place put right organization place scale globally want global want local type setup need organizational structure need intend want invest want invest probably big 4 area start okay got got partnership many different form think sundar recently brought google great partner retail let talk google express new product time recently added walmart well target partner system well changed catalyze partnership really want create amazing experience want create amazing experience merchant want create amazing experience consumer frictionless experience platform google express heavily invested relationship mentioned senior management level take walmart example spend lot personal time shridhar sundar team walmart went q stephen d. ju philipp schindler q stephen d. ju philipp schindlerwe visited visited u many many year got point thought create great relationship think actually done take look offer hundred thousand product walmart available google express really interesting new new user experience example reorder thing simply via voice command already see go going forward lot interesting thing obviously think simple query google home something along line `` hey google like pick shopping basket closest walmart like 4,700 store maybe even something interesting pricing perspective pick think fresh grocery pickup situation trigger via voice command also ability actually link account together link walmart account google express account reorder thing reordered whole lot different scenario setup think exactly territory creating frictionless experience merchant side well consumer side right mean consumer angle actually fairly interesting think consumer fully aware full experience google express could offer reaction consumer continue iterate product think happy far said already staged lot come lot iteration definitely interesting world explore got right switching gear little bit advertising ad agency partner amount concern market ad agency disintermediated talk google work agency standing client ad agency world plan want disintermediate advertising agency actually working closely agency world important understand see supplier technology would like agency actually apply technology smartly use technology team world actually work closely agency whether large one one whether significant amount smaller agency well see agency trusted adviser customer client ideal scenario work exactly set u agency partner cover big range different use case simply using product take lot time effort end complex integration give example q stephen d. ju philipp schindler q stephen d. ju philipp schindlerwithout mentioning name one largest agency world currently working one largest advertiser world thinking example smart google cloud platform deployment basically think demand forecasting model something customer interested creating platform help go route dramatically better assessing demand agency heavily involved heavily involved advertising team involved cloud team involved pretty good kind stuff agency working closely u customer interesting angle think investor tend think term b2c also consumer business angle probably sitting top lot intent data described guess demand data okay consumer want red sweater season go back brand say `` okay manufacture red sweater instead blue sweater could seems could useful guess data advertising client take advantage think term reaping opportunity far larger advertiser concerned 1 thing keep mind way ca make type data definitely interesting path taking product like know google trend product obviously larger scale especially well frankly cloud infrastructure product like query fantastic type data mining machine learning technology really good yes indeed data used correctly way yes okay understood vocal mobile revolution think cusp voice well guess revolution regard think consumer behavior change like also always question going background monetize new behavior longer term like opportunity monetization assistant well look indicated mean u creating great consumer experience say comfortable position invest develop technology along line natural language processing computer vision understanding consumer contact based machine learning deep learning approach needed lot existing core product think natural evolution think type experience going forward similar transition seen desktop mobile think pretty obvious see next evolution make q stephen d. ju philipp schindlerlot easier actually interact interface interesting revolution obviously thinking monetization model whole lot different approach take approach approach think really important remember seen evolution desktop 10 blue link mobile device say mostly smaller set 4 way really interesting need consumer get higher quality result go significantly smaller surface area desktop mobile already see consumer asking significantly higher quality result obviously picture going world much interaction key thing keep mind going back specifically monetization question voice always need mean voice whole lot different use case personally feel voice visual interesting use case going forward ask something might want voice answer back might want projected answer back either mobile device aware television screen somewhere room screen projector close use case imagine imagine lot really interesting assistive use case actually voice think natural evolution text today take voice take image theoretically take video sort stream analysis going like google lens product announced literally via google assistant hold camera tap something vision recognition help identify object whole lot different input method whole lot different output method picture future environment different combination work differently use case yes seems like almost five year ago think think larry first articulated concept search assist might need specifically put query need mean query count disclosed probably becomes increasingly meaningless time guess guess saying want cut right think perception query harmful search franchise mean mindset think making easier consumer take friction trying achieve right would agree absolute query comp perspective could expansionary number guess assistive assist answer provide could expansionary time mean look user experience kind mentioned right moving desktop let say limited use case environment mobile device already significantly enhanced ability thing always moving course many case involve mobile device moving much assistive natural language interaction mean look number already think 20 query app android app united state already move towards q stephen d. ju philipp schindler q stephen d. ju philipp schindler q stephen d. junatural interaction assumption use easier use increase number time use would say net effect likely expansionary yes think invariably making easier people thing engage platform switching gear slightly search business online advertising sort term addressable market think search well online advertising expansionary advertising market cannibalistic like bias think degree mentioned smbs like advertiser would otherwise never found route advertise traditional medium platform outlet whether google facebook platform advertising generating client would agree would disagree mean would notion amount dollar google capture time ad sector capped look talked advertising market people usually refer advertising market existing industry call advertising market right usually number see something along line television radio print usually factored look much broader perspective significant market usually referred includes lot thing everything direct marketing event trade fair significant market whole world 90 commerce still oï¬ „ ine think interesting opportunity general would say actually business connecting business consumer think long generating positive roi business think fine look sense traditional advertising market definition yes theoretically google express kind fit looking way directly connect brand consumer yes mean done basically forever right mean look smb business right look many thing right world operate think actually fit traditional advertising market definition sense yes sticking search little bit perception increased ad load search couple year ago 2 link sponsored link mobile 3 mean theoretically mutually exclusive philipp schindler q stephen d. ju philipp schindler q stephen d. ju philipp schindlerthe consumer experience mean perception square data seeing right actually would say opposite true mean deeply care mentioned user experience incredible number test experiment analyze deeply tell analysis done actually consumer experience mobile device look quite differently desktop device simply ability scroll ability swipe actually able preserving time excellent consumer experience keep mind query actually even show ad commercial query consumer actually deeply care ad relevant relevant ad helpful information consumer actually able show prove experience confident maintain always consumer experience absolute highest level actually okay mentioned many many different experiment going background consumer probably advertiser well obvious sort implied question mean mean would say probably really much much else optimize search sound like would definitely disagree notion well mean still lot consumer advertiser standpoint think actually ruth said nicely ruth cfo said nicely last earnings call excited still opportunity massive secular trend shift mobile high innovation environment incredible product manager engineer run ad commerce site hundred hundred experiment every single quarter lead probably 100 improvement system every single quarter obviously using world machine learning actively open really interesting opportunity well optimize system optimize performance advertiser partner optimistic opportunity okay thinking opportunity mean said spend lot time plane think apac emerging market quite bit talk business look like emerging market especially apac region mean seems like market le along obviously probably opportunity google interesting thing versus already developed market q stephen d. ju philipp schindler q stephen d. juyes interesting asking literally came back apac spent time china tokyo excited apac emerging market including latam market general invested long time mean 10 year remember correctly think tokyo second oï¬ƒce opened outside u.s first outside u.s. precise excited interesting development think example india announced product called tez payment platform product seeing nice number 7 million user think 30 million transaction since launched clearly interesting development see real interesting growth rate well go mature market region like apac like japan example go go emerging market whether philippine vietnam really interesting growth advertiser side think number advertiser growth rate advertiser side somewhere 25 range really really nice development continue invest big fan apac emerging market general said beginning actually spend lot time yes mean talked mean sort recurring theme guess connecting brand directly consumer think apac market especially developing market le infrastructure already built probably increased level opportunity provide mean great set product consumer get engagement increased opportunity product like tez capture guess incremental sort market share market mean believe longer term like google franchise emerging market apac could large already developed market look without making assessment size doubt really interesting opportunity mean look innovation going region right look japan mobile development side leading world look lot area look energy level look entrepreneurship look smbs already interact u look different partner look importance app developer ecosystem coming side world right mean apac absolutely fire incredible team came big business conference business leadership thousand people region came together mean see believe incredible region incredible energy level think continue well okay got let switch back developed market guess talk change made response ruling ec impact would business question ... philipp schindler q stephen d. ju philipp schindler q stephen d. ju philipp schindler yes obviously working closely ec trying find remedy situation think found solution solution basically say put shopping service equal term call cs comparison shopping service yes think solution important think remember define open platform sector really trying connect retail partner consumer continue case brought forward comparison shopping service retail partner actually happy working u environment think found solution okay understood mean personally know need really answer question personally think another intermediary sits advertiser consumer make sense answer question yes want comment one always look consumer experience right trying create great consumer experience especially said device remember smaller screen maybe even voice answer one point right higher quality higher expectation level consumer term quality really focused whoever provide best trying basically supply answer yes understood let bring home u.s. mean sort another sort regulatory fear threat regular regulation google summoned washington along facebook twitter answer guess election meddling well fake news issue solution think google would like present seems like particularly diï¬ƒcult problem wrestle quite distinct thing right advertising side one hand mentioned used word election meddling fake news world think really important realize policy place long time allow ad either deceitful misinformed actively enforced policy also long time think 2016 taken roughly 1.7 billion ad system 1.7 billion pretty significant number political ad side even stricter offered limited targeting option clear vetting process end obviously continue work authority everyone necessary basically avoid potential type election meddling mentioned even better going forward number one q stephen d. ju philipp schindler q stephen d. ju philipp schindlerfake news side remember mean want provide quality access quality information user deal content form spam filter spam attack long time quite bit experience dealing thing definitely issue google well trying deny taken lot action think pretty swift action changed adjusted search algorithm announced ago offered better ï¬‚agging product suggest example featured snippet introduced thing like fact check tag example google search google news result working outside organization basically information think invested quite heavily continue invest quite heavily providing nonspammy relevant quality information company want yes presume order get kickstarted guess ï¬‚agging fake news story item might necessarily true opportunity gain eï¬ƒciency time presumably beginning probably human spotter fake news item presumably train guess machine learning ai time frame gain amount eï¬ƒciency spot quickly something still requires amount human supervision longer term would able see amount eï¬ƒciency spotting type content without mentioning without going specifically fake news piece general way always work always maybe bit exaggerated way usually work obviously try use machine learning algorithm better get better get mentioned business identifying approach long time think latest generation machine learning really help obviously helpful many case basically circular approach use basically human better understand thing going use input human radar train machine learning algorithm machine learning algorithm go become better go human becomes circular course expect scale effect time coming quality improvement machine learning algorithm got switching topic let talk ad blocking mean technology potential harm business seems little bit odd see proactively proposing add chrome browser seems like conï¬‚ict interest navigate guess effectively inaudible q stephen d. ju philipp schindler q stephen d. ju philipp schindlerthat good question think doubt apps amazing consumer experience also doubt ad probably highest quality actually hurt overall web ecosystem web ecosystem large extent order supply attractive many case free content relies great consumer experience ad perspective well done working coalition better ad say coalition better ad actually lead work closely first understanding bad ad experience fully based consumer research based lot consumer research identified certain type ad specifically bad like full interstitials ad automatically playing like instantly interrupting sound ï¬‚ashy ad type experience user negative 100 take look consumer product chrome case chrome long time tried provide incredible web browsing experience offered thing like blocker long time bringing thing together actually see make sense announced somewhere early 2018 thinking actually taking better ad standard developed coalition integration google chrome give overall healthier better consumer experience personally think everybody benefit okay conversation publisher mean presumably probably playing within guardrail probably might playing within guardrail revenue bound affected well long term make sense publisher offer really bad advertising experience 2 effect number one either ad blocker rate go time spent site go right time sustainable publisher think talked ecosystem fact actually good overall ecosystem ad way forward okay understood question talked different way machine learning affecting ad product guess ad agency mentioned smbs earlier well mean bunch new product help deploy money online well mean advertiser might sophisticated think automated bidding product think within youtube think creative tool allows multiple creatives target effectively talk different way trying take using machine learning take friction advertiser ... q stephen d. ju philipp schindleryes mean yes really using machine learning everywhere advertising side many many place mean go lot different area take look whole world audience targeting product like universal app campaign see successful core whole product identifying new audience based machine learning algorithm take look creative world brieï¬‚y mentioned think announced couple month ago product called director mix youtube help basically video creatives whole bunch bunch different variation mean would impossible world scale quality way offer go whole world bidding mentioned smart bidding improvement bidding algorithm right bit right time exactly millisecond make sense smart bidding product extremely successful see advertiser whether small advertiser large advertiser significant rate actually moving towards based sophisticated machine learning background take look whole world measurement example latest attribution product giving much holistic view attribution versus traditional last click attribution path much machine literally deploy machine learning across advertising system moment always intent actually create better roi advertiser partner smbs actually happy result great right think time thanks much phil joining u thank thank much thank thank
