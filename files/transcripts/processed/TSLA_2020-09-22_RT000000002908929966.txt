company update review pleasure introduce tesla ceo mr.elon musk hi everyone well mean definitely new approach tesla movie theater basically good see everyone little hard read room car way could hopefully cool hopefully hear guy hear okay right great well thanks coming think incredible year like thank support tough time good time great really appreciate everyone put hard earned money tesla think worked pretty well good year think many good year come go sort shareholder presentation fairly quickly sort real main event battery day really going recap happened past year starting yeah term ability create factory huge kudos tesla shanghai team able go literally direct pile volume production 15 month like think something really quite noteworthy tesla foreign manufacturer 100 owned factory china often well understood appreciated 100 owned foreign factory china really big deal paying huge dividend really would result year without great effort tesla china team super appreciative see shanghai factory continue scale quite bit right think really could expect overtime factory produce million vehicle year yes cool let see probably also reached past year volume production model smoothest launch ever think definitely getting better new vehicle launch building factory scaling production heard say hardest thing scaling production especially new technology insanely diﬃcult making prototype relatively easy think like real achievement tesla sort car company term like making sort exciting prototype tesla really first company century u.s. first u.s. company u.s. reach volume production sustainably profitable like crazy thing really happened 100 year actual super hard part four vehicle volume production s3xy also toughest joke think maybe ever diﬃcult joke make also introduced lowest cost solar u.s. 1.49 watt really simplified whole chain whole value chain reduced sale advertising got rid bunch unnecessary cost really relying upon fact lowest cost eﬃcient solar u.s. providing retrofit solarglass roof think really great product hard product make work major product line future also got four consecutive quarter gaap profitability diﬃcult yeah certainly testament hard work people tesla mean extremely diﬃcult time wide range adverse circumstance insanely hard got done think future looking like think promising sort annual profitability standpoint order achieve order sort well financially really need economy scale need ideally best technology think best technology also achieving economy scale also rapidly improving autonomy massive value add car think value tesla going like total vehicle side total vehicle produced time value autonomy way think future value tesla also consistent free cash ﬂow generation really important growth key element tightening time car ordered built delivered company growing rapidly extremely important tighten supply chain part arrive put car quickly deliver car quickly customer inside sort kind payable timeline faster grow cash conversely unable within payable timeline faster grow le money obviously bad situation tightening part moved quickly factory put car get customer make massive difference cash ﬂow generation mean extremely important factory continent least factory continent impossible achieve factory china able serve china soon many country region key u tightening total sort chain cash ﬂow getting essentially faster grow cash really important also important giga berlin complete factory china factory factory u.s. soon second factory u.s. austin factory europe mean even giga texas austin even exactly class california would still advantageous roughly way across u.s term delivering car central u.s. east coast far faster cost le fundamentally improves economics think also maybe something fully appreciated important factory least continent reasonably close end customer tighten whole chain industry performance rest industry gone tesla gone think speaks thanks like thank customer taking chance tesla buying product really hope enjoying really sale saying really grow word mouth really think pure pure sense like growing basis existing owner recommending new customer really think good way grow 2019 50 growth think really pretty well 2020 probably somewhere 30 40 growth despite lot diﬃcult circumstance mean many pandemic wildfire like whole bunch diﬃcult production issue thanks hard work tesla team lot innovative approach overcoming issue able still see good growth one diﬃcult fact say probably diﬃcult year tesla existence also published extended impact report tesla try hard right thing think happen may made mistake aware always try right thing best ability publish extended impact report show sort okay right wrong better future definitely trying accomplish good occasionally make mistake work quickly fix right thing worth looking like average like stuff average life cycle emission u.s. much better tesla electric car kind gasoline car talk battery day also much grid around world actually especially u.s. greening actually much faster think people realize u.s. moving towards sustainable energy move sustainable energy effectively end building solar factory car factory solar time sustainable energy time even mine sustainable energy eventually get effective emission zero thing end also safety core design tesla car safest car ever designed lowest probability injury car ever tested u.s. government passive safety add active safety even better really safety important obviously safest car could drive tesla think people sometimes people aware really safety paramount actually number one design objective built tesla safety factory also becoming safer look sort accident per vehicle total vehicle made dramatically better past already better industry average confident get best auto industry autopilot functionality continues improve see safety report publish every quarter getting better better u.s. average collision roughly 2.1 per million mile autopilot engaged 0.3 mean profound difference really massive get even better confident time get probability accident especially probability injury 10 time better industry average like order magnitude better lot life saved lot injury avoided huge priority u yes autopilot front think kind hard people judge progress autopilot like driving matter course always done drive bleeding edge alpha build autopilot sort insight going previously couple year ago kind stuck local maximum improving like improvement kind started tailing getting need quite close getting trapped local maximum fundamental rewrite entire autopilot software stack labeling software well labeling 3d video hugely different previously labeling essentially bunch single image eight camera would labeled different time different people label literally ca tell labeling basically made sort case impossible label label lot error new labeling tool label video actually label entire video segment system get basically surround video thing label surround video time taking camera simultaneously looking image change time labeling sophistication neural net car overall logic car improved dramatically think hopefully release private beta autopilot full version autopilot think month people really understand magnitude change profound yes anyway see like hell step change rewrite everything labeling software entire code base.it took u quite sort new sort call like 4d sense three dimension plus time taken u rewrite everything see like going amazing yeah clearly going work tesla core competency got engineering obviously also manufacturing think manufacturing underappreciated general diﬃculty designing machine make machine vastly harder machine designing like making model 3 model cybertruck prototype really quite trivial compared designing factory make especially new technology want use new manufacturing method least 10 100 time harder factory prototype see lot company startup bring prototype ca get hump manufacturing manufacturing new technology especially hardest thing far basically prototype best 10 diﬃculty probably closer 1 software tesla hardware software company huge percentage engineer actually software engineer think car kind like laptop wheel software incredibly important alan prescott andrew d. baglino elon muskactually car also factory factory software extremely important software general mean fundamental three critical area needed make awesome company yeah soon three new factory incremental well one already three different continent shanghai expanding shanghai second phase berlin making rapid progress texas making even faster progress yeah factory trying also improve manufacturing technology case like model made berlin might look actually made much eﬃcient way yeah talk later battery presentation yeah launched megapack three megawatt hour one energy storage solution great overall yeah right think basically right right thank right well thanks everyone coming back little bit go battery stuff little bit addition battery stuff got extra well think really like say battery battery stuff going talk truly revolutionary essential tesla goal fundamental good tesla like look back history say good tesla good many year accelerate sustainable energy true metric success matter sustainable energy happens faster slower really think tesla ass progress many year accelerate sustainable energy going talk battery thing really explain going make step change improvement acceleration sustainable energy thank hi folk great going take short break begin battery day event stay tuned local audience today feel free get car stretch leg try stay near car going begin properly little bit see soon hello everyone sure thanks elon hi drew baglino svp powertrain energy engineering tesla incredibly excited talk battery tesla great great let see got clicker andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk yes got clicker yes yes take first perhaps sure obviously issue facing serious climate change experiencing issue basis incredibly important accelerate advent sustainable energy time really matter presentation accelerating time sustainable energy past five year hottest record look like wall co2 ppm obviously time like past really important take action running climate experiment insane especially transitory one anyway yes going run fossil fuel let move future run experiment longer yes talk ladder got andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglinookay lot good news though lot people may aware wind solar comprise 75 new electricity capacity u.s. year really major grid going sustainable quickly also worth noting length time power plant last order 25 year even hundred percent energy generation sustainable still take 25 year convert grid also worth noting past 10 year power production coal dropped half went 46 electricity 2010 23 2020 massive improvement good thing happening lot level need go faster tesla contribution delivered million electric vehicle 26 billion electric mile driven many gigawatt hour stationary battery 17 terawatt hour solar generated think solar sometimes underweighted tesla massive part future three part sustainable energy future sustainable energy generation storage electric vehicle intend play significant role three accelerate transition sustainable energy must produce ev need affordable lot energy storage building factory faster far le investment goal number one terawatt hour scale battery production tera new giga terawatt thousand time gigawatt used talk term gigawatts future talking term terawatt hour needed order transition world sustainability yes see talking 100x growth battery electric vehicle achieve mission going get matter fast intention accelerate yes basically order roughly 10 year battery production transition global ﬂeet vehicle electric average vehicle last 15 year talking 150 terawatt hour give take transition whole electric vehicle type electric yes lot battery basically yes elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskand grid side similar mountain climb 1,600 time growth today grid battery go 100 renewable grid take existing heating fossil fuel us home business 100 electric yes number think might grow even dependent world economy matures country high population industrialize could see number even let say like roughly 20 25 terawatt hour per year sustained 15 25 year transition world renewable lot yes today battery ca scale fast enough small giga nevada 150 gigawatt hour per year like probably expect make really pretty small grand scheme thing 0.15 terawatt hour cost much would need 135 fully built nevada giga factory achieve 20 hour year scalable enough solution need dramatic rethink cell manufacturing system scale fast yes think view question money money sort like ethereal thing really amount effort certain amount effort term people machine depending eﬃcient effort given amount effort want amount battery question like well 2 trillion tomorrow could make easy actually need organize massive number people build lot machine build machine make machine incredibly important effort yield number battery go obviously need make affordable car think one thing trouble yet truly affordable car something make future order got get cost battery got make got better manufacturing need something curve curve curve cost per kilowatt hour battery improving fast enough given lot thought many year say radically improve cost per kilowatt hour curve somewhat ﬂattening actually recent year andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino mean early growth promising kind plateauing motivating u rethink cell produced designed yes exactly ev market share growing ev still accessible see drew saying like starting ﬂatten little bit rate improvement affordability car fast enough got battery day make best car world designed vehicle factory ground next battery well yes slide show quite right look like show inaudible let get started plan cost per kilowatt hour plan rest single innovation research project never see light day plan taken creative engineering industrialization across every facet make cell battery pack raw material finish thing going go plan today step step build get goal accelerate transition make vehicle grid battery affordable basically thought every element battery almost every element element wo get today get future yes first get far let talk battery cell got cap negative positive terminal cell open cell got tab connected terminal call jelly roll wound electrode inside actually see look like unwind meter long typical 2170 cell quite long winding process see tab still elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskand explain actually going identified got anode cathode separator positive negative terminal happens go discharge cell got lithium moving anode cathode reverse charge cell anode moving lithium moving cathode anode across separator basic make battery whether matter form factor look happened today least product moved 18650 form factor 2170 form factor great collaboration partner panasonic new partner like lg catl probably others future actually slight note one called 18650 although slide 2170 first two digit refer diameter second two digit refer length help explain weird number like nobody could explain extra zero said okay well deleting zero nobody explain future form factor technically like 18650 bizarrely going forward 2170 got rid extra zero pointless evolutionary step going 1865 2170 bringing 50 energy cell look ideal cell design need go beyond looking u front u study full spectrum option see kind swept key figure merit much reduce cost much vehicle range increase change outer diameter cell found sweet spot somewhere around 46 meter millimeter bigger form factor like anybody could make bigger form factor fool could make bigger form factor fool yes exactly problem make cell larger fact supercharging thermal general become really challenging make bigger cell challenge team set sight overcome came table architecture maybe heard basically remove thermal problem equation allows u go absolute lowest cost form factor simplest manufacturing process mean talk table kind beautiful thing andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglinothat mean esoteric nobody could figure yes basically took existing foil laser pattered enabled dozen connection active material shingled spiral see simpler manufacturing fewer part 50 millimeter versus 250 millimeter electrical path length get thermal benefit yes important appreciate like basically distance electron travel much le actually shorter path length large table cell smaller cell tab big deal even though cell bigger actually power power weight ratio actually better smallest cell tab like quite hard nobody done really took tremendous amount effort within tesla engineering figure make freaking table cell actually work connect top cap whole bunch thing keeping little secret sauce telling everything sometimes elegant simple still hard took u lot trial happy ended yes mean everything simple recollection see everything hard discovered simple anyways lot really cool thing going enable table really due really great engineering team drew rest team done amazing work achieving table construction sound think may sort sound bit silly people like people really know cell massive breakthrough cylindricals able get rid tab dramatically simplifies winding coding yes elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglinoand awesome thermal performance benefit yes elaborate bit like cell going system keep stopping tab yes ca continuous motion production tab keep stopping rate start stop accelerate really slows rate production sometimes get tab wrong also get lose little bit active area really huge type tab production standpoint yes put together go new 80 millimeter length 4680 call new cell design get 5x energy 6x power enable 16 range increase form factor alone yes pretty great clarify see plus 16 whatever percentage range increase amount due particular innovation yes list whole bunch innovation add get total improvement energy density cost number refer thing yes want stress concept rendering starting manufacturing cell pilot 10 gigawatt/hour production facility around corner elon musk andrew d. baglino yes video going plant mean clear take year reach 10 gigawatt/hour capacity important appreciate like build factory certain capacity design take period time actually achieve capacity would say probably year get 10 gigawatt/hour annualized rate pilot plant pilot plant actual production plant order maybe 200 gigawatt/hours maybe overtime thank let stack everything saw cell level cell form factor change enables 14 dollar per kilowatt hour reduction cell form factor change teased factory going go walk step step factory discus series innovation thinking ideal cell factory inspiration behind u paper bottling industry humble beginning century innovation enabled mass scale continuous motion unbelievably low manufacturing cost think industry really third decade production far go achieve similar scale simplicity inspiration set team thought marry cell design manufacturing best possible factory let talk little bit cell factory first electrode process active material coded film foil foil coated foil wound winding process talked tab start stop lot jelly roll assembled sealed filled electrolyte sent formation cell charged first time sort electrochemistry set quality cell verified set every step process try take inspiration showed think make process fundamentally better scalable one important process begin wet process electrode coating give sense scale going walk wet process got mixing powder mixed either water solvent solvent cathode mix go large coat dry oven slurry coated onto foil huge oven ten meter long dried solvent recovered see solvent recovery system finally coded foil compressed final density looking like wow lot equipment one step especially consider little speck next coating oven elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglinoperson serious iron involved making battery would great could skip solvent step one dig ditch fill kind thing put solvent take recycle go straight dry mix coat dry process really basic form see bench top literally powder film simple mean hard actually clear easy everyone would like dry coating electrode actually easy actually hard appears simple thing worth noting acquire maxwell like little year ago guess certainly good company everything dry coating like like sort call since acquisition actually ramped machine dry coating 4x revision full post acquisition machine still lot work would say like completely bag still lot work scale go like benchtop lab pilot volume production actually major issue encounter every level like make something work bench bingo make bazillion absolutely insanely diﬃcult scale yes yes scale saw becomes yes elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglinoso see motivation 10x reduction footprint 10x reduction energy massive reduction investment elon saying simple hard yes mean clear would like say right totally working close working even pilot plant level close working well okay think fair say probably work good yes still ironing kink made ten thousand cell thousand kilometer electrode mean fourth generation equipment learned lot along along way yes mean super demanding every atom place want deliver energy density cycle life supercharging yes confident get lot work along way clear path success ton work yes really profound improvement people know battery manufacturing gigantic probably machine revision six seven time large scale production rate machine improved extremely rapid like literally every three four month new row yes beyond electrode continue innovate every process step let talk little assembly next key assembly line accomplishing process motion continuous motion elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskthinking line highway max velocity highway start stop city driving definitely stop light traﬃc light everything want highway highway yes together internal design team make equipment design equipment coupled thinking make best cell thinking make best equipment could accomplish fastest part per minute rate tool development able get point implement assembly line one line 20 gigawatt hour 7x increase output per line thinking scalability pure effort one line 7x capability effort multiplying yes sort think like sort fundamental physic factory something like think actually quite lot like rocket equation got basically equation got exhaust velocity log start mass basically saying fast thing going percentage factory volume useful work conveyance count useful work value added step yes could break factory cubic meter section say smaller could like one litter section say majority volume useful work would astounded bad factory like maybe 2 3 including factory fremont think possible get least 10x volumetric eﬃciency well like 30 maybe 10x better mean factory 10x smaller thing fast thing going factory like speed density andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskthe faster go factory moving let say twice speed another factory equivalent two factory basically company successful company one factory accomplish company take two three four factory trying say okay one factory achieve maybe 5 even 10 factory would normally required achieve vertical integration machine design team grohmann hibar others allows u really accomplish edge condition one piece equipment another design entire machine one machine remove unnecessary step yes mean basically tesla aiming best manufacturing company earth thing actually important long run think company standpoint basically achieving sustainability fast possible think also competitiveness eventually every car company electric car eventually every company autonomy think every company great manufacturing tesla absolutely head shoulder anyone else manufacturing goal manufacturing hard hard problem fun yes okay let talk formation typical cell factory formation represents 25 investment formation charging discharging cell verifying quality cell turn charged discharged billion billion cell vehicle know thing two typical formation setup charge discharge cell individually car charge thousand cell took principal power electronics leveraging powerwall vehicle battery management system others dramatically improve formation equipment cost effectiveness density 86 reduction formation investment 75 reduction footprint want take one andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musksure essentially translates based know today 75 reduction investment per kilowatt hour gigawatt/hour basically 4x better current best knowledge think probably room improve even beyond definitely definitely yes able volume standpoint actually get smaller form factor giga nevada able get many time cell output see like basically get terawatt hour le space took make gigawatt hour 150 gigawatt hour pretty profound like would actually thought possible several year ago could actually get terawatt hour scale le space currently envisioned 150 gigawatt hour yes simpler accelerates terawatt hour scale need accelerate mission elon said going try even improve push towards goal yes talking tesla internal cell production tweeted earlier continue use cell supplier panasonic lg catl 100 gigawatt hour supplemental buy supplier yes essentially like reduce weighted average cost cell allows u make lot car lot stationary storage expecting make order 3,000 gigawatt hour 3 terawatt hour per year think think got good chance achieving actually 2030 highly confident could 2030 look size factory previous page really show enabling advancement achieving 3 terawatt hour goal 2030 manufacturing innovation fantastic enabling scale also additional 18 reduction dollar per kilowatt hour battery pack level wait andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino wait yes manufacturing system got cell design active material going put cell design let talk anode first let talk silicon silicon awesome awesome abundant element earth crust oxygen mean everywhere sand yes sand silicon dioxide yes happens store 9x lithium graphite typical anode material battery today everybody using main reason challenge silicon expands 4x fully charged lithium basically expansion stress particle particle start cracking start electrically isolating lose capacity energy retention battery start fade also gum passivation layer keep reforming particle expand yes basically silicon cookie crumbles get gooey basically happens good analogy yes current approach solve exist mean silicon car right involved highly engineered expensive material elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskscheme thing still great enable benefit silicon enable scalable enough see thing maybe heard sio silicon carbon silicon nanowires kind space right proposing step change capability step change cost really go raw metallurgical silicon engineer base metal start design expand think particle electrode de ign code yes sure saw basically dollar basically use simple silicon dramatically le even silicon currently used battery made today use lot anode would cost yes silicon anode cost 1.20 kilowatt hour work start raw metallurgical silicon stabilize surface elastic ion conducting polymer coating applied scalable approach like chemical vapor deposition highly engineered high capex solution integrated electrode robust network formed highly elastic binder end leveraging silicon potential increase range vehicle additional 20 improvement yes get cheaper longer range yes take anode cost reduction looking another 5 dollar per reduction battery pack level let talk cathode battery cathode cathode like bookshelf metal nickel cobalt manganese aluminum like shelf lithium book really set apart different metal many book lithium fit shelf sturdy shelf cobalt yes sorry would say like exactly figure right analogy explain cathode anode bookshelf probably pretty good one sense need stable structure contain ion want structure crumble get gooey basically hold shape cathode anode moving ion back forth need retain structure retain structure lose cycle life battery capacity drop quickly andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk absolutely yes totally agree think people always talking like oh cathode going nc whatever thing consider fundamentally nickel metal capable chart 1 per cathode metal using lme london metal exchange price versus energy density cathode see nickel cheapest highest energy density increasing nickel goal really everybody energy battery industry one reason cobalt even used stable bookshelf challenge going pure nickel stabilizing bookshelf nickel working high nickel cathode development zero cobalt leveraging novel coating novel coating open ph get 15 reduction cathode 1 per kilowatt hour yes nickel want yes sure order scale really need make sure constrained total nickel availability actually spoke ceo biggest mining company world said please make nickel important think going make nickel also think need kind approach battery starting iron kind like medium range nickel manganese sort medium plus intermediate high nickel application like cyber truck semi yes something like semi truck extremely important high energy density order get give sort iron bit time like look watt hour per kilogram cathode level iron look like nickel twice good fully considered pack level everything else taken account nickel maybe 50 60 better iron iron little better would seem look pack level fully considered good nickel nickel like 50 60 better still actually pretty good good stationary storage application energy density paramount like said intermediate kind nickel manganese relatively straightforward cathode third nickel manganese would allow u make 50 cell volume amount nickel andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino little energy yes enough still want use 100 nickel something like semi truck really much sacrifice yes beyond metal lot people spent time talking metal actually cathode process big target 35 cathode dollar per transferring final form see big target decided take view traditional cathode process effectively start start left metal mine first thing happens metal mind changed intermediate thing called metal sulfate happened chemist wanted long time ago making cathode take intermediate thing called metal sulfate add chemical add whole bunch water whole bunch stuff happens middle end get little bit cathode whole bunch wastewater byproduct yes insanely complicated look total like like small journey nickel happens like crazy like going around world three time like moral equivalent like digging ditch fill ditch dig ditch total madness basically thing grew kind like legacy thing like done connected dot really think whole thing like first principle standpoint saying get nickel ore ground finished nickel product battery looked entire value chain said make simple possible proposing process see whole le whole lot le going get rid intermediate metal water final elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskproduct cathode recirculate water waste water summer summarize 66 reduction capex investment 76 reduction process cost zero waste water much scalable solution think fact actually directly consuming raw metal nickel powder dramatically simplifies metal refining part whole process eliminate billion battery grade nickel intermediate production needed also use process previous page directly consume metal powder coming recycled electric vehicle good storage battery process enables simpler mining simple recycling process obviously going go start building cathode facility north america leveraging north american resource exist nickel lithium localizing cathode supply chain production reduce mile traveled material end cathode 80 huge cost yes clear cathode production would part tesla cell production plant basically raw material coming mine raw material mine come battery note way lithium end cell cathode obviously site lithium conversion well using new process going pioneer sulfate free process skip intermediate 33 reduction lithium cost 100 electric facility located cathode plant yes important note massive amount lithium earth lithium like oil massive amount pretty much everywhere fact enough lithium united state convert entire united state ﬂeet electric like car united state like 300 million something like every vehicle united state converted electric using lithium available united state discovered today yes already know good andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino people really even looking yes people trying like widely available important say like okay smartest way take ore extract lithium environmentally friendly way actually discovered looking sort first principle physic standpoint instead way always done found actually use table salt sodium chloride basically extract lithium ore. nobody done best knowledge nobody done sort element reusable sustainable way obtaining lithium actually got right lithium clay deposit nevada 10,000 acre 10,000 acre nature mining actually think also environmentally sensitive sort take chunk dirt ground remove lithium put chunk dirt back look pretty much look like terrible yes nice simply mix clay salt put water salt come lithium done yes pretty crazy yes really excited really enough lithium nevada alone electrify entire u.s. ﬂeet yes guess true actually nevada basically much damn lithium earth crazy one common element planet elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskand eventually said beginning get steady state 20 terawatt hour per year production transfer entire ﬂeet power plant home heating battery industry heating vehicle electric point awesome resource battery recycle make new battery need mining point see difference value material coming back vehicle versus ground always go vehicle recycle 100 vehicle battery today actually starting pilot full scale recycling production gigafactory reno next quarter continue develop process recycling return yes mean date done think recycle battery effectively especially since battery making battery thing recycling whereas like third party recyclers consider battery kind yes think actually mean recycling resource always 10 greater year delayed battery last really long time eventually way resource made available investing recycling facility nevada yes new battery come old battery ﬂeet reach steady state right okay talked scaling cathode recycling benefit saw added benefit 12 reduction dollar per kilowatt hour battery pack level almost half cost goal one section take away elon mean architecture wanting tesla long time finally finally figured think way electric car future ultimately made right way thing start single piece casting single piece casting front body rear body order commissioned largest casting machine ever made currently working road fremont plant pretty sweet making entire currently making entire rear section car single piece high pressure die cast aluminum order actually develop alloy wanted casting alloy require coating heat treatment big deal casting especially large casting heat treated afterwards tends deform kind like like potato chip thing hard keep large casting shape order achieve alloy existed could developed alloy special alloy aluminum high strength without heat treat castable great achievement material team fact general got lot advanced material coming tesla new alloy material never existed basically making front rear car single piece interface call structural battery battery first time dual use battery use energy device structure absolutely way thing done early day aircraft would carry fuel tank cargo fuel tank actually quite diﬃcult carry like basically worse cargo kind bolt diﬃcult somebody said hey make wing tank make fuel tank wing shape airplane fuel tank wing fuel tank wing shape absolutely way fuel tank serf dual structure longer cargo fundamental structure aircraft major breakthrough car really quite profound effectively portion battery negative mass save much mass rest vehicle save mass rest vehicle portion battery like well really minimize mass battery make negative make battery portion battery pack negative also allows u pack cell densely intermediate structure battery pack instead like support stabilizer stringer structural element battery lot space battery pack structural essentially like like instead filler ﬂame retardant currently 3 battery pack filler structural adhesive well ﬂame retardant effectively glue cell top bottom sheet allows shear transfer upper lower sheet like like formula 1 craft like racing boat carbon fiber face sheet say aluminum honeycomb give incredible stiffness really way super fast thing work create basically honeycomb sandwich two pace sheet andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglinothis actually even better aircraft aircraft ca fuel liquid case battery solid actually use steel shell case battery transfer shear upper lower face sheet make incredibly stiff structure even stiffer regular car fact like convertible upper structure would stiffer convertible would stiffer regular car really really major improves mass eﬃciency battery casting also quite important want transfer load structural battery pack smooth continuous way put arbitrary point load battery kind want sort feather load front rear structural battery also allows u use move cell closer center car top one got sort support stuff volumetric eﬃciency structural pack much better pack actually bring cell closer center closer center reduces probability side impact potentially contacting cell go   kind side impact go order reach cell also prof called polar moment inertia take like like ice skater arm arm arm rotate faster bring thing closer thing closer center reduce polar moment inertia mean car maneuver better feel better know feel agile really cool really major say sort 10 mass production body car 14 range increase 370 fewer part mean really think car take architecture competitive product level better product factory massive simplification saw part removal casting machine structural battery pack looking 50 reduction investment per gigawatt hour 35 reduction ﬂoor space continue improve make vehicle factory future yes major improvement front cell way vehicle addition improvement said enabling additional range improving structural performance vehicle worth another 7 dollar per elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon reduction battery pack level bringing total reduction 56 dollar per kilowatt hour yes right stacking talking cost range got look facet range increase unlocking 54 increase range vehicle energy density energy product 56 reduction dollar per kilowatt hour battery pack level 69 reduction investment per gigawatt hour true enabler talk back achieve scale yes yes think pretty nice investment per kilowatt per gigawatt hour reduction 69 mean would thought yes happened happen way mean 0.420 course yes enables u achieve new trajectory reduction cell cost clear take u probably year 18 month start realizing advantage probably fully realize advantage probably three year thereabouts like go instantly would really think bodes really bodes well future mean scaling tesla sustainable energy product make massively increased tends happen company get bigger thing tend slow well actually going speed speed going accelerate transition sustainable energy yes mean want try replace least 1 total vehicle ﬂeet earth 2 billion vehicle want try make 20 million vehicle year andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk think important point talked 3 terawatt hour 2030 problem 20 terawatt hour problem everybody need accelerating effort accomplish objective matter value chain ton need rethink first principle sale meet objective yes anyone sure mean mean mean future product confident design manufacture compelling 25,000 electric vehicle always dream beginning company even like wrote blog piece first car expensive sport car like slightly le expensive sedan finally sort know mass market premium like model 3 model really always goal try make affordable electric car think probably like sort three year confident make compelling 25,000 electric vehicle also fully autonomous think 25,000 price point consider much le expensive electric vehicle actually becomes even affordable 25,000 price point yes extreme performance rangem probably talk model plaid yes alan prescott andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk audio video presentation yes yes took latest plaid laguna seca sunday got 1.30 minute think probably another three second take time confident model plaid achieve best track time production vehicle ever kind otherwise order available basically next year move q question answer question answer absolutely invite people stage come team small portion team great show team q like give various people different question answer sound great actually know getting question actually know either okay well like maybe get car two second yell u know get question oh mics okay wait mic mics okay great great right okay definitely need give people mics otherwise way going pas mics q analyst elon musk andrew d. baglino q analyst elon musk q analyst andrew d. baglino q analyst andrew d. baglino elon muskwhat going name 25,000 car oh name 25,000 car yet great question though elon talked question inaudible yes manufacturing cell berlin yes question inaudible thermal management system home home oh mean like home hvac yes mean pet project love get going know maybe start working next year think man really make way better home hvac system really quiet yes super energy eﬃcient also like way better filter particle yes work reliably already developed car like heat pump model really pretty spectacular mean tiny eﬃcient last 15 year got work kind condition coldest winter hottest summer actually already done massive amount work necessary really kick home hvac could also like stack want say depending upon size house whatever much need basically stack compelling supereﬃcient home hvac could also communicate car know coming andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino q analyst elon musk andrew d. baglino q analyst elon musk q analysthome like oh need keep house cold day cool know coming home pack communicate car like really dial actually need cooling heating would great fun product yes next hello hey guy eli tesla owner club tesla adventure quick question huge fan car camping tesla dream case like favorite activity going possible get climate control back cybertruck ultimate camping machine get climate control try yes agree would really cool yes right next hello fan elon great guy question ice industry look like future well think ice industry long term yes mean well guess might like thing like like curious thing mean still like steam engine made somewhere like basically sort quirky collector item mean future internal combustion engine car hi elon left white model y. ryan mccaffrey ride lightning tesla podcast curious cybertruck interesting see battery technology front sort curious see production front volume truck popular america see elon musk q ross gerber elon muskvolume equaling 3 future also able get tesla able legally sold texas part giga texas deal well hard say volume exactly would cybertruck order gigantic like know well 0.5 million order think maybe 600,000 lot basically stopped counting think probably room know least like unit volume like 250,000 300,000 year maybe designing cybertruck meet american spec try design car meet global superset global requirement basically ca make cybertruck impossible really designed american market biggest market north american market biggest market pickup truck far large pickup truck think probably make international version cybertruck kind smaller kind like tight wolverine package little bit cooler smaller ca make drive truck like market yes going great know think probably able sell directly texas pretty well right bit able actually conclude transaction texas got like click california really leasing texas selling hopefully get cleared future elon great job everything ross gerber gerber kawasaki team amazing curious innovation incredible drive fully autopilot 400 mile entire state brown ultimately climate analysis done thing achieved direct impact climate well mean think significant impact stop co2 ppm growing every year mean say like try view whole climate thing science question much possible science always question hypothesis true true assign probability given hypothesis say original interest electric vehicle predates climate issue wonder high school like thought man figure electric car whole economy going collapse run oil like better figure electric car sustainable energy civilization going crumble kind later significance climate risk became apparent also able using tracking type technology access lot fossil fuel previously thought helpful lowering cost andrew d. baglino elon musk q analystof gasoline pretty bad total tonnage co2 put atmosphere greatly beyond people previously thought going presentation like absolutely monumental task accelerate advent sustainable energy mean entire global economy still 99 dependent call roughly 99 dependent fossil fuel although electric car kind get lot press right still still percentage total global ﬂeet practically nothing would say yes le 1 global ﬂeet electric right yes 2 billion car truck whatnot use massive amount work ahead saying like hard comprehend much work ahead get new vehicle production sustainable massively increase amount stationary storage critical renewable energy intermittent wind solar intermittent sometimes wind blow obviously sun shine night got battery massive massive number battery yes hard measure direct impact experiment performing sooner sort end experiment sooner kind move fully sustainable way actually lower cost mean think thing people fully internalized get 25,000 car ownership cost car incredibly lower prior car solar side wind cost solar wind coming battery coming actual cost energy grid going sort moving towards sustainable lower cost future like sacrifice yes true false dichotomy say like either prosperity sustainability often used oil gas say like oh well want people lose job want lower people standard living want make economic sacrifice really order sustainability reality drew saying sustainable energy going lower cost higher cost fossil fuel hey elon quick question right front first thanks everyone telling friend one company go work going biggest structural impact next 10 year scale probably tesla kudos everyone tesla done point going forward two question looked auto storage market know talked kind long term seems like lot battery cost curve achievement presented today really make storage opportunity much feasible next five year guess first part question calculus upon learning elon musk andrew d. baglino q analyst andrew d. baglino q analyst elon muskimproving thing change mix role storage becomes bigger second part question huge grand vision going tesla corporate perspective accomplishing thing obviously tesla ca alone look traditional auto industry power et cetera see lot tesla well actually lot company china think great work electric vehicle also stationary storage although see much u.s. yet think probably future know mean obviously everything encourage company move sustainable transport also make stationary storage battery opened made patent freely available really try tell company hey really need wo exist future believe mean talked blue face supposed really hopeful company also make sustainable future come sooner fundamental market size perspective like first like ground work show size market terawatt hour roughly 50/50 10 terawatt hour transportation 10 terawatt hour grid part grid battery making power plant making large investment asset greater grid battery kind thing grid market would bigger longer duration asset roughly size thinking long term segment new battery able disrupt electrify beyond initial model 2 cheaper sedan like bow boring company loop plane going right okay great like multiple speaker like get sound speaker ca tell heck coming q analyst elon musk q analyst andrew d. baglino q analyst elon muskyes hint model 2 big deal decrease cost transportation really disruption get height new cost curve open different vehicle category like high passenger density bus boring loop bow plane well mean battery limited production right exceed 400 watt hour per kilogram think number need decent range aircraft think battery time start approach 400 watt hour per kilogram range well yes mean think time see mode transport ironic exception rocket transition sustainability electric basically rocket front planning 80 starship liquid oxygen actually already running power line able use wind power create liquid oxygen making decent progress sustainability rocket front way electric rocket important future life consciousness become multi planet specie better keep hi elon hello josh phillips retail investor question regard lithium nickel industry likely price spike shortage material ev industry likely see act fast address future supply tesla clearly made right move necessary real worry potential supply issue price spike create drag rest ev industry therefore drag global ev adoption advice would give ev mining industry quickly solve looming hurdle sustainable energy future spice must ﬂow thank yes indeed spice must ﬂow new spice know think sure guess try like basically overdo cell production perhaps supply sale others see fundamental constraint total cell production putting much effort making cell kind reinventing trying reinvent every aspect cell production mining ore complete battery pack fundamental constraint andrew d. baglino unidentified speaker elon musk unidentified speaker andrew d. baglinogetting cell business hell fundamental constraint thing limiting factor rapid growth could certainly try overdo cell production perhaps sell cell others although going absolute top speed like like holding back think like making really eﬃcient car must lower drag coeﬃcient low rolling resistance eﬃcient powertrains mean kind done order make iron phosphate still good range iron phosphate lower energy density solution limitation total amount nickel produced every year really limit iron much iron ridiculous really scale iron phosphate raw material basis plus nickel yes point walking presentation intentionally separated different aspect benefit structural battery apply cathode way apply cathode get vehicle also silicon benefit apply vehicle well lot extend range vehicle key part road map going forward invite turner talk mining industry yes diversification cathode side obviously massive ev eﬃciency ev industry vehicle industry need see powertrain eﬃciency really increase company matching tesla powertrain eﬃciency everyone diversified cathode approach lfp used even really make vehicle lfp really goal trying present model vertical integration strategic vertical integration lot different people need see vertical integration shortens process path mine cathode novel trying push industry direction presenting model anyone follow yes fact anything guy want comment feel free step forward say something think key smart chemistry choice material choice yes smart material choice spice continue ﬂow need use kind everywhere strategically planning miner think incentivizing quite bit ramp production q analyst elon musk andrew d. baglino unidentified speaker andrew d. baglino elon muskyes actually good call like motivated think sort sitting back like going grow like crazy like yes going grow like crazy think indicates going grow like crazy miner want hear go make investment hello elon ben limpic musician wondering tesla future plan make partnership music company like done tencent game thing like guy actually kind expand service artist type creative people get involved producing content part tesla ecosystem people creative thing get involved guy well really thought much suppose probably something think providing title tesla providing music music source people choose generally trying improve entertainment experience car think actually go autonomous future importance entertainment productivity become greater greater mean degree basically sitting car car fully autonomous driving somewhere kind like car essentially chauffeur thing become important okay well let good entertainment want productivity stuff actually start become much important longer spending attention driving car extremely important future say dot com question yes okay second one yes first one think really answered like able make enough sale try supply company definitely intentional effort keep sale make enough company supply trying right thing advancing sustainable energy whatever andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino q analyst andrew d. baglinoso vehicle grid get asked lot think one thing important note vehicle grid unless power cut like need cut main supply grid otherwise lose power house basically backﬂow energy grid reversal power ﬂow actually keep light need whole separate system cut power grid think also case people really want freedom able drive charge house obviously really problematic get morning car instead charged discharged house sort okay either drive use battery power house think actually going better people freedom action powerwall car separate everything work basically combine solar either solar retrofit solar glass roof local battery storage basically become utility car charged also solar think like stuff work said like certainly vehicle grid think could like basically enable software europe something right yes future generation power electronics able le everywhere like energy market participation perspective yes backing house happens way north american connector car north america matter whether tesla connector connector vehicle actually support powering home unfortunate need additional hardware yes future version vehicle able least bidirectional power ﬂow purpose energy market participation even important remember car plugged 24/7 kind unpredictable resource grid value stationary battery pack yes honestly vehicle grid sound good think actually much lower utility people think think people would actually use vehicle grid actually original roadster capability nobody used yes question inaudible elon musk q analyst elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk q jordan krawitz andrew d. baglino q jordan krawitzhow find engineer everything saying find engineer thing yes well guess recruit lot engineer part world think tesla good reputation exciting engineering tends attract lot top engineer world know effort tesla really serve greater good super hardcore engineering tesla like first foremost engineering company like hardcore engineering like sheer amount hardcore engineering done tesla insane look say various survey done engineering school want go like top choice actually top two choice last year tesla spacex sometimes tesla first sometimes spacex first 2 top one yes mean motivated solve problem hardest problem world solve really fundamentally enable future need please reach help u work problem absolutely like said battle far le 1 global automotive ﬂeet converted electric even maybe 0.1 le 0.1 stationary storage done stationary storage barely begun converting global vehicle ﬂeet electric barely begun still massive amount engineering work done tesla company accelerate transition sustainability hey guy hear yes jordan mark asset management talked importance factory mentioned design process lot new thing going started shanghai berlin elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskaustin maybe help u understand quantify like financially meaningful improvement given trying accomplish company fair assume vast majority improvement given back customer form lower price yes mean think certainly try get back much possible customer like like tesla profitability crazy high average profitability last four quarter like maybe 1 clear like minting money valuation make seem like want try make price competitive without like losing money lose money keep keep losing money die thing called profit like need bring money spend otherwise dead affordability key scale right yes like demand go reduce price car yes mean important sort separate difference affordability value money desirability product lot people want buy tesla simply enough money could make car infinitely desirable somebody enough money ca buy sometimes people kind forget like like somebody enough money buy car making car super desirable expensive mean afford absolutely important critical make car people actually afford yes wish multiple speaker thing scroll something expect tesla vehicle ice vehicle initial purchase price think way answer question class vehicle sell today already yes already pretty yes pretty close yes factoring total cost ownership fact electric vehicle require much le servicing way cheaper run look like total cost ownership always andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglinolease car like lease car get loan car got sort monthly payment cost either gasoline electricity cost servicing fully considered cost electric car much le gasoline car nominal purchase price mean said like maybe order three year lower cost like 25,000 car think basically par maybe slightly better comparable gasoline car think maybe order three however technology advancement increased vertical integration battery manufacturing inﬂuence ability improve environmental social impact supply chain think yes sort said already yes ability scroll scroll away covered recycling yes let scroll got stuff covered definitely covered top one yes lot thing already answered think covered one think literally answered elon musk unidentified speaker elon musk unidentified speaker elon musk unidentified speaker andrew d. baglinooh saw cathode durability question let go one go go go good technical question keep going going address cathode durability cost environmental impact trifecta something going leave upstream supply chain sell think tried answer directly mean really looking happens cathode facility like currently outside cathode facility really inside removing process first place use reagent add costly necessary removing bunch wastewater process guy anything want add like go everyone like maybe say say word know sure want reiterate fact massive problem massive problem seems like tesla way ahead need everybody help everybody planet going get 20 terawatt hour please think carefully affect everybody let get yes obviously care solving sustainability hardcore engineering definitely come work tesla yes went couple manufacturing improvement kind look easy put together nice slide deck challenge like super challenging take material process integrate process together lot thing like immense engineering challenge like appreciate like need like get need like best engineer got got awesome team want shout also team watching like guy awesome like absolutely kicked ph putting together yes yes thank thank tesla team totally agree unidentified speaker rodney d. westmoreland jr. andrew d. baglino unidentified speaker andrew d. baglino unidentified speakeryes like yes rodney rodney westmoreland managing construction tesla would like say one shout team team working effortlessly tough project 24 hour day seems like round clock complete thing set u apart lot construction yes construction company thing set u apart integrated manufacturing process every detail come drew mouth directly implicated system building way would typically take three four month create specification design team working right manufacturing team allow u speed process tremendously yes definitely important part vertically integrated approach able design factory around equipment fact together equipment build factory lower cost quickly yes scott focus cell design think hard put word inspiring long time tesla really hope others join u yeah since scott since 2005 many thank year drew keeping track really stoked team able accomplish last short period time year really incredible transformation mean hopefully shown inspires join u join somebody else effort could think greater intelligent team working problem hi peter lead manufacturing improvement team guess point would like make manufacturing improvement like accelerator like think execution rodney talked term fast able put together factory amazing something really incredible part enough need improve manufacturing technology real accelerator really focused elon talk time really going improving system enable u get scale cost need andrew d. baglino unidentified speaker andrew d. baglino unidentified speaker andrew d. baglino elon musk unidentified speakerand point would make recruiting side like matter know battery come industry something fantastic work talk people industry would imagine like talked guy make golf ball stuff really impactful industry want impactful like come join u great tony working lithium cathode material almost 23 year growth seen company little year half hiring amazing people allowing u leverage technology industry struggling achieve answer question going really advancing material manufacturing cathode lithium beyond accomplished previous 20 year exciting yes name turner work closely team worked lot everyone cathode upstream material side really important everyone understand growth coming growth real going make battery everyone need grow u entire supply chain need grow u idea simplifies anything supply chain come talk u come work u let existing specification wrong existing manufacturing method wrong always true process equipment wrong question wrong quote elon musk yes exactly wrong question wrong try le wrong tell u wrong could better accelerate improve fast possible elon musk andrew d. baglino right well guess thank everyone coming hope like presentation exciting future ahead going work damnedest transition world sustainable energy quickly possible support help key success thanks super appreciate look forward next event thank thank
