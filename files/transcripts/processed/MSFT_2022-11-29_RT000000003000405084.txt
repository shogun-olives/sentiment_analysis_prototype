overall cost saving big focus second seen around automation prevalent customer conversation senior leadership team around automate thing like repetitive task free resource great customer implemented power automate rpa system saved 600 fte man hour able free repetitive task put people task cost saving migration automation hybrid work another big one navigate hybrid work taken interesting obviously around get workforce full remote pandemic well hybrid look like accommodating remote navigating thing like people connected social aspect big component hybrid workforce last would say still pretty prevalent around data story aggregating data getting insight eﬃciently running organization culture gone away still actually much top list priority interesting interesting yeah wondering speak figure energy saw graph recently much 20 megawatt data center germany cost power pretty astounding multiple speaker like talk energy top mind saw graph like ooh real number yeah multiple speaker see organization wanting quantify saving like talk 30 saving migrate application cloud like thing aligning quantify saving business outcome exactly excellent okay let drill fiscal q1 conference call start mainly highlight customer focus calling optimization azure state going impacting growth near term seeing term optimization get question lot sort like referring like area focus phil winslow alysa taylor phil winslowwell think optimization new thing think cycle particularly workload migrate optimize reinvest new workload normal cycle think seen cost pressure come bear organization optimizing faster putting priority still committed making sure helping customer seamlessly migrate helping optimize able reinvest thing like automation security higher value data data aggregation type workload think new thing interesting think even world new phenomenon like virtualized server optimizing cloud natural cycle happening quickly right area focus organization u looking partner organization help optimize realize cost saving reinvest thing like making sure securing data workload securing data center able focus analytics project get greater insight business kind taking saving helping reinvest continue move business forward yeah reminds little bit sort middle quarter calendar 2020 similar kind commentary satya sort optimization workload make way new workload future make sure state properly optimized next wave come need make room make sure properly call resourced et cetera yes asked priority want make sure helping optimize existing workload focus organization focus priority want expand exactly industry let ﬂip one favorite theme know obviously obviously big theme ignite year microsoft seven industry cloud available one thing seen like customer sort increasing wand sort agile future proof particularly sort verticalized basis industry specific used case see resonating customer future look like term expanding cloud alysa taylor phil winslowthat great question talked macro trend happening narrow zoom every industry specific set challenge opportunity facing take healthcare example serve patient hybrid environment top mind healthcare organization came forefront pandemic notion virtual health sort came nowhere real benefit term able make patient able service service variety different way also making physician effective another thing facing healthcare right physician 50 physician reporting 50 today pandemic like like seeing sort increase time pressure along thing like routine task talked paperwork putting patient data healthcare move retail curbside pickup something exist quickly come vernacular every retailer also looking frictionless manufacturing around automation building agile future factory digital twin big thing sustainable factory one industry different would say coupled macro trend specific industry trend dealing microsoft always served served organization industry realized make sure microsoft cloud every aspect microsoft cloud application layer way infrastructure layer way verticalize able help organization realize trend faster took pretty unique think approach industry cloud organization separate system designed industry done taken asset verticalize microsoft cloud thing like starter application data model connector apis actually take scenario like curbside pickup virtual help allow organization bring virtual health capability microsoft team allow organize data microsoft synapse able pull relevant data thing like dynamic 365 taken specific industry use case built technology actually enable used case within existing microsoft cloud horizontal asset alysa tayloryes exactly sort like natural progression software start sort horizontal suite get asset accelerate time value verticalizing function packaging point application top great see like said one thing gotten lot feedback differentiated microsoft azure industry lot great detail going stick industry cloud little bit like said one favorite topic mean obviously built strength microsoft cloud saying seeing sort across breadth offering touched little bit microsoft offer horizontal suite broad seeing put sort vertical context well look microsoft cloud start azure global hyperscale platform look developer asset putting power platform visual studio able build top cloud platform application layer dynamic 365 microsoft 365 top security kind wrap around microsoft cloud talked released mentioned seven industry cloud verticalized stack continue look industry greatest need verticalization used case prevalent one thing seen actually recent industry call offer around sustainability able bring sustainability especially new regulation coming market western europe european regulation around sustainability carbon emission announced kar 27 use microsoft cloud sustainability meet sustainability goal regulation coming area sustainability around taking disparate data think carbon emission track carbon emission thousand different data source bringing data bringing data able organize data actually able report record report data capability enabled microsoft cloud sustainability phil winslow alysa taylor phil winslowand using asset like data service able connector thing like standard erp system able reporting directly system record use thing like power bi analytics top example industry cloud taking specific thing like sustainability bringing market great let switch gear little bit talk sort approach mean make microsoft approach different call product something motion sale marketing process perhaps even unique partnership discussed sort specific vertical definitely think start obviously similar talking hearing market hearing customer hearing partner start go called semester planning cycle actually work closely like collaboration team engineering team say prioritizing build partner partner bringing actual probably newest thing year semester planning something new got rigorous around actual bring market would say two facet new continue invest one account team vertically aligned big change microsoft deep deep industry expertise account level specialist technology layer marriage industry plus deep technical capability brought together across subsidiary across world new ecosystem partner ecosystem continuing make sure think even industry side azure side use case talked scenario making sure system integrator bring bear

ever wrapping last couple minute let say sitting stage two three year technology change trend think going look back say hey widespread transformative microsoft customer maybe people giving credit 2022 think two area first lot buzz market right metaverse think people think metaverse think gaming social actually industrial side metaverse emerging think one ton potential think talked little bit digital twin manufacturing think able blend physical digital world way allows thing like replicate entire building replicate entire factory ﬂoors able remotely monitor factory example able replicate monitor actually drive eﬃciency talk industrial metaverse talking phil winslow alysa taylor phil winslow alysa taylorand great austrian bottling company great example actually would go routine maintenance know factory need maintained actually stood digital twin zero different bottling company around world actually maintain actually monitor maintain bottling facility look thing like water output predict might break line costly ﬂy bottling company standard 30 60 90 day maintenance maintenance needed predictive maintenance able also expert around world troubleshoot without ﬂy think like saving cost thing like maintenance able proactive state actually able thing like lower carbon emission ﬂying people around world maintain factory able thing like understand automation reply factory make eﬃcient think industrial metaverse something huge potential think early cusp realizing think one would say sit however many year think think much prevalent type set technology company using eﬃcient save cost also sustainable interesting put top first think bridge think mostly world going coupled regulation sustainability carbon emission water waste another area going think top everyone list priority standpoint yeah 100 great well appreciate time like said thank coming great conversation well maybe check back 2 3 year check metaverse sustainability cloud love right thank thank phil
