window notice adjust volume maximize screen feel free ask question submitting one right slide would address q conclusion presentation copy slide available download post presentation via email let quickly touch qualcomm primary research excuse research available bloomberg terminal typing bi go specific company related work accessed typing name ticker equity bico go obviously qualcomm business trend overshadowed antitrust regulatory action u europe asia licensing issue particularly intense scrutiny business model perspective well royalty rate right stand china specific handset maker 80 royalty compliance shooting towards 100 compliance course next several quarter legal issue however distracting industry trend could affect chipset sale well royalty separately apple samsung huawei trying insource much semiconductor possible also losing share mediatek intel whole point nxp transaction diversify away sale auto sale nxp heavy intended support trend apple samsung combined make roughly 40 qualcomm sale include huawei contract manufacturer trying offset auto content shipment growth jennifer rieif look specific apple litigation well regulatory agency litigation number one key point going take year apple perspective litigation perspective well regulatory agency focus going resolved anytime soon might lot rhetoric side important long view key risk apple litigation specifically potential loss licensing fee apple precedent said would set across device maker pay qualcomm royalty particular scenario highest risk scenario would substantially pressure qualcomm apple intel ieee everybody else industry skeptical qualcomm device based royalty crux model antitrust side pressure qualcomm persist across three continent subject fine look global antitrust situation three specific category break u lawsuit encompasses ftc well private class action pending investigation korea eu possibly taiwan nxpi deal merger review u side cleared ftc lawsuit would impeded pending eu clearance pending china clearance grand list item want discus today established sort context around stuff want discus today want turn jen rie second gotten question thousand time given litigation review across different regulator break nxpi deal well thank anand well seen already u announced clearance expiration u hsr waiting period 11:59 last night really good news mean ftc pending lawsuit qualcomm really interfere assessment overlap qualcomm nxpi felt nothing problematic able clear even without investigation good news european side would expect similar u regulator actually uncommon regulator investigating company one set conduct time evaluating merger company pending another entity supposed keep independent different issue different analysis good keep thing independent mean eu could consider qualcomm conduct looking investigation quite possibly crash remedy nxpi deal general see eu investigation qualcomm conduct affecting ultimately affecting blocking deal affecting outcome deal anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasan outcome potential outcome eu side result conduct give u brief sense could happen potential path perspective sure eu investigating actually quite long time qualcomm investigation little bit different seen regulator way license patent considered standard essential patent whether fair reasonable way eu looking whether certain rebate exclusive yielding deal pricing could cost alleging cost pushing competitor particular concerned one competitor icera saying qualcomm offering large rebate low ultimately low cost factor rebate buy exclusively chipsets qualcomm competitor basically pushing icera market could ultimately hurt market hurt consumer long run different icp outcome think likely fine going levy saw really similar matter intel saw fine levied 1 billion time biggest eu fine unilateral monopolistic cartel type conduct look ﬂip one page deck look colleague europe aitor ortiz put together really nice comparison chart showing way way intel fine calculated comparing qualcomm see global revenue intel fine based 30 billion time qualcomm revenue estimated 21 billion fine would ultimately based five plus year conduct intel four year qualcomm suggests lower fine see fine 1 billion right got lesser period time lesser revenue intel fine think fine likely two statement objection eu seem pretty dug conduct said right anand looking qualcomm tend fight thing lot success fight antitrust action likely fight keep fighting could continue drag jennifer rie anand srinivasan matt larsonso nothing resolution near term timeline perspective look regulatory action u china taiwan korea impediment closure nxpi deal absolutely right expect deal likely get cleared within timeline kind set said end 2017 need formalize filing china eu still get time clock started still plenty time passed one big hurdle yesterday getting u clearance think likely able get wo affected regulatory review yeah point 16 share tendered yesterday 17 last disclosed jen pointed time clock even started europe china got long way go deal closure ahead regulatory clearance required matt larson intellectual property analyst let talk apple give u context case could dive detail sep industry standard practice everybody problem qualcomm royalty inaudible different standard industry practice yeah sure thanks anand bunch question one parse little bit essentially boil think qualcomm two component chip sale patent licensing le focused patent licensing large portion qualcomm patent licensing revenue driven standard essential patent kind quick primer standard essential patent sep patent cover technology incorporated industry interoperability standard standard industry group get together representative involved company sit kind agree tech going either fix current generation technology future generation group like 3rd generation partnership project 3gpp sc ieee group people get together promulgate standard part standard setting process company offer technology get incorporated tech everybody going use technology covered patent part participating group company agree license patent participant people use interoperability standard frand term frand acronym fair reasonable anand srinivasandiscriminatory basically mean everybody agrees license patent effectively roughly relatively low rate idea want promote use standard time want compensate people done r order build standard circling back round dispute qualcomm sits qualcomm actively engaged standard setting particularly dispute apple focusing 3g/umts standard us wcdma focus 4g lte also serf little bit preview going go 5g developed 5g start get rolled various country next three four year everybody focused frand rate issue fair reasonable discriminatory appropriate rate appropriate royalty base percentage maybe percentage apply royalty handset asking price percentage asking price party differ way done company move little bit ﬂat fee arrangement company like ericsson recently announced preliminary rate 5g dispute deal one company frand term start affect everybody else license patent frand term kind overview sep background dispute arising qualcomm issue little bit different standard patent license think ericsson huawei tech pure play primarily r focus patent much combination chipset business company like samsung certainly chipset business also involved handset motivation protecting margin balancing license sep slightly different qualcomm whose chip licensing sep whose chip sale licensing sep go also distinction way qualcomm apple licensed past qualcomm currently licensed patent oems company put together iphone whereas apple past entered much direct licensing agreement recently ericsson directly interdigital previously licensed pegatron apple kind chair direct licensing agreement try get better deal sep dispute boiled lawsuit apple qualcomm directly got important note u covered qualcomm extensively past seen one thing remember often actually decided bunch lawyer trying interpret potential technical spec particular design see right way may therefore eligible enforcing royalty roughly right matt larson anand srinivasanqualcomm royalty rate weighted average handset basis device license 2.3 important note difference qualcomm others qualcomm qualcomm royalty fee based cap price course based price device rather price chip within device performs function part major sort acrimonious issue industry participant also important note apple currently licensee qualcomm hon hai general contract manufacture pas charge apple hon hai also make handset besides iphone hon hai one paying qualcomm royalty pay based price via iphone apple roughly 45 handset asp retail customer assuming apple roughly 55 gross margin one interpret another licensing drama matt larson coming back one one special cooperation agreement perhaps go another grand licensing dispute drag ph think think great way great way visualizing view dispute apple qualcomm lawsuit core patent licensing litigation antitrust concern unique qualcomm think international investigation various finding korea taiwan pending investigation japan ndrc settlement set rate royalty basis phone maker china apple lot leverage dispute plus way frame qualcomm licensing le strong arming people providing strong incentive buy qualcomm chip rather add qualcomm royalty rate whatever chip buy third party apple kind putting whole issue lawsuit effect attempt negotiate better deal think way way play way party least talked resolving last couple year kind direct licensing agreement order get apple kind dredging lot legal issue surrounding qualcomm business use leverage lawsuit multiple speaker frank multiple speaker back envelope matt came low two weighted average handset royalty hon hai pay qualcomm precedent respect rate acceptable royalty rate sort scenario zero best rate apple going forward precedent would helpful matt larson anand srinivasan matt larson yeah couple decision take look anand mentioned earlier diﬃcult lot royalty rate set close door negotiation frequently see light day people community kind know roughly everyone everyone paying core maybe five company negotiating one another le know offer pressure point system dispute boiled court decision get kind rationale court go least lawyer view patent licensing seeing rate certainly sub 3 asp look ndrc settlement qualcomm patent licensing practice handset china based 65 net selling price rate worth 5 3g 3.5 4g ericsson recently disclosed asking rate ongoing lawsuit tcl tcl ericsson engaged licensing discussion boiled litigation past couple year recently went trial asking judge set appropriate frand rate global license ericsson tcl license older generation technology 2g kind sub 1 get come 4g 4g lte license around approaching 2 cap look like 4 cap kind adjusting handset complicated move 5g going interconnected interconnected car wireless device longer limited handset licensing practice starting recognize get 5 catalog enabled router got kind cellular functionality cap based value functionality device lot multiple speaker actually know specific ratio qualcomm actually clarified charge royalty based automobile based value module go enables specific function exactly argument come line case talk appropriate royalty base dispute language interpreted language royalty appropriate royalty smallest salable unit apple commonly interprets well smallest salable unit chip royalty based chip whereas practice fc among company know royalty base handset tiny chip larger value little bit legal anand srinivasan matt larson anand srinivasan jennifer rietheme playing apple trying minimize royalty qualcomm obviously trying get larger piece pie calculate compensation happens next step lay sort potential sequence timeline roughly yeah sure apple filed complaint look like qualcomm file essentially motion dismiss challenging necessarily ultimate conclusion come lawsuit preliminary motion winnow apple complaint lot incendiary language everything see legal pleading taken grain salt lawyer working hard present best case possibly may look lot damning actually reality qualcomm file response apple complaint april 10th likely see lot criticism try poke hole apple complaint briefing back forth summer date set judge likely hear preliminary dispute scope case august could see case really starting kind note case take long time resolve patent case average patent case take 2.5 year district california looking potential resolution would end 2018 earliest party able dispose issue trial likely 2019 according court schedule absent kind settlement party able reach point look like fairly far apart viewing licensing agreement yet noting agreement going huge impact end 4g 5g license structured got hold breath point jen across yeah across antitrust long going take much going cost well timing matt said sometimes antitrust lawsuit generally take long time resolve federal trade commission lawsuit qualcomm sort related issue related apple lawsuit matt talked related way qualcomm licensed standard essential patent 2007 agreement apple lawsuit controversy around lawsuit right timing ftc lawsuit commissioner vote bring suit anand srinivasanthe time voted three commissioner two one vote need majority vote bring suit one left two commissioner left one one commissioner left quite opposed bringing suit actually came said seen robust economic evidence supporting fact qualcomm conduct caused kind exclusion kind harm market lot speculation two commissioner left one opposed suit acting chairperson suit could get dropped recently last week aba antitrust conference discussed bit seems several speaker expert felt would happen suit would get dropped would seem political thing momentum get going get dropped suggest ftc prosecuting suit chairperson backing could mean really actively prosecute could mean kind lamely go emotion sort state away maybe end easy settlement mean could quicker sometimes private suit copycat ftc suit common take lot longer seeking monetary damage ftc looking money looking change conduct private class action plaintiff buyer mobile phone handheld device tablet claim paid inﬂated price higher licensing cost oems passed looking triple damage anything overpaid since believe 2013 drag long time also suspect qualcomm fight really hard especially commissioner ohlhausen statement harm market due qualcomm conduct private plaintiff also show harm market sustain antitrust case private plaintiff show harmed show market harm ca show market harm done suspect qualcomm fight drag ultimately probably settle amount unlikely particularly material timing eu going drag could announcement sign next year sooner later term continuing fight final resolution way road nxpi merger like said qualcomm estimated able close end 2017 think really good estimate especially get filing eu china formalized next month seem news imminent think great chance getting close meeting deadline got recap equity analyst perspective lawyer trade 34 private case consolidated hearing couple day ago jennifer rie anand srinivasandecision four week right let clarify hearing whether case put one big case hearing front one judge one court everybody get put together happens case start file new complaint consolidated group plaintiff slows thing even hearing took place march 30th ftc suit mean interrupt guess said quite ahead ftc suit qualcomm yesterday filed motion dismiss suit yesterday good day motion plus u antitrust clearance briefing continue june likely argument decision could get decision end 2017 got got parallel process apple complaint qualcomm response date apple complaint matt larson mentioned april 10th august 2017 preliminary hearing subject whether apple case may proceed ruling might come mid late 3q late 2018 early ruling possible could drag well 2019 final ruling course appeal matt mentioned average take 2.5 year trial one complicated antitrust litigation 2019 beyond jen mentioned know 30 minute want pause take question field pause minute get question one question meanwhile polling accumulating question happens apple pay meanwhile interesting side note hon hai one license apple hon hai business would imperiled decides pay apple part pay qualcomm excuse royalty another question often asked royalty settlement reached slide look done financial analysis whether apple alone benefited royalty rate qualcomm apple reducing royalty rate little bit hit qualcomm fiscal year earnings material precedent question sends wo everyone else wanted look substantial substantial everybody else partake substantial hit royalty model qualcomm earnings power really come fiscal scenario people worried justifiably jennifer rie anand srinivasan jennifer riebut done past ndrc royalty rate reduced qualcomm fact appeal approach customer saying hey deal struck ndrc deal oems china benefit partake deal case handset whether handset made china question whether handset go china used china question handset higher royalty rate applicable qualcomm global handset oems make whole lot sense chinese handset oems shipping lot product region make lot sense able contain fallout may restricted chinese handset maker making product predominantly consumption china market alone court finding favor qualcomm mentioned would disastrous scenario couple question soonest nxp deal could get done could get approval opinion think reason really hard estimate wildcard chinese approval part reason china deal like tech deal go ministry commerce approves deal antitrust perspective also go one ministry review technology issue ministry slow ministry commerce allowed clear heard technology group slowed past semiconductor deal would say probably soonest guess really guess based long took deal get cleared guessing soonest could nine month announced announced late october 2016 reason picked number eight nine month look western digital sandisk look analog device linear technology intel altera past semi deal last two year one require divestiture suspect happen took six eight nine month nxp freescale took longer europe u divest radio frequency business think possibly eight nine month let say november 1st 2016 got remember qualcomm said expectation end anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasan matt larson end right end calendar right question think end calendar really safe question soonest saying may also depends qualcomm time clock regulator start qualcomm formally filed know formally filed europe happens european union european commission set public docket look docket set yet got happened possible formally filed china although sort doubt think would said something publicly got thank start seeing whether qualcomm licensee start challenge royalty agreement timeline royalty scheme changing qualcomm meet law suit want get matt larson remember qualcomm individual contract individual timeframes term licensing agreement royalty payment individual company samsung deal apple hon hai deal vivo oppo lenovo separate deal span different term unless somebody decides default contract unlikely royalty scheme would change unless material impact litigation perspective matt larson seen interim change result regulatory review mean litigation another oem anand srinivasanyeah yeah definitely seen let answer two part kind piggybacking response people start renegotiate rate license typically last anywhere three seven year thinking individual license three seven year skew three five year term typically thing start expire individual licensee explicitly stated guestimate thing come really negotiating rate probably two year thing expire licensee midst renegotiating rate least contemplating think 5g starting discussion already elephant room going apple litigation agreement typically penned take effect prior agreement expired seen number different case sometimes litigation party ca agree agreement end lawsuit filed party run favorable jurisdiction order try get favorable patent ruling seen ericsson case seen nokia starting see couple case filed blu blackberry lg approaching blu increased sale trying put pressure different jurisdiction little bit soft answer kind answer based individual license maybe three five year license signed generally apple people use use ongoing litigation negotiating point shoe drop kind determination party exited litigation really strongest precedent either settlement announced judicial decision judge issue something point say look legal precedent license body intellectual property like said think earliest end 2018 likely sometime 2019 see judge put pen paper come something people use negotiation got interesting matt bought timing apple potentially action imagination well look far ahead 5g potential 2020 2021 back drive certain amount r required integration required testing required come back current timeline apple always action rather word far wanting make chip see runway want take move qualcomm partially intel demonstrates could prep ahead 5g window 5g timing 2020 2021 could interesting another data point might want consider matt larson anand srinivasanso please another question please clarify whether qualcomm negotiating power oems making handset shipped china build sold within china look ndrc deal sort royalty structure one made china consumed china chinese vendor made china consumed elsewhere could la carte menu chinese technology technology needed china plus technology needed region world add two royalty together come certain block based volume shipment parallel could say okay global handset licensing structure independent region see one lower would pick one based volume insofar qualcomm negotiating power mean great degree math chime well great degree based volume complexity asp end market viscerally want adopt qualcomm business vendor would point thought add matt yes got another point add legal side agree anand said layered thinking ip agreement think worth noting ip enforcement ip enforcement going china right china last couple year built specialized intellectual property court kind recognizing reputation enforcing ip particularly ip belonging country abroad set series specialized court main one hear beijing got astronomical win rate foreign plaintiff trying enforce ip china think remedy court offer blocking export good infringing licensed china outside world term legal case give qualcomm kind go china ndrc deal hand lot leverage company selling china product win legal case potentially block sale inventory put hold also block shipment device outside world case qualcomm little bit leverage new legal trend seen enforcement intellectual property china kind add cover anand comment got thanks another question large number chinese licensee calculate value device service strong precedent apple lawsuit answer yes remember everybody matt larson anand srinivasanoffered china ndrc deal many handset maker making product consumption china consumption overseas ndrc necessarily purview address degree sort limit thing little bit number one number two also look apple example apple samsung explicitly understand offered ndrc deal everybody also handset oem wanted limit number skus supply chain logistics management run away look apple skus still fewest number skus large handset oem block look samsung example lot variety platform lot ﬂavors lot diversity across price point look apple example expanded number ﬂavors ice cream shop may expanded nowhere near variety price point diversity somebody like samsung offer anand one point note term precedent chinese licensee look timeline apple lay complaint litigation timing ndrc settlement corresponds roughly offer qualcomm made apple attempting negotiate direct license 2015 done quite well kind look laid parallel suggestion least qualcomm approached apple number take apple currently getting better deal take step back going factor fairly heavily dispute think qualcomm feeling good ndrc least perceived somewhat hostile review outside force might protectionist interest approved licensing regime trying negotiate apple think certainly bare pretty heavily dispute licensing dispute get past kind initial stage end year case move see kind company issued subpoena course due course business see licensing agreement company bearing happens ph reference tcl ericsson case went trial february ended march licensing agreement pretty much everybody industry sort judge compare see frand rate lining long answer short term yeah think chinese license bear pretty heavily dispute got thank matt another seamless plug bloomberg intelligence see diversity research different kind people bring
