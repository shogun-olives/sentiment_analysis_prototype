excellent case study yes eron met run piece microsoft business personally interested think lot sql server side well portion bi suite actually take minute mind describe different product set domain sure sure well first thank great get invite participate certainly passionate technology space around data platform exciting microsoft think time microsoft historical brand around desktop people really know going sql server incredible business last year responsibility product management marketing sql server database asset window azure cloud platform well bi asset span oﬃce excel well karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead eron kellyour new cloud property like power bi sort data platform tend focus got know microsoft never like get much detail around sizing particular segment information metric could offer u help u gauge big business manage maybe want put dollar sql server sort largest second largest chunk broader segment anything give u might help size business sure sure couple thing actually starting become little bit public actual number help sql server 6 billion business growth perspective growing double digit last several year q4 number 19 growth healthy growth extraordinary pretty big number premium part enterprise edition growing even faster north 25 seeing lot growth market perspective tend look idc gartner well internal analysis put market share unit perspective 46 48 revenue perspective 20 see number got lot database unit lower price point also reﬂection historically tier 3 tier 2 database enterprise really started change around 2012 release became tier 1 got lot indicator showing growth tier 1 u new ground okay sql server maybe lump together bi side several audience follow tableau click tibco spotfire microstrategy hear microsoft think investor really good sense big might bi side metric offer karl kierstead eron kellyyes tricky historically way approached bi market obviously excel client sql server database sharepoint presentation layer web presentation browser across three product bi business easy see single number think analyst might put 2 billion 2.5 billion across three take allocation one probably right way think billion excel client world bi course right people would estimate within organization 7 8 employee bi function lot excel product vision go beyond vision get 20 30 40 organization using data make decision way think familiar tool going big part also bringing together right information back end delivering user familiar way growth sort vision statement like say bring big data billion user trying combination new service released february called power bi service brings together best excel sharepoint sql bi solution combine pretty robust back end sql server window azure sort combination think really going interesting market strategic view bi sizing sense super helpful thanks one thing eron learned covering microsoft year helpful statistic sizing metric think individual product microsoft part broader whole integrated rest suite extent sql server touch key part microsoft product suite link pronounced worth ﬂagging sure couple place one obviously window server run sql server run window server tight correlation sql server also back end sharepoint server dynamic application within microsoft partner application run sql visual studio development environment target sql database another leverage point course oﬃce excel bi perspective making sort traditionally making lot investment last two release also make sql socket azure made investment within sql server management karl kierstead eron kellystudio dba life literally configure backup directly window azure right sql server tried make lot connection customer looking hybrid environment data may live data may live cloud want bring thing together big investment one sort necessarily data point statistic thought might helpful analysis fiscal year business looking attainment sale force sale account team account course care lot attainment hit number product strongly correlated hitting number sql server high correlation hit sql number hit number combination sort connecting effect highlighting also deal size getting much bigger around sql lot upside seeing last couple year okay let talk little bit sql server business think investor astonished honest growing 6 billion business clip oracle ibm business probably ﬂat obviously million dollar question pulling look almost good true yes would take back 2010 little bit history lesson help get sense going 2010 released called r2 release 2008 product included technology part analytics bi stack first step really bringing enterprise starting work tier 1 2012 really hit tier 1 product perspective brought memory technology core data warehouse brought technology called creating high availability environment robust stuff past around failover pretty good really good became credible tier 1 database remember earlier comment sort grew tier 2 feature requirement could command price point well 2012 could deliver solution started across two three main workload database product time made two change made pretty sizeable investment sale force senior seller individual seller karl kierstead eron kellywere focused sql server senior typically microsoft could really go drive bigger deal made licensing change licensing model licensing model got alignment oracle ibm already moved three thing product credible tier 1 investment senior seller could go larger tier 1 deal business model allows u better monetize happened 2012 really riding last couple year seen high premium growth still relatively small player tier 1 continuing see upside see migration tracking 900 migration oracle since 2012 tier 1 application thing keep close eye reason outside observer like u seeing progress hit oracle license number effort moving tier 1 workload still relatively early stage hence hit yet possible effect license growth would call 4 microsoft instead zero couple factor one lot oracle licensing maintenance right net new license maintenance little bit number think market growing pretty good clip analyst put 9 10 said ﬂat market growing growing faster market taking share starting see shift price point lower oracle third price many configuration simple math around move 20 core oracle 20 core sql going see le revenue going see growth using price advantage value advantage well one key reason customer take closer look say gosh app running oracle long time db2 microsoft brought new technology market product already know expensive generally le expensive got really strong value prop okay going start move thing take time organization want move tier 1 app work unless compelling reason winning net new project migration take longer karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead eron kellyand eron portion extraordinary growth sql server might driven another factor year back microsoft think changed licensing model sql server business think resulted net price increase portion revenue growth experiencing sql server price increase yes one three factor product sale force investment change licensing model cpu core happening monetizing cpu level hardware coming core per cpu customer getting performance price transition basically like everyone else better able monetize true growth driving core growth data explosion right data explosion driving core growth across board lot people think oh well hadoop phenomenon really yes sure hadoop growing lot data going hadoop actually increase demand data warehouse result hadoop deployment get combined existing customer record data warehouse becomes creates interesting view customer company see lot use example progressive insurance know little device car measure driving behavior change rate guy guy familiar think device create signal data go hadoop combine data customer record data life traditional data warehouse combination interesting growth actually hadoop big data really helping fueling traditional data warehouse part business data project data want actually combine traditional system great term product road map one early announcement new ceo made came aboard sql server 2014 could bring u speed timeline product going ga new feature pronounced new version sure released sql server 2014 april biggest new feature area oltp transaction processing karl kierstead eron kelly karl kiersteadsql 2014 technology bi analytics data warehousing oltp unique market one else across three core data platform workload really exciting release u part reason satya came board announce last time ceo talk sql bill gate 2000 nice course ran division familiar technology hurt part reason behind growth potential see one thing interesting phenomenon last couple year traditionally two three year ago case typical enterprise account largest line item would oﬃce case forever starting see sql server become largest line item deal reason sql grow amount data amount core process data whereas oﬃce sort capped number employee organization created interesting phenomenon hit attainment point also seeing large deal size growth look large deal classify 5 million sql revenue seeing growth last two year kind deal happening tier 1 customer looking sql buying combination factor described leading much larger deal size enterprise sale force starting take notice like ooh wait used used oﬃce big dog every account would spend energy sql thing showing suddenly bringing similar size deal okay need learn need drive combine market space data general interesting time ga launch sql 2014 recent impact sql server revenue growth 2q helped q4 calendar q2 certainly buy helped move customer q4 course biggest quarter see lot enterprise deal closing ga certainly helped deal size growth june sure satya talking also helped sale force could go account say look sql topic behind got customer board eron kelly karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead eron kellylet talk nosql sure huge topic interest everybody room seen private funding raise sure data stack mongo everybody unbelievable trying figure big threatening traditional relational database vendor oracle might know arguing interesting market threatening core relational database business stance nosql opportunity threat see opportunity fact three week ago announced new service microsoft azure called document db nosql database service reason see complement opportunity nosql database thing little bit differently different value prop traditional database one make sense make better sense situation versus others came three year ago within microsoft large cloud service challenge supporting traditional nosql database working scaling level consistency important say consistency pretty important distinction world typically nosql database read write quickly high performance always keep track absolute result consistent view transaction eventually reach consistency think facebook feed example look news feed always exactly accurate every time might someone post show maybe five minute later show right lack consistency inherent nosql database focused performance accuracy consistency difference eventual consistency transactional consistency correct looked problem said see value schemaless design database developer late game add new data solution without change original schema thought valuable saw value transaction speed built karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead eron kellynosql database would better meet need allows customer tune consistency felt like something pretty important data stored nosql database need transactional brought market see great complement envision let say site going commerce transaction traditional transactional database must always exactly right thing like comment rating review customer site live nosql database want really performing fast 100 accurate time two thing together think interesting ability really dial consistency dial brought table think unique think nosql interesting think great complement leveraging lot knowledge experience database world trying bring also see similar excitement around hadoop would think necessarily nosql database nosql data world realm committers committed hadoop think big part growth strategy well got go make sure good nosql side reason microsoft would le vulnerable nosql workload migration oracle guess would say le vulnerable mean price point help right oracle price point lot expensive going create financial pressure scenario good point think one think two azure nosql database also get mongo azure sort embracing choice option someone said hey want put table sql want put table mongo hey run azure either way seeing upside think approach know people fully internalized really embracing open source community azure allows u win window workload win linux workload within microsoft portfolio area think oracle really position karl kierstead eron kellythat good response let look hadoop another big trend going data space back microsoft started dancing hortonworks partnership think mistaken gone beyond hortonworks partnership term embracing hadoop different way microsoft embracing hadoop organization day maybe broad comment giving perspective hadoop enterprise adoption begin feel market sure yes hortonworks great partner started partnering three year ago goal really embrace hadoop growth time proprietary technology called dryad effectively thing looked market realized lot momentum around hadoop people learning try introduce complementary competitive thing make lot sense said let bet hadoop hortonworks great partner u regard brought hadoop microsoft part microsoft azure partnership hortonworks get call hd insight effectively hadoop platform service microsoft azure hortonworks hortonworks data platform hdp window server provide course also hdp linux committers microsoft developer actually check code hadoop project contributed lot ip hadoop additional project live top hadoop like hive stinger others rationale pattern seeing enterprise seeing hadoop great complement existing data warehouse brings new perspective customer talked progressive insurance also see yahoo originator hadoop huge hadoop cluster clickstream analysis go clickstream data go move data warehouse running sql server point bi tool analysis architecture hadoop next data warehouse access bi tool pretty common architecture kind pattern seeing hadoop really exciting course sentiment analysis iots internet thing big area focus got couple customer using one preview service azure around iot fascinating thing london underground looking vibration wheel escalator determine need replace wheel fails predictive analytics maintenance machine learning scenario interesting thing ph much embracing see great complement traditional business karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead eron kelly karl kiersteadokay actually got window server question okay think fair game throw sure lot trend talking move hadoop move nosql extent broader move public cloud azure talking aws others architecture include commodity x86 hardware generally run free paid linux window server wondering data architecture shift linux world window world manage transition make sure relevant architecture shift hardware world think seen u azure example run linux vm like run window vm run hadoop trying expand opportunity data management perspective workload also azure place see monetization value data warehouse bi tool rest stack want make easy possible get data help customer analyze thing like technology creates huge performance gain solution customer going want move valuable data anyway see nice complement let talk bi space part product management responsibility well like ask seeing bi space think seeing traditional bi reporting tool know eron kelly karl kierstead eron kellyﬂattish maybe growth feel like lot spending dollar still shifting next gen tool like tableau case powerview powerpivot etc seeing bi spending shift well perhaps nuanced shift seeing traditional bi side worth calling yes seeing big move toward bi would highlight visualization tool ease use become big move market think combination thing ceo c level want data make decision want employee data make decision static report fine good enough want able drill data see insight u investment powerpivot powerview part excel 2010 native 2013 example technology sql server team built provides excel team bring market big part bet power bi service mentioned earlier big part bet vision bring give employee organization access data make better decision think real value creation company historically focused employee productivity oﬃce suite window think microsoft yes much path going u visualization also new innovative thing make data interactive one great kind compelling feature power bi service feature call q literally allows ask question get answer back form data might ask say compare revenue growth sql server versus window server europe last year get graph back help better understand segmentation customer ask data question get answer back form graph data point really really think going take bi next level dashboard see graph chart someone maybe may created literally asking question kind investment able bring together engineer scientist microsoft research combined bi expert team even natural language folk bing create interesting technology think make market really grow karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead q unidentified participant eron kellydo think feature gap tableau today need close area visualization sure working hard close think area ahead like q example capability think familiarity user excel asset thing going certainly take advantage moving forward okay let see got question audience got five minute left yes right front actually want wait mic question answer yes thanks coming today question around guess highlighted hit little bit ability take share mean breadth offering guy enterprise much guy work together bundle different stuff oﬃce 365 sql server win business also help broad offering hybrid environment sure think power bi service example bundled sharepoint oﬃce sql subscription tangible example bringing together technology three different group three different product team create one offer think come overall oﬃce 365 say sql server really bundling make sense one core one user enterprise sale motion perspective enterprise agreement becoming something people want together mentioned historically oﬃce huge line item ea feedback mess oﬃce renewal really care little sql thing little bit okay care lot oﬃce renewal also interested growth get sql account team number becoming focused got program discounting thing like kind help really hard bundle looking karl kierstead q unidentified participant eron kelly karl kierstead q unidentified participant eron kellywe got question right yes thing going outside u sql server mean penetrated u market look like microsoft spread business generally basically look like microsoft spread trying think difference think really see great growth internationally well fun fun year end year year good year would get lot south africa place like saying reached significant financial milestone sql business end happening sql business internationally subsidiary much higher growth rate u le penetrated one two large deal global company smaller country know data need different global company u see sort growth pocket tend little bit migration tier 2 tier 1 see little bit might anomaly think general map microsoft yes right pricing question given value bring robustness offering ability desire close gap oracle moving yes good thing debated quite bit internally sql 2014 release want raise price technology going put box end said want maintain significant value advantage really focus share tier 1 pas move tier 1 mission critical app one platform onto another want price parity wanted real price advantage share share reason think made right decision created lot pressure tier 1 application space think good karl kierstead eron kelly karl kiersteadi think going get timed shortly eron one presentation part number broader data software innovation space recurring theme db event smack middle wish best luck keeping innovation growth sql server side thank attending today great well thank much karl appreciate attendance thank great
