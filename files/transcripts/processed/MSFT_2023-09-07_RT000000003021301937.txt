sorry thank first amy taking time today wanted double click azure little bit seeing come cloud optimization talked lot investment cycle done past decade transition seen evaluating come customer cohort geos evaluate like cycle long may last say question think get asked amy hood q analyst amy hoodhopefully one little different think become think new almost new language mean frankly great job explaining optimization sort part running workload always part running workload think thing really really really growing never talked mean seemed like normal part running business first would say anything particular would go cohorting geos industry cycle would back say customer optimize job platform provider help incent people help running workload eﬃciently get highest return every dollar spent important concept want money reinvested new workload course interest seeing ai great example right able make room budget get started newer maybe different workload list right tried work budget look say gosh microsoft particular think comp starting lap bigger optimization quarter almost people call make laugh little bit starting lap bigger one people think mean thing came lasted little bit people stopped customer get value continue focus reinvesting hopefully saving room budget back new workload think process focused making sure also process comp get little easier know everybody always focused exactly one number think probably say differently everybody welcome think way want right life way tend think described right normal part job make sure customer get value help reinvest great thing reinvestment obviously generative ai thinking magnitude implication might come inferencing training obviously azure going see impact azure also oﬃce 365 copilot touched q analyst amy hood q analyst amy hoodyes interesting general one important concept u time opposed maybe decade ago decade ago lot different business running infrastructure right taking sound antiquated took exchange made change online sharepoint made online platform right time around say thing noticed opportunity ineﬃciency right fungibility asset time sitting lot right fungible platform whether platform need used support third party supporting first party platform demand ability say oh gosh got copilot demand got platform demand azure openai service lends lot ﬂexibility whether inferencing workload maybe could training workload unique aspect general bigger point think u running business make sure fungible able meet customer demand exists way make sense u tend think people call call thing azure right azure fully sits every workload offer probably best way thinking far different decade ago think allows lot confidence term return invested capital shorter period time translate capex think incremental line yes like think like think incremental think something community really thinking much genai related much data center guy much broader footprint first started azure exactly right think people like oh gosh genai reality giant cloud business lot capital going support cloud business guess call funny term maintain replacement capital growth capital core investment coming support use term workload copilot azure openai service another piece would say would would right think related driving piece q kash rangan amy hood q kash rangan amy hood q kash rangan think investor feedback gpus ai gpus going ai buy gpus inherently expensive depreciate much quicker everybody math assimilating core azure certain capex profile certain profile tech stack go got massive eﬃciencies economy scale whereas new cycle getting concern well guess yes think way skill eﬃciencies gone azure side running business see thing happen ai platform side see software improvement see power improvement see investment optimizing large model see end lot eﬃciency growth think would say good way also thinking always ineﬃciencies seeing surge like take time plug thing time utilized pretty short whereas think say gosh well five year ago 10 year ago process mean time monetize time revenue pretty tight learning really heart question eﬃciencies picked prior cycle translatable although people look jump capex say well really ineﬃcient overcome learning think think thing talking contributing point two revenue ai started talking first time march like take like minor step back excitement seeing would argue quite good revenue growth product month market also think important realize ai workload require ai service right require data service require platform service whether excitement around fabric whether excitement around data work think announced recently see ai workload contribute core azure even ai revenue important concept partially additionally drive capital need right got investment data state prerequisite
