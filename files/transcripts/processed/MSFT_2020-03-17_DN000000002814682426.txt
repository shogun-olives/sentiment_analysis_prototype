everybody send question analyst take end without ado anand start semi hardware thank mandeep good morning everyone least like volatility senior analyst covering semi hardware spent extensive time conducting sensitivity scenario amid fast changing situation 17 company coverage drastically reduced sale eps scenario compared consensus hardly moved highlighting today also factored margin hit due reﬂected bi scenario certainly optimistic scenario certainly doom day one either reﬂects weak 1q 2q strength 3q sort 4q perspective think cloud public cloud specifically strongest area relative basis least impacted area due coronavirus corporate think already weak coming 2020 weaken estimate see hope auto unit company looking auto unit remain ﬂat 2020 sort minus 2019 think going occur handset good percent semi consumption remain mixed bag critical period 3q 4g 5g fight relative basis unit versus asp fight stronger asp average selling price 5g versus certainly en mass unit 4g background thought would address takeaway subsector level company level key number one point want make semi unequivocally much much better position hardware better exposure public cloud company like nvidia amd intel benefit given data center disproportionately tweaked towards public cloud corporate consider offset consumer pc side business well corporate think background perspective second half better first half remember cloud public cloud come back tends binge spending meant effect year one half sale greater two half sale least according intel think longer hold true think tend traditional year balance corporate cloud cloud inaudible utilization think sort slightly ignored topic company fan 2019 coming year 2020 going posit better volume going fill farm company posited stronger gross margin result better utilization better mix et cetera compared 2019 think view serious risk even small change sale relative last year relative estimate notable impact charge background thought share company two three company positing relative 10 20 u cover look ti example taken bi scenario suggested sale lower consensus 3 eps impact substantially higher percent little move part consensus number focused earnings power even company disproportionately exposed industrials auto ti think bigger impact relatively sector qualcomm story 4g 5g mix mentioned earlier dramatic impact 5g unit asp alone offset 4g unit impact iot and/or auto weakening inﬂuence dilutive effort eps lower substantially sale cut relative consensus amb price superior execution higher multiple exposed right area phenomenal execution relative intel high multiple name impact much believe might logistics issue rest industry want switch gear turn colleague woo jin ho cover smid semiconductor name woo jin ho anand srinivasanwoo jin anand thank much good morning everyone like anand said cover smid semiconductor name well networking similar exercise earnings small cap chip maker many audience may know impact virus continue evolve rapidly several company already qorvo skyworks microchip semi name average company cut estimate 4 6 first quarter update 2q given uncertainty let take closer look embedded 1q cut say may already outdated given happened last couple day included one supply chain disruption china two lower demand china stable stable demand u europe needle say already outdated given global disruption take took stab estimate scenario late last week small mid cap semi company modestly took 2q estimate recent consensus cut made modest cut 2h broadly speaking assumption business environment stabilizing 2q yielded 5 drop sale consensus expectation versus consensus expectation 10 drop eps versus expectation assumption like anand said also included modest reduction gross margin opex given event past couple day breadth scope virus impact still risk 2q come 5 drop looking well 10 drop eps looking think consensus yet caught think second half recovery may weaker anticipated mind given uncertainty take look strength balance sheet small mid cap chip maker within coverage universe company fair amount free cash ﬂow generation company manageable balance sheet low leverage ratio company skyworks maxim xilinx qorvo cash rich debt leverage ratio although 1 time 2 time ebitda free cash margin 30 company little impact see little impact servicing debt paying dividend going pas back anand discus hardware thank woo jin hardware slightly different scenario semiconductor particularly focused earnings power multiple believe hardware sector oem space dramatically poorly positioned semiconductor multiple reason woo jin honumber one focus earnings multiple hpe dell time hpq time dell netapp 9 time cisco 10 time appear low versus historical level believe earnings substantial risk semiconductor sector sale revision low 2020 even 2021 taken look giggle consensus think notable cut potentially come think earnings set structurally decline think corporate spending weak coming 2020 hardware oem perspective look several business hpe lenovo netapp dell structural weakness think continue even think amplify structural weakness company little place hide given de minimis public cloud exposure using background thought share sort hpe scenario look revenue card taken 2 relative 2 lower consensus taken notably look eps perspective substantially lower consensus 17 think also scope imminent recovery short term example want turn back woo jin discus cisco woo jin sure thanks anand couple thing want discus high level view want start networking networking company little china sale exposure

lost revenue 700 million 800 million ebit monthly level universal park two u one japan roughly bring 16 million 17 million revenue daily basis 6 million daily ebitda kind impact gauged far moving advertising really challenged sector kind changing dramatically lot going depend whether believe trigger recession course advertising going hurt badly going obviously situation extremely ﬂuid actually going go magna global projection actually little bit analysis last week last week actually still projecting 2 3 increase core u advertising excludes political olympics event remember percentage increase factor recession problem travel tourism retail restaurant movie hit badly rebound going extremely challenging think estimate going come political might one bright spot projected record year political advertising close almost 3.5 billion pretty much intact far olympics canceled going 1 billion 1.5 billion lost term advertising revenue course severe plunge tv rating nbc network moving

10 15 time big winner term quarantine actually going streaming ideal bench viewing term advertising really help connected tv advertising already seen sector really rise year virus expectation connected advertising jump 27 expect acceleration 10 13 nearly 40 versus initial estimate lastly term touching cable sector cable operator term think pretty defensive thanks mainly heavy broadband exposure make le sensitive competitor virus well potential economic downturn going work level term impact going next day please stay tuned going pas colleague mandeep singh thank geetha reminder everyone please send question option webinar send question take towards end thank think one thing going see obviously company larger consumer exposure hit hard surprising given implication travel want touch estimate view sector headed far seen 11 12 decline estimate beginning year online travel guy view 2q could lot worse think consensus way behind curve term taking estimate online travel guy well ride sharing company reason say number cancellation taken place last two week three week view going see pronounced impact 2q think could much 50 booking notable europe exposure thing huge decline seeing demand going see short snapback happens likely wo happen 4q view time company like booking solid balance sheet could really weather much better online travel guy namely expedia tripadvisor definitely think booking pretty strong balance sheet lot estimate cut already reﬂected valuation booking still trade premium relative expedia think premium warranted julie charielland point time think europe big headwind booking travel ban lifted see sharp snapback 2q pretty much done deal think consensus way behind going see sharp cut estimate 2q overall think strong demand quickly ride sharing side think trip frequency big driver revenue ride sharing guy seeing given isolation everything seeing pronounced decline come trip frequency provider implication demand side well supply side ride sharing guy consensus behind curve ride sharing guy still expecting 20 growth full year think first half probably going digit best going see company push especially think lyft well uber push profitability target least couple quarter quickly mention uber somewhat better positioned lyft food delivery seeing see say people staying home think food delivery able offset whatever headwind uber seeing ride sharing side good thing uber option would suggest everybody take look know number shaping seatrip.com thing snap back booking expedia thing meituan china thing shape food delivery guy china obviously three month four month ahead recovery likely sooner best look metric company get sense going play u really quickly valuation risk think valuation risk low point ride sharing food delivery guy given valuation come quite bit really think key indicator trip frequency see bounce back trip frequency think good company pas julie payment thanks mandeep yeah hi julie chariell ran scenario fintech payment company may impacted slowdown spending walk methodology shortly let first give key takeaway first discretionary spending clearly heading way lead slower tpv revenue growth first half likely slower eps growth mean hard cut cost meaningfully downturn seems likely depending company group geographic business mix revenue growth could slow 4 point 14 point year eps could drop 2 to.9 second think merchant acquirer like global payment fiserv well square could high end negative range seems bit like lot consensus call global payment fiserv nearly revenue tied merchant card processing discretionary spending card likely start slowing across board right moving beyond ﬂights hotel cruise kind entertainment sporting event theater restaurant retail yet reﬂected guidance management commentary ability work home pretty amazing advance doubt best way extract integration synergy mega merger stay plan importantly week ago good company little exposure asia think going turn negative 2q region lone grower asia particularly china seems least past worst coronavirus outbreak people factory starting get back work conversely shutdown started europe u obviously coronavirus case yet reached peak possible asia rebound could mitigating factor earnings pressure visa mastercard nearly 30 revenue asia third stock continue fall earnings estimate reasonably adjusted downward far weighted average reduction 2020 eps coverage universe 1.5 see share loss single digit range estimate come bear market sentiment really prevails start seeing greater multiple contraction even factoring second half recovery 2021 growth stock price decline reach high teen lastly think paypal maybe best relative performer business already impacted company announced small growth shortfall expect get worse 25 revenue social distancing seems even people buying online merchant paypal core customer base long product remains available delivery continue paypal merchant customer maybe busiest far let show assumption behind number three scenario first two deal fundamental focused tpv region impact discretionary portion tpv tpv total payment volume total amount spent card digital mean base case seemed like worst case week ago may light assumes 20 30 tpv decline couple month scenario two assumes deeper decline longer 50 decline discretionary spending card assume last june u europe third scenario worst case look market slipping extended bear territory possibly prolonged impact lack optimism swift substantial rebound assumes multiple compression lower 2021 eps specific described slide wo restate impact stock would tough 13 20 decline jitendra warallet show impact assumption number see along left side split coverage four segment card processor large merchant acquirer merged six company three company last year see term revenue growth slowdown eps decline global payment fiserv downside risk along square reason discussed earlier interesting fidelity national fis le impacted half exposure merchant card processing card network visa mastercard similar tpv risk processor could also see card issuing service revenue slowdown bank derisking kind scenario impact could muted scale global reach includes exposure asia seems mend wex fleetcor 20 30 business tied corporate travel expensing know practically grounded halt estimate already come average larger exposure trucking may actually supported rise logistics need lower fuel price though could add top line pressure lastly pure fintechs square paypal square small merchant base comprised many restaurant could hit hardest long downturn virtually exposure asia potential growth leg 2q paypal see lowest potential growth eps impact right impact confined around 25 business supporting payment company look relatively well insulated lastly valuation look company potential stock impact really lower eps multiple hold downside mostly contained percentage highest highest number processor lowest paypal bear market sentiment take hold broader market multiple begin contract even investor looking toward normalized 2021 share face another big drop going hand colleague jitendra waral internet thank julie good morning everybody jitendra waral cover internet sector uncertainty space high fact sheryl sandberg coo facebook yesterday bloomberg tv said nobody predict marketing impact point term extent impact take cue happened china exactly sort like mean internet space general positive negative first touch advertising sector widespread impact vertical everybody talked expectation internet changed sort reﬂects visibility problem china internet space seen decline 1q expectation expect similar thing happen 2q u name multiple three basic way impact really come number one travel travel hard hit hardest hit sector 8 industry general exposure varies company google higher exposure search 11 display would reﬂect facebook 6 travel seeing company taking spending 25 plus travel segment would ripple impact company aspect really captured expectation valuation matter impact automotive financial service 12 industry sale sort add three vertical 30 plus exposure ad revenue coming large internet company would show essentially second quarter company reporting give u guidance ad growth slowdown 1h going bigger impact estimate facebook going upwards 2 billion google going 3 billion continues potentially part 2h advertising coming back online different sector different pace given three vertical might move slowly back expect like impact sort continue 3q hope rightful step company taking minimize impact second half could taper hit near end aspect advertising important event cancellation particular important twitter twitter become largely company recent year key event like olympics risk would significant impact twitter revenue growth expectation biggest unknown really internet sector advertising general google facebook remains small medium business small medium business pretty much lifeblood company term growth closure seeing right raise uncertainty impact could think like looking chinese internet company based face closure could give u idea believe decline going happen second quarter one interesting demand spiking across board seeing amazon apps general sort like get higher demand amazon hiring 100,000 people service demand help revenue growth offset may demand people working home trying shore capacity different time really cost logistics go historically seen capacity overwhelmed cost go amazon raising compensation current workforce rightfully cost 350 million incremental hiring 100,000 people support spike demand may also come additional cost believe happening year look amazon business general everything excluding aws anurag ranaexpected operating margin 2.2 pretty much ﬂat 2019 believe number hit might actually come close 0 scenario one positive see sector really cloud utilization sensitive measure cloud work home drive usage across board going see margin uptick amazon said early 2019 every single percentage point increase utilization lead ten million dollar saving would see higher utilization work home online engagement actually benefit sort create offset internet company exposed trend cloud perspective valuation valuation actually dipped 2015 level feel sum total seeing decline expectation first half digit whole year look valuation reﬂecting sharp decline 2015 low perspective really capture recession scenario one reference point give google google growth slowed 2009 happened uncertain unknown thing second half would sort dip double digit know company strongest balance sheet world 70 world online population using service every month getting exposed new feature use case like whatsapp business grocery whole food verily google secular tailwind driving growth internet sector expect pause wo stop longer term expect weather storm growth curve internet sector resume next year hopefully give perspective internet sector pas anurag rana view software thank jitendira perspective bit different seen sector largely least near term going virus going le impact stuff already booked especially company large support revenue large subscription base typically happens revenue already book matter ﬂowed income statement far virus concerned impact see going area deal cycle elongated new product sale far could say expectation going next month could okay may bad saw case oracle actually slightly better people expected bigger kicker would could see new product sale suffer would reﬂect case license sale well new cloud sale two area think going see first sign slowdown case company could see impact revenue performance obligation number number ﬂows revenue next 12 month 24 month one area think could see kind could say boost going demand boost collaboration software talk slack talk microsoft team sure everybody talked ad nauseam zoom number downloads gone end day software industry providing productivity tool consumer enterprise think could drive growth going coming particular problem short term think think company provide collaboration software could see leg want brieﬂy discus valuation looked valuation come compared last four year five year frankly moved area going back level jump service world wanted take minute go bigger name cover see think going fare next couple quarter starting microsoft example looking microsoft fairly sizable let say stable commercial base think annuity commercial base closer 80 90 company sign enterprise sign agreement microsoft provide microsoft provide product microsoft fairly stable commercial business consumer business one could see weakness area could see case one segment called pc area could see hardware sale problem similar anand said supply chain concern microsoft already pulled guidance division think see impact going area cloud business transactional part think able hold utilizing application would see lot transaction go stable nature subscription provided oﬃce 365 stable element second big company oracle reported thing looked okay fact reported better number people expected case oracle large support base big issue behind cloud able migrate lot database guess silver lining also provided large support base get recurring revenue actually holding right subscription base fusion cloud product also holding moving sap company think high europe exposure could think one software company could see downside sale eps revision going next quarter even high exposure europe well also run product called ariba fair amount transaction revenue ﬂows le subscription nature moving vmware company see weakness license sale support base largely large virtualization software able offset risk salesforce.com company also done fair amount good work would say stable subscription nature acquired couple company last two year think help mitigate organic slowdown new business signing also encounter given diverse product portfolio think le insulated single product company brings u workday workday bit issue come core hcm product slowing biggest hope next future growth pinned erp solution area think possibly given big commitment company given disruption going maybe take bit back seat near future said think workday prospect coming also one company superior product area service last two company software cover shopify adobe fairly hard fairly large exposure product one could see either could say spending moving onto service think area going le impact nevertheless see stuff well within tech service name think consulting one get affected outsourcing largely discretionary nature consulting work get impacted company larger european exposure capgemini one impacted given bank spend lot service given happening interest rate last week think bank spending likely going get weaker next 12 month even offshore work immune slowdown offshore company cognizant tc infosys depend lot banking spending could see slowdown growth rate one thing remember almost service company going year typically 90 revenue already locked think still better protected company tech ecosystem u area would watching closely would booking number going next quarter see come within service space think accenture one company much would say well diversified business model see last last time looked accenture going back could see revenue fell quite bit think different company point le impact individual company business model unique way acquiring small entity scaling large digital footprint large global offshore footprint think would comparative basis le impact accenture would rest space john butlernow going pas along colleague john butler telecom technical diﬃculty cover telecom equipment vendor see first chart consensus revenue estimate eps sector really come lot think lot reﬂects fact telecom relatively immune really sizable impact virus said let start apple provide thought think going play think number one important thing keep mind apple lost sale second quarter third quarter going lost forever majority apple device business really represents upgrade opposed organic growth sense see pushouts maybe fourth quarter even next year lost sale lost forever running base case scenario total impact quarter next fiscal second third quarter apple base case scenario suggests 0.50 impact eps roughly 7 billion 10 billion likely mostly postponed sale opposed lost sale big issue quarter centered china impacted demand also supply shock good news rate new infection china beginning recede bad news demand impact evolving western market particularly europe u best guess probably going follow similar bell curve china think sudden change behavior state western europe social distancing advent warmer weather come starting may really going help quell spread think largely confine 2q 3q shifting look impacted apple valuation many know apple 25 high look back early january stock trading 24 time forward four quarter pe ratio chart suggests headed back mean 15 time 16 time sort driven trading environment diﬃcult say whether overshoot think concern really getting baked almost scenario state switching gear telecom think title say telecom relatively immune virus impact overall expect quarantining forth maybe 2 impact annual sale carrier good news service revenue really benefit trend equipment sale could get dented carrier beginning close retail store particularly store going much lower foot traﬃc though would emphasize equipment sale lower margin service business pardon represent much smaller percent total revenue q mandeep singh q julie chariellone question get lot virus really derail deployment 5g service u think best answer maybe could see potential labor shortage get broad outbreak state already shortage tower climber call folk climb tower put spectrum service equipment service cell tower think boost sick leave among labor force could lead shortage worker course risk equipment shortage well expectation risk modest impact think get second half back full steam ahead taking look telecom valuation see come market term business insulated virus telecom along utility good get really service based revenue model let sort close portion discussion quick thought wireless equipment vendor including nokia ericsson coming quarter faced supply risk china getting critical component make gear bit demand side risk much smaller comparison ericsson also faced much higher risk china nokia bigger business think good news point rate new infection china dropping rapidly getting back business think supply constraint begin ease coming month opposed get worse happen equipment sale may get dented new network construction u europe slows lot sick leave among workforce mind modeled base case scenario 5 risk revenue overall think fallout two name modest good news lot factory getting back work getting back work china let turn back mandeep q question answer thank john may time couple question julie talk payment exposure top company like visa mastercard sure thanks mandeep visa mastercard provide specific amount revenue tpv transaction best estimate seen somewhere 5 7 provide growth though every quarter tell visa past year grown slightly lower q mandeep singh q geetha ranganathan q mandeep singh q anand srinivasanthan corporate average mastercard grown slightly higher visit could accrue bit mastercard visa thing slow still seems well le 10 tpv got thank julie geetha really quick discus subscriber growth tailwind streaming company like netﬂix hulu disney result sure mandeep obviously big boost streaming service ran number people get shut obviously streaming actually ran number february mobile downloads asia region netﬂix saw 30 increase expect similar increase u march thing though even subscriber tailwind couple thing need factor debate really company like netﬂix instance really like buffet even people spending like four hour netﬂix necessarily ad revenue translate significant increase revenue probably think people want go simultaneous streaming probably going upgrade expensive tier probably benefit service think netﬂix best position breadth depth content mean sheer tonnage content steady stream new content landing time kind put advantage especially coronavirus kind postponed production lot newer streaming service disney plus instance high profile original like marvel falcon winter soldier kind put hold netﬂix actually shut film tv production still lot pipeline good show bringing service thank geetha anand get last one talk best worst case scenario long impact last supply chain guy thank mandeep ev side best case scenario return 90 utilization next month particularly china seen hon hai assembler well fabs semiconductor factory actually mostly located outside china korea taiwan lesser degree japan u singapore factory higher utilization well supply chain assembly gear may want see return 90 sort threshold number well ahead q3 calendar q3 happens may fantastic april better q mandeep singhthe worst case scenario return 90 number 2q 3q happens quarter semiconductor assembler actually 3q period ahead 4q production assembly gear late 2q even early 2q lose potentially 30 35 year worth sale one quarter would destroy 2020 estimate would put u worst case scenario hopefully give color regarding supply chain got thank anand think webinar come close behalf tmt team thank joining today hope useful reach respective analyst see slide question send replay slide email hope situation soon everyone stay safe healthy thank
