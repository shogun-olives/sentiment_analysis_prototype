well thank everybody joining day three ubs tech conference probably excited lineup software company day three microsoft obviously mongodb zoom informatica datastax docusign afternoon really high quality lineup software company would say led relatively large market cap company seattle area corey thanks joining u everybody listening question like technical diï¬ƒculty direct corey question bar front welcome use see prefer reach directly email curate pepper corey investor question towards end corey welcome maybe want take minute describe role microsoft met yet yeah absolutely thanks karl thank much explain action current role also maybe explain previous role give little bit framing actually changed role last couple week current role team called microsoft cloud industry global expansion team engineering side report scott guthrie accountable sort delivery industry solution partnership global expansion deployment around world like said enrolled couple week answer best regard previous three year reported judson althoff chief commercial oï¬ƒcer chief revenue oï¬ƒcer excuse responsible sort strategy technical delivery solution area azure dynamic good sort amount experience area prior actually engineering q karl keirstead corey sander q karl keirstead corey sander q karl keirstead corey sanderswell building original azure vm compute stack little bit place microsoft excited question answer question answer make interesting everybody corey yes exactly maybe interesting obviously everybody scott team need session red polo glad got exception right actually think allowed wear red polo confusing anyone scott wear red polo banned right corey maybe dive azure individual product area microsoft let kind keep little higher level little bit ask broadly seeing spending environment sort spirit question something tech investor trying grapple especially look new year pick right stock understand trend might terrific last 18 month post covid maybe mix shifting priority changing next 18 month obviously important everybody get right stock portfolio maybe start think spending priority changing yeah think seen last month maybe even year particularly accelerated unfortunate output pandemic seen big focus push towards digital transformation every front right think particular focus cloud enable type digital transformation includes certainly productivity change productivity sort conversation right remember done three year ago everyone conference room change sort approach productivity engage work inside outside company fundamentally changed fundamental dependency cloud q karl keirstead corey sandersand beginning right think seen push towards aspect digital transformation sort spawning right way people work way people engage change way people buy way people want use service experience way people want build solution even even concept building new technology fundamentally changed see sort digital transformation accelerated incredible rate across sort company involves right think exciting unfortunate time period think expansion really something focus think look sort microsoft context think one thing part customer looking sort expansion digital transformation understanding component come together right think talk customer conversation microsoft cloud also really sort accelerated last two year right one conversation productivity one conversation infrastructure one conversation business apps conversation around product come together whether software often time software partner solution intermix mentioned partner folk talking even session actually think another big change dynamic seeing sort solution come together deliver outcome going key focal point u customer part corey within various project part digital transformation judgment made immediate priority month pandemic hit might lifecycle sort leveling conversely priority put hold kind hit hard month day sun finally getting funded yeah think probably two part answer think part one really dependent upon customer business right like could mean sort new industry role exciting different retail obviously anyone retail vibrant online opportunity purchasing engaging support immediate critical need figure right whereas may find element let say financial service maybe le immediate sort need completely rework selling product right difference could much dependent upon customer business think obvious one collaboration technology would say security really popped sort q karl keirstead corey sandersimmediate requirement think across entire landscape right fact everyone working home need make sure collaboration capability work tooling worked security model able deliver upon experience immediate would say immediate spike would say necessarily leveling way expectation changing right remember first six month could get meeting together worked right much conversation want meeting want able transact work understand data look one single screen expectation mean work collaboratively continuing go right think spike think sort increased focus thing got delayed absolutely thing centric lot starting come back use retail example well frontline worker right sort focus frontline worker experience store closed maybe could put little bit sort lot retail back open sort priority actually reaccelerated big area focus yeah think little bit industry really specific think big spike even big spike think sort uncertainty pandemic thing `` go back normal even original normal think expectation collaborative work increasing everyone expecting let go back maybe point made earlier response question mentioned fact partner lot company mentioned fireside chat today maybe broader question spending change changing microsoft partner ecosystem making shift team front yeah absolutely think big focus look sort partner ecosystem opportunity actually somewhat true even customer conversation shifting selling product actually going building together building solution look exciting partner announcement believe coming example inaudible oil gas say amadeus travel blackrock hosting aladdin service azure experience bringing resource engineering team work together expert field able basically take expertise thing like collaborative application thing like infrastructure expertise data ai bring expertise folk know oil gas better u know financial service better u know element better u q karl keirstead corey sander q karl keirstead corey sandersand type partnership u basically big shift u one fact really excited new job really magic happens bringing expertise two side bring together example even recent kyndryl announcement bring sort strong expertise industry market capability horizontal service sort bringing life definitely changing changed lot continue see opportunity work partner got okay good perspective let maybe use jumping point individual revenue segment within microsoft maybe talk one everybody want talk azure congrats way amazing success sound like got start microsoft career engineer azure vm side turned pretty big business congrats team thank wanted ask couple specific question azure one tough one u outside figure model conversion big azure commitment actually usage therefore azure rev guess supposition probably take time sign contract today probably really see usage sweet spot usage curve maybe another 12 18 month love ask corey perspective process work everybody listening sharper job trying model azure revenue going forward yeah guess short answer point complex right think complex actually much tied customer goal expectation point even sort previous discussion prioritization right mean go range anywhere sign deal get data center year lease incented heavily move quickly data center may element transforming business inventing new business model going take time build even scale right may start small one region grow every big customer every big deal typically set type engagement sort add consumption cloud hard model frankly envy point maybe add hopefully helpful one look going back previous point general urgency customer q karl keirstead corey sandersthere urgency passion around making change seen since azure 15 year ago moved azure team original product line energy around moving high see lot passion around going quickly one something signed sometimes even starting signed right mean ability consumption service start month sign move forward type deal thing side say take time like said bigger investment continue make sort two element one resource bring customer right bring sort engineering resource called cloud solution architect customer immediately upon signing sometimes signing single dollar consumption spent work customer step need take pretty involved right need look reliability need look security need look cost going work need look operation right team typically need educated learning skilling framework built called well architected framework continually improve really focused customer getting get value wanted get sign contract fast possible work shifting left like say getting customer deploying fast possible always take time always people technology effort need made get full advantage guess people element might constraint day hot topic street medium fact labor shortage bid engineer day seeing example corey sort struggle talent lack people constraining ability microsoft large customer ramp use azure fast like reached acute level yet yeah would say least experience think workforce shortage impact say true think since cloud started think skilling area acute attention u mean area invest significant amount money go help customer skill going different going feel different experience le sort people around making sure helping people take full advantage understand learn look sure everyone call appreciates fast moving market kind point right lot new technology coming time really invested customer make sure keeping best interest best interest q karl keirstead corey sander q karl keirstead got corey another part azure story tough u outside get get handle mix service look like azure think everybody impression customer board probably pretty heavy use azurevm compute storage called core infrastructure become mature azure user graduate premium service really good sense mix look like within premium service popular bigger bucket opine little bit yeah absolutely think maybe two point say one experience least le sort maturity curve customer need right kind even come back previous large customer work two part customer working simultaneously one need close data center get onto vmware service azure quickly possible going stay right get done got get lease right parallel talking manufacturing line leverage iot data modernize enable able use ai predict outcome manufacturing line exact time company maturity position different conversation based need right think big element customer need pushing market right think least one keep component le nine month customer move iaa paas actually like even within customer workload 100 paas day one workload iaa never moved paas also make think mix hard predict ca sort see curve right way per customer said specific area think ai multiple speaker absolutely data ai really sort one seen sort gigantic shift focus customer think realization sort digital transformation push start conversation got lot data really know supposed conversation around sort getting data cloud enabling sort modern analytics based solution enabling ai based predictive capability almost always part digital transformation discussion right matter whether retail customer information whether oil gas seismic information whether manufacturing iot based information data strategy part discussion really big area focus attention force maybe let hit right actually hot topic tech investor corey sander q karl keirstead corey sander q karl keirstead corey sander q karl keirstead corey sander yeah good even today mongodb informatica fireside chat yesterday fireside ceo ali data brick day mike scarpelli snowï¬‚ake think know folk actually many case product live azure sure case think mentioned service azure yes seem fairly well pretty clear everybody super interesting happening around data ai space maybe ask weigh little bit microsoft product compete vendor one hand partner largely want run azure hand going sit back sort seed market vendor merely collect compute resource consumption going chase opportunity compete actually partner big opportunity corey yeah mean going sound maybe little bit repetitive start customer right making sure delivering capability customer want need right mentioned sort product mentioned product could argue compete compete element right discussion opportunity support customer path want go experience love snowï¬‚ake enabling snowï¬‚ake enabling power bi right enabling sort team collaboration power bi supporting customer part journey great outcome u customer snowï¬‚ake right certainly going continue partnership make sure service run great infrastructure integration across entire stack data ai giant surface area even product mentioned even subset right surface area customer trying compliance analytics spark operational data right complex broad surface area q karl keirstead corey sander q karl keirsteadand real strength come able offer solution across entire surface area able offer integration third party customer would prefer able offer great first party solution prefer buy u already using service solution right think way kind kind complex answer coming back reality customer environment right may reason may passion one service think story really strength willingness partner across one customer partner excuse love hear whether partner said thing u maybe take privately maybe couple azure taking back corey early microsoft day helping build azure vm suite think asked average tech investor today would argue little differentiate compute resource rented speak azure versus aws ec2 versus google cloud compute part team actually built azure vm suite guess would probably disagree notion maybe love ask actually different azure core compute side yeah think absolutely differentiation core compute think certainly element probably argue would commoditized frankly would probably service element commoditized element differentiated place think offer really unique value see lot interest sort specific component core compute actually gpu capability vm interconnect capability like seen growth sort data ai story mentioned one element able run complex ai solution ai stack band sort really self service super easy deploy cognitive service way really computing super custom requirement seen customer requirement part story course dependent upon right gpus right vm interconnect right connectivity infiniband based connectivity continued big differentiator u market see really big positive see sort opportunity hpc ai based solution one could go surrounding storage performance different tier storage capability sort ease use actually think networking ease use becoming really important differentiator part stack easy leverage networking use hybrid environment something see time actually particularly bank work sort networking complex getting right simple big differentiator would argue deep infrastructure corey sander q karl keirstead corey sander q karl keirstead corey sandersthat good yeah maybe one thing add super fast course bigger point differentiation fact point also find people make decision infrastructure right everything talked right want hpc aivm running different cloud data service want data service cloud insight experience cloud collaboration experience seeing like u least microsoft cloud differentiator way vms going go also element would probably add conversation answer long hopefully helpful okay going ask one azure question okay listen april brett disclose azure gross margin discussed improved time one source improvement eï¬ƒciency gain inside azure one guy sleeve rolled weed give everybody listening example eï¬ƒciency gain still left azure might sort squeeze little bit margin server seems impossible squeezed lemon maximum yet kind left might eï¬ƒciency gain maybe give u one example corey yeah mean look think like sort innovation space always going opportunity innovating area right mean certainly sort scale magnitude sort amount eï¬ƒciency gained may sort vary time always opportunity gain part work provider right think sort work improvement happening chip level memory level sort networking level element come together using resource optimal way even ai based understanding customer usage right way making sure making decision based optimizing either power consumption placement protocol going result u saving money ongoing effort effort requires constant innovation work think exciting effort right think especially people deep stack fun place given scale working joke always q karl keirstead corey sandersmake take big change big impact something think effort planning twice year margin big component decision make around feature taking work putting place apply bottom line quite literally yeah super helpful let leave azure moment talk another exciting product area team cory everybody listen trying figure number variable collaboration huge priority even said earlier look next 18 month fade little bit ï¬‚attened one thing trying figure trying figure microsoft team versus zoom versus webex versus salesforce slack competitive environment going play maybe could set framework u view usage adoption team changing see next year two yeah probably area worth touching upon sort like already said growth sort expansion team usage last two year somewhat mean think super exciting see sort watch even going back previous role since run azure vms right like whole company behind right exciting place u think sort latest number nearly 250 million q4 fy21 sort question sort okay great big number go right think probably area one still opportunity grow user base right one thing already even mentioned frontline worker ability sort think enabling use retail right shift enabling usage bringing capability team experience literally every employee company use use right love right work need happen tie back industry charter work right different requirement someone working oil rig someone working local store got work requirement deliver upon independently opportunity base think could grow think also lot opportunity u increase value resultantly increase revenue per user right thing even already talked collaborative application right enabling partner already talked collaborative experience team environment enabling team integrate additional service like voice right contact center right enabling sudden capability really shine part team experience q karl keirstead corey sander q karl keirstead corey sandersand perhaps area think really important continue expand trust security story come team across entire platform big reason people choose team believe trust offering believe support think really good opportunity u continue add value course continue gain revenue part people buying new service got let hit recent team announcement last week think announced team essential clearly targeted downstream small midsize business stated price point 4 per user per month describe strategy hosting zoom couple hour earlier corey certainly ask thought essential love ask thought watched yeah maybe tell oï¬ „ ine look think mentioned little bit expanding base look sort team essential think another opportunity small business different right requirement different need different think team essential see big opportunity company 25 employee le right looking sort meeting capability aspect data expect microsoft around sort trust yet ready purchase broader o365 mp65 suite capability sort team standalone think quite appealing able offer platform smaller business customer enable lot point mentioned around sort expanding collaboration change may want make business offering platform offering meeting experience really great opportunity u think offer lot value market looking value right look corey would robut view microsoft taking team least customer segment 3 4 per user per month difference product essential actually version would otherwise get free correct right mean quite bit value group video call 30 hour group chat right even calendaring like capability well beyond call one person talk right mean concept focused small business need small business need person person phone call right really strategy would rebuttal told call q karl keirstead corey sander q karl keirstead let talk oï¬ƒce obviously one franchise inside microsoft portfolio bigger news microsoft elected march 1st raise price point across important skus maybe could help frame think right time microsoft make move corey interfacing customer like reaction price increase little bit pushback shoulder shrug happening term reaction yeah price increase share little bit background actually increased oï¬ƒce 365 price since june 2011 right pretty astounding time period yet time period last four year since microsoft 365 added 24 like distinct full apps including team power apps power bi power automate always deep conversation adding value price point match value adding constant conversation decision point need met course primary goal getting right value customer making sure right competitive price point kind background least change sort think timing change broader customer perspective want careful speaking holistically every customer world customer work conversation much broader one seat pricing right even coming back previous discussion conversation always full microsoft cloud element dynamic element power apps element m365 element azure element data conversation really around outcome customer getting total roi type outcome like saying price important customer price conversation much le line item line item much paying microsoft roi going get conversation sort blip right conversation much bigger much broader want careful saying mean customer going want conversation want realistic least conversation always bigger broader much total roi conversation line item price item got perfect probably got five minute let take couple question one came corey read back reference think customer anecdote made wanting get data center move vmware azure question would customer lift shift onto vmware azure without actually rewriting underlying code data take advantage cloud offer corey sander q karl keirstead corey sander yeah mean actually going back know four question ago five question ago mean primary reason skill set dependent tooling mean customer always hard make generalized statement customer built really extensive toolset dependency chain product like vmware right partnership vmware fantastic vmware offer lot modernization capability top container based solution want careful say vmware modern solution like offering capability top modernize way customer dependency customer dependency look service capability really sort customer starting point skill set comfortable built environment going dictate first step take partnership critical helping customer journey whatever starting point starting point often time going different partner different place vmware fantastic partner regard offering modernization also offering really fast lift shift capability customer deeply invested vmware many customer exactly okay maybe finish another question subject hit sort core window franchise spirit question microsoft done great job last five ten year taking lot traditional business essentially moving cloud moving traditional license maintenance model one radical subscription large portion core window business still sort window oem upfront license sale curious microsoft try take window business cloud radical subscription era two thing noticed recently seemed effort would azure virtual desktop way marry window azure think microsoft recently launched cloud pc product might effect touch traction seeing far product might disrupting yeah combination two product actually pretty exciting set solution offer especially given even think question one digital transformation movement security trust sort central point created lot demand desktop right able run desktop cloud able leverage create zero trust environment local machine right found many many customer built dependency around expectation integrates collaboration capability like team like oï¬ƒce365 et cetera q karl keirstead corey sandersand big shift think pandemic actually one sort big spike question seen pandemic get employee virtual environment cloud desktop create zero trust opportunity excuse hub sort solution really offer combination two offer full range even sort taking previous question applying window 365 offer really actually exciting new way run sort window experience including apps data setting sort automated managed cloud right fantastic way truly get experience natively cloud virtual desktop one seen huge amount traction excitement around particularly around strong partnership citrix vmware offering solution natively cloud experience customer use love want grow top allows able deploy experience directly azure infrastructure scalable expectation range give customer choice allows customer pick accelerates movement digital motion offering sort window based experience fully scalable way corey could talk another hour unfortunately got cut sure got day job need get back anyway sooner later yeah exactly thanks carving time u thanks april brett enabling corey attend conference tell microsoft story ubs client thank happy holiday thanks lot
