partner digital investment sure technology facing partner store absolutely going happen matter always look pay benefit determine think right time switching channel development interesting one reason consensus entirely brought guidance gave analyst day growing revenue 60 operating profit maybe 100 2014 2019 500 million incremental operating profit period consensus talk second opportunity growth come et cetera within segment dig little bit two big growth opportunity channel development next five year maybe talk category significant today roast ground packaged coffee grocery aisle wherever want buy category broadly declining pretty steadily entire industry number year shifting single serve able category declined hold slightly grow little bit share feel pretty good packaged coffee still significant revenue source u future great thing think happy declining category fold growth share bit drive profitability shift single serve something everyone seen participating big way leading share single serve last quarter number one kind switch back forth u number one number two player obviously premium price point aisle keith stegnerso last year actually relatively short period time mike conway run channel development business built leading position premium price point aisle feel pretty good something continue today continue see growth channel development driven primarily broadening sku selection working green mountain make sure plenty place add thing like cinnamon dolce add thing like single origin first time relationship green mountain never better able continue get allocation additional skus continue get manufacturing allocation need driven ton growth profitability think continues think sitting going well maybe got couple skus add thing going ï¬‚atten think continue drive growth next year going come online next two three year significantly today increase far contribution total profit growth international particularly probably early opportunity 21 country something think lot people understand japan korea share north america partnership pepsi look outside u know deal need recipe capability make locally relevant know brand reinforced store presence country need right partner production delivery standpoint distribution midst talk country try add particularly asia pac country like china think significant opportunity business overall percentage total profitability today smaller see significant growth thing come online get two three year look growth profitability mix start become meaningful part along single serve look top line lot revenue come jv partnership royalty like pepsi bottom line grows little bit faster top line come revenue come jv income actually brought question audience one talk keurig partnership room grow internationally scott

store 1,000 store japan look revenue line item country world 100 thing starbuck store unit count growth maybe go little bit faster jv partner also store around limited time offer thing think drive comp think important point japan comping starbuck store 4 year average last three year consistent every quarter move around take last three year pretty big number japan economy ï¬‚attish retail environment keith stegner scott maw keith stegner scott mawtough feel good think lean maybe either bit real opportunity japan channel really small way licensed store got nice little business expand really food service business oï¬ƒce coffee really good u country like u canada uk really nascent channel know run 100 think open distribution channel brings point think interesting cleaning jv structure pretty aggressively last five year right getting fewer fewer couple major one left understand quite profitable part ongoing plan could maybe expect see continued cleanup structure like option present consider think maybe remaining jv structure think latter think thing start make sense u thing make sense jv partner either buying selling think point star align sit talk see get right price master plan say date time going buy sell think proven last year sometimes star align think right switching operating margin talked think consolidated operating margin outlook next couple year way often phrase `` several ten basis point operating margin expansion year right outlined 1 billion worth cost save analyst day investor day next couple year get 1 billion save within organization important thing understand starting every year last year even came starbuck troy sat supply chain said `` seen plan rollout business cost good sold assuming cost good sold largest expense imagine want want give challenge go take cost supply chain keith stegner scott mawand challenge building bit every year last year 150 million billion dollar extension addition challenge year little 200 million see quickly progress 1 billion run rate important understand real rate saving come give p l business unit counting supply chain deliver p l run rate fixed asset cost avoidance come current rate level think 200 million year certainly doable get u almost 1 billion think year raise little bit push way 1 billion thing could guess around increasing sourcing saving amount present every year contract renew sourcing team going deeper far better job trying understand structurally change within starbuck vendor need change drive saving gave example investor day thought good one rolled la boulange imagine pascal team went looked recipe actually went every manufacturer every supplier made sure could deliver recipe simpler higher quality natural recipe right recognize ingredient ingredient list croissant thought given preparation product cost would go little bit forecast team went actually kind stripped entire process stud looked everything going process got better quality product little bit lower price opportunity see sourcing team opportunity transport good moving full truckload transportation grow thing around warehousing storing green coffee transporting green coffee add almost 200 million year another area think consensus say held back maybe reaching target emea operating margin talk maybe potentially reaching 20 consensus walk maybe mix business franchise versus company sale leverage realistic target maybe long take get keith stegner scott mawi think approach 20 five year really believe want say automatic math give piece go certainly mix shift towards licensed store virtually store open licensed meal start open store still opportunity lot opportunity keith come thing like store closure deal around big early opportunity executed kris engskov run region team done great job supply chain cog support cost looking individual country center taking money way run rate really operational execution think perhaps encouraging thing see mid single digit comp rate largest market uk germany france last quarter big comp tough environment competitive economy great shape able range quarter think kris continue need drive 20 operating margin importantly licensed store well well need able partner wanting open unit operating well sake royalty profitability look area like middle east alshaya growing really well high single digit comp recent quarter fantastic result 700 store alshaya big partnership u add start math mid single digit comp quarter get store base growing licensed store get 20 starbuck recently announced management change chief operating oï¬ƒcer troy alstead took coffee break kevin johnson one board member taking president ceo talk management change little bit maybe thought process behind kevin great addition board little bit color around

room would like see little bit leverage mix et cetera think optimal structure maybe path get target long time period comfortable level within balance dividend versus repurchase process think start dividend really linchpin dividend payout policy 35 45 moving within range chance next year continue move within range look dividend compare growth company take growth rate dividend payout rate certainly upper right chart feel like right dividend important u continue grow perhaps grow little faster earnings last year keith stegner scott mawthen capital buyback standpoint sorry stock buyback standpoint increasing really get dilutive effect share compensation plan committed last year leaned little bit stock bit third quarter last year bought well prepared borrow needed trick u far debt go cash level onshore likely cash level offshore u build bit debt service dividend even though u business throw massive amount cash ï¬‚ow promise everything come likely borrow amount every year fund capital activity going think likely add leverage little bit maybe add leverage ratio little bit targeted leverage ratio say add ph minus p issue billion dollar debt marching towards target want make
