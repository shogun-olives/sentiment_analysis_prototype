alright think ready get going joe moore morgan stanley happy u today colette kress cfo nvidia think colette wanted make opening hedge comment go straight absolutely okay statement read reminder presentation contains statement investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business question answer great thank well feel like go couple hour given much stuff going guy maybe could start talking forum various form large language model four year feel like 2023 important year becoming mainstream becoming every hyperscaler kind talking capability table stake going forward wonder could talk made comment earnings call last 60 day enthusiasm built see transforming demand product road could talk conversation like right q joseph moore colette m. kressyeah really good way start talking ended earnings release great statement made let kind back bit talk entered calendar year expect moving probably important understand believe ai important part computing important part accelerated computing really entered stage actually believe ai inﬂection point stemming inﬂection point focus term large language model recommend data engine natural language processing done incurred point time generative ai particularly chatgpt folk understand simple case benefit benefit use case consumer enterprise thinking develop ai within universe well monetization capability sheer eﬃciency improvement important stage important stage ai work done year bringing high end platform thinking something h100 a100 computing platform data center whole term improving eﬃciencies use acceleration key use case would ai seeing everyday interest seen holiday talking large enterprise ceo large enterprise originally focused need concentrate ai leadership team ceo understand possible whether could something easy chatbot whether simulation factory whether could even use case continue develop overtime interested well large language model built likely see lot large language model start inﬂuence case thing u.s. thing worldwide well whether foundational model whether specific industry therefore fuel csps interest csps service agreement many company need compute start work want start large language model generative ai thing continue fuel demand see think demand creation pretty clear watched cnbc day ceo ceo come say important development u need figure use better manifest people people already developing type model looking much higher level complexity looking scaling got driving new people develop model generating interest model guy talking general take excitement enthusiasm quickly turn capex nvidia opportunity ... q joseph moore colette m. kressyeah really good question term process start interesting place referred exactly see different type focus full stock focused model using ecosystem get enterprise get customer seeing every stage ai started want focus ai need help term building want design architecture two already working existing model need optimization term optimization level cuda and/or working framework even situation maybe exactly helping model starting one model optimizing existing model eﬃciencies help way focused hardware focused software really type ai help day many different opportunity procure okay procure directly csps compare procure one partner well opportunity absorb ai full platform many different way great maybe help u understand overlap kind declining budget environment hyperscalers alluded saw last quarter everyone kind thinking scaling back budget see protecting growing graphic within budget given importance workload think transition budget cut focus kind focus growth guy generating think economic time time folk focus budget focus spending however still working eﬃciencies using money using capital focus accelerated computing matter look always going improvement eﬃciency use money amount money save term moving accelerated eﬃcient computing spending le cost le cost versus existing cpu type infrastructure version legacy type computing tend front center priority even time working across enterprise eﬃcient going focus eﬃciency work therefore helping design different piece although area within q4 needed push thing nothing lost thing taking little bit time whatever different reason may term setting csps type data center important part world understood moore law u anymore drive eﬃciency overall need sustainability well focusing accelerated computing going priority accelerated computing also demonstrating ai also another added bonus focusing q joseph moore colette m. kress q joseph moore colette m. kress great guess another part going capability hopper product ramping obviously designed type model mind talked 6x transformer performance time launched important hopper transition quickly see transitioning ampere yes hopper architecture design phase many year working internally keep mind work key generative ai partner open ai created chatgpt u working u many year continue working many different partner help u design brought market unusualness h100 includes transformer engine transforming engine really modeled towards large language model yes talking year year seeing important use case continue path inﬂuence hardware specific software transformer engine infrastructure standpoint included also made huge inroad term term software hardware alone probably 5x 6x improvement last generation software even inferencing standpoint dealing maybe close 30x improvement hopper important piece allows eﬃciency believe ramp h100 focusing key workload really look use hopper however still also ship a100 also market still may great opportunity existing cluster may adding already qualified probably see h100 a100 year one surprising element least around quarter h100 bigger a100 leave rest year talked accelerating growth data center sort thinking would get big value uptick h100 ramping year seems like mix might little bit static think term drive visibility rest year yeah q4 represented probably first significant quarter h100 started production q3 q4 still ramping perspective discussed important h100 a100 see moving forward expect growth head q1 quarter right sequential standpoint expect strong growth also expect little bit growth focus accelerating growth rate rest year important piece h100 also a100 product well q joseph moore colette m. kress q joseph moore colette m. kress okay great guess accelerating growth define sort talking growth quarter growing little bit faster concern challenging july talk steep ramp year seeing today seems like maybe little bit visibility year yes growth expecting data center yes perspective expect acceleration leave q1 type growth think probably look size tam front u opportunity many different offering availability really hard say fast growth rate going know inﬂection point key focus area u great thank inference side mentioned inference performance hopper 30 time really interesting microsoft google kind bickering lowest cost per query like esoteric question inference cost suddenly like one important cost size big inference business today talk role inference think specifically two large language model road yeah everyone focus eﬃciencies inside data center looking thing costing time focus cost focus seeing term utilization across everything term data center let kind putting market platform allows training inferencing overall platform time procurement time trying optimize training side inferencing heard synergy across could probably benefit time could spending working large language model training next week could mark term inferencing side improvement training side inferencing side term improving productivity also important able capture power improperly utilized accelerated computing well time may improve training better h100 also improved overall inferencing well improved whole system see people moving training inferencing platform complexity seeing inferencing really stem large language model using accelerated computing inferencing well software utilization power overall accelerated computing probably see training inferencing cost come time q joseph moore colette m. kress q joseph moore colette m. kress q joseph moore colette m. kress hard classify guess part correct ca determine point time much done training inferencing individual box believe training important part today made great inroad meaningful amount inferencing well great bigger opportunity see going forward okay great thank maybe could shift little bit new initiative talked call dgx cloud kind explain u scope nvidia ambition term kind cloud service capability offered within bigger cloud service provider yeah dgx cloud new offering going bring market really focused ai service essentially browser work enterprise really trying help enterprise computing matter want whether want csps cloud whether want hybrid environment whether want get djx cloud opportunity instance cloud nvidia help full stack software full stack service access model access engineering help pay csp instance provide opportunity choose csp want host pay piece also still opportunity enterprise work csps also purchase full stack csps well selling csps work directly enterprise host help see csp instance equally allows ﬂexibility speed quickly possible working continue work working u term designing model designing infrastructure term nvidia providing nvidia created model around large language model thing like scope would put competition cloud customer instance model creating model whether large language model anything footprint start work actually help full design today term helping optimize model eﬃciencies continue csps also may host model still opportunity working many q joseph moore colette m. kress q joseph moore colette m. kress q joseph moore colette m. kressthose customer model well difference work year csps continued grow significantly optimizing infrastructure term standing optimizing infrastructure acceleration model great thank leave data center question inspur come lot investor added entity list chinese server company last week talk much impact could nvidia yeah inspur partner u indicated partner helping u stand computing end end customer work forward probably working partner compute within region even part world important focus focusing law making sure follow export control closely case look term partner help u busy year lawyer guess inaudible okay great maybe could talk little bit software business model guy revenue generating capability talk scale overtime yeah software business important part enterprise work enterprise staffed engineer many csps even largest company world able established full stack software start start end cuda cuda dnn different library system software everything really get close application established full stack software license enterprise start instantaneously already x86 type computing capability need ai work need inﬂuence incorporate application use industry application stock actually help put together still case access software also access service continue improve software overtime q joseph moore colette m. kress q joseph moorenow software business right hundred million look still growth opportunity go forward got three different area focus software nvidia aie enterprise stock give full stack ai solution use enterprise also use omniverse also sell separately omniverse great path 3d internet focusing term simulating factory manufacturing work thirdly see going forward automotive derived platform heard mercedes last week talked use drive software sharing software u three key area lot software opportunity also work term software service overall ai surface also addition great wanted ask gaming see question audience sense gaming 7 billion sell business think one point talked kind 10 billion last last year china weaker also new product cycle general thinking seems pretty clear shipping sense much yeah finished q4 feel really good going q1 inventory correction needed behind u essentially normalized channel probably hit u within q1 channel normalized give u opportunity continue selling newest architecture ada last quarter able launch ada able see excitement gamers term new architecture 4090 4080 4070 ti three really well period watch overall watch look demand articulated probably 2.5 billion quarter give take seasonality specific quarter h2 usually larger demand h1 feel really get position actually closer start getting closer grow gaming perspective track sure little bit volatility china covid solid demand gaming still absolutely exists worldwide think business mean look back 10 year see disruptive inﬂuence cryptocurrency six 10 year causing kind shortage inaudible cycle going forward much steady growth type business volatility always going continue somewhat choppy trend mean growth obviously choppier growth trend colette m. kress q joseph moore q unidentified participant colette m. kress probably consistent many year focus gamers wanting best infrastructure gaming experience well innovation come whether programmable shading 10 year ago today term ray tracing important piece fueled gaming gaming transformed 10 year transformed entertainment industry gamer pc home bigger social platform well think continue see growth believe part key part crypto behind u u win heart many different gamers ability multiple platform also reach gamers term desktop seen transformation laptop notebook really take place drive type gaming would desktop device really technology putting gpus inside laptop inﬂuence ray tracing enabled well ray tracing really helped game developer really add realistic capability infused ai help game developer build best type real game going forward 350 game dl going forward going continue add innovation yes think opportunity u going forward great let pause see question audience keep calling sir mic somewhere thank report last week amazon web service enough compute capacity demand launch new ai product curious data center chip side worried running shortage able serve demand hyperscale customer maybe address thank yeah every csp go capacity challenge different part data center one piece focused building eﬃcient capacity run problem along way know challenge may ready accept even gpu thing saw end q4 sure enough know spend time getting understanding able accept start building still ramping process h100 demand strong could time week quarter careful term whether going able make strong demand stay focused yes demand right certainly important part u right got good process supply let see work q joseph moore colette m. kress q joseph moore colette m. kress hear type anecdote first thinking probably hopper challenge may seems like a100 inventory correct ramped h100 probably going key area focus yes existing architecture also sell question question audience mentioned mercedes thing know talking year anyone gone back look mercedes analyst day slide mean nvidia unlike every slide like really impressive degree inﬂuencer program essentially endorsed economics guy talking economic split 1 billion plus mid decade kind end decade talk relationship guy think automotive opportunity much thing like full system development really good economics opposed selling card chip know also lot win well think biggest economic upside nvidia opportunity develops mercedes work phenomenal think understood lighthouse leading company automotive importance av safety transformation automotive industry software important part car going forward working together many year part ﬂeet come market calendar 2025 important piece continue think type business model work many industry well time working mercedes inside car know also looking key lighthouse helping manufacturing ﬂoor talking different business model focus omniverse generate eﬃciencies factory ﬂoor opportunity always thinking industry industry top player helping end end great business model u take different sort case may sell somebody infrastructure may case may sell full software may change term different component different part data center infrastructure important term building ecosystem building platform approach nothing would turn away help get ai accelerated computing q joseph moore colette m. kress great lot opportunity front thank much time today great thank
