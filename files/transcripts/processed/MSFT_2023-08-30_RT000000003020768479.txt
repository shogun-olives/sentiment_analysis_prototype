right well room got little bit quiet think live good morning everybody brad zelnick deutsche bank software team welcome db tech conference delighted everybody room online listening session truly delighted welcome none microsoft evp security mr.charlie bell charlie thank much u oh great nice setting learned sunny irvine california yes grew know whole area kind nice get back smoke sunshine well glad thank much really looking learn lot microsoft strategy security thank much joining u mind maybe silence important may want take always take call mom even call charlie bell brad zelnick charlie bell q brad zelnick charlie bell mom okay would take call question answer question answer maybe mind know could take minute explain role microsoft mandate actually sure well maybe best way kind wind clock back first started thinking something new amazon amazon 22 year know january jeff bezos said going step away thought thought wow going different world could keep good time building cloud thought thought going something new moment age thought get thing deeply ca year thing thought well going something new really analyze think either stick something else thing got right away something seen year customer cloud computing growth problem security really bothered see end sight actually getting far worse whole shared responsibility model diﬃcult customer thought lot thought grew funny talking wife way brilliant woman look someday said `` know talk satya nadella said `` said `` talk satya microsoft lot security great company moment said okay fine within week two knew satya way old story back early 2000s satya q brad zelnicksatya tried recruit amazon course trying recruit met amazon one senior leader called redmond saturday talking satya thing impressed first know already formed microsoft call customer solution area around security saw problem talked way try sell recruited trying push `` hey charlie ought join microsoft listening asking question answering question mostly interested thinking security result conversation talked two major engineering leader rajesh shah run productivity user side business scott guthrie run azure cloud side business really great conversation realized lot thing realized one engineering company microsoft really inventing lot also thoughtful scale course security problem thought security problem realized one company really going solve issue going provider see many thing provider knew running cloud see customer currently using thing problem see going issue much attracted fact microsoft really say three pillar addition security business three pillar service cloud going read problem one providing infrastructure cloud really important end user productivity world bad actor start people one weak link course identity business microsoft move world zero trust know talking talking microsoft far away largest capability area yes talked satya came two year ago formed csa done taking product engineering product scott rajesh united one organization brought thing together mandate thing security way also read inaudible ciso report protecting microsoft internal security microsoft well lot equal lot learning go microsoft ground zero attacker learn lot yes mandate excellent thank much touched bit next question still ask mean momentum recent year security charlie bell q brad zelnick charlie bellbeen nothing short impressive high level start giving u sense overarching strategy couple key thing think really differentiates microsoft security context highly highly competitive even noisy market yes well like said one thing thought carefully breadth scale problem mean one thing realize problem getting smaller getting larger estimate take negative drain world economy bad actor represent gone 6 trillion think estimated 10 trillion 2025 growing faster indian economy think top 20 gdp fastest growing economy problem getting diﬃcult need solve offering got cover full spectrum attacker work start end user dish somebody compromise account use whatever privilege person lever somebody real privilege person use move laterally environment use piece use network identity productivity application main application infrastructure use really thinking going solve problem focus area think world moving direction seen ciso survey pretty radical shift thinking going back like 10 year generally piece together solution getting best breed literally hundred different solution read security problem going consolidation trying figure get attacker find seam thing part driving make sense charlie think december microsoft disclosed security 20 billion plus business time growing north 30 year versus broader security market think growing somewhere teen obviously backdrop become bit challenging since talk seen term customer demand ability take share environment mean clearly consolidation play quite unique yes well think one major beneficiary consolidation move see healthy growth million organization protected number grew 26 last year really interesting number customer using four workload number gone 33 intensity increase intensity think going think lot optimization people typically see happen short period time long period time way think q brad zelnick charlie bell q brad zelnick charlie bellabout said like going 10 trillion drag gdp going grow seen estimate say could pas u.s. economy gdp 2030s get ahead signal demand think going lot need security product going forward strong signal seem abating story year maybe think 2021 satya announced plan invest 20 billion security 2026 obviously player credibly make kind statement wherewithal talk r prioritization criterion use generative ai might impact composition perhaps even level overall investment going forward yes well one reason came microsoft looked asset microsoft leadership satya propensity bring bear security first thing going turn corner first component data talk asymmetry attacker attacker come point defend entire perimeter asymmetry favor data get see entire environment one beauty cloud provider get see one environment get see lot environment data asymmetry work advantage 65 trillion signal day processed within product fact data think huge advantage bringing bear investment making super important brought together industry like take product break cute acronym everything sase xdr siem soar siem soar yes like break way think fragmented world certainly natural want talk name fragment talk basically blurred line thing like siem xdr soar thing really going got blur line start data lot investment way prerequisite probably biggest change going see security one going q brad zelnick charlie bell q brad zelnickto finally think turn corner big part data world ca see act use matter able far one challenge security industry siloing expertise think company know network security company know security maybe something identity endpoint company expertise want branch expertise fundamentally got able get across ai got able take data signal understand expert soc development organization building proactive defense nobody really understand ai ca ai call shift right good responding attack ai move fast see across whole bunch variable take action proactive sense ai look broad environment lot different technology understand across need done way thinking came one thing saw astounded old job github copilot amazing thinking obviously kind thing amazing good really dug realized partnership microsoft openai go way back r partnership understanding microsoft llm technology could pretty clear lot security really opened door think even gone faster thought saw could core building ai capability thing think get u around corner finally asymmetry defender mean using ai well right beauty data get see whole environment get go still go thing get see way get aggregate everything think finally advantage ai maybe lead next question back theme touched consolidation feel like promise industry newcomer stumble upon problem domain naturally would say okay customer want make stop swimming charlie bell q brad zelnick charlie bellthese point product always cybersecurity always arm race consolidation along promise think consolidation finally happening give confidence history fragmentation seen pocket consolidation firewall endpoint player done still vendor rsa show ﬂoor every year easily count help buck certainty always quite time well like many thing idea something happen look technology mature enough finally reach point get technological maturity came provider look capability microsoft data like able process huge amount data talking 65 trillion signal day sure talk massive input data come customer building unique environment got able process huge amount data got able real time finally ability handle huge volume petabyte scale log coming ability issue query across able real time respond messaging system lot cloud technology really begun enable think one ai side think fact bring ai bear look across signal silo mean always seat talked long time zero trust well aggregator zero trust microsoft conditional access saw side identity system basically went whole kind maturation protected password figured needed mfa needed authentication needed something else said yeah charlie trust thing started get intercepted need ai look across infrastructure say `` well looking end user variable looking system variable looking ip address system identifier think charlie charlie going lot capability built year kind technology work tend layer thing think finally enough technology q brad zelnick charlie belland also think go back satya understanding kind fundamental human progress technology one reason wanted share view technology company win people confidently move forward adopt new technology like going ai right genai got able use tremendous thing feel safely afraid seeing bad thing happen want use wo buy security go way back bill like around 2001 2002 trusted computing memo microsoft figured really business people feel confident moving forward think spot everybody interest microsoft interest going continue invest make easy people move background security default eventually really get hump guy wo even talking one day trust resonates quite bit go back march several month ago response microsoft proclaimed world thing talking trillion loss economy shortage talent really understand cyber fragmentation customer forced deal answer security copilot believe combine capability proprietary microsoft security model remind u product maybe feedback getting preview even potential monetization structure milestone looking investor going forward progress security copilot well first chatgpt looking vulnerability kind telling like order security side hopefully maybe guy played microsoft 365 ability summarize something security side got get lot technical analysis signal looking log coming machine think kind little different application generative ai often say security team sport well within ai world building copilot team sport llm specially trained model example one thing llm able query data well going well separate capability know system problem exciting came microsoft well two year ago end august getting started llm security look thing across board stitch together got able go data signal got able let customer bring signal done safely one challenge think ai space start systematizing large language model oh gosh thing going looking lot data protect data accessing make sure customer take stuff customer able see something get model way guaranteed separation thing got make sure model manipulated one challenge large language model operate prompt people manipulate answer going thing lot lot red teaming understanding base model separate model combination system going behave actually taken quite long journey u something think part r development given u lot understanding problem go solve also let u work openai kind thing done level also capability way say journey got private preview customer working think first reaction customer astounded like fact able thing tell problem stop right think reaction first time saw capability producing change security forever fundamentally new way thing also pretty call r resource intensive said taking chatgpt saying summarize really whole bunch thing got go system level make thing work back forth u core team model microsoft openai long journey going going begin introducing thing customer think little broadly later year roll think far monetization thing say going lot investment part lot gpus go spend way thing security model guy go web start playing chatgpt bing start going back forth well time inference security model lot inference like order system level job q brad zelnick charlie bell q brad zelnick charlie bellresource intensive going going separate important business microsoft maybe topic monetization balance interest direct monetization versus indirect monetization creating trust therefore better sell rest security portfolio azure oﬃce copilot everything else mean microsoft know amy going let spend money spending gpus without return big picture right one reason excited working provider ﬂywheel paid security business free security business provider going provide security default embedded bunch stuff continually launch kind new thing window example done tremendous number thing identity offering entra come customer get part business give customer confidence move forward product indirect monetization interest provider make sure people safe get go ﬂywheel learn get build top get find unique need customer say bank example severe regulatory requirement segmentation duty okay going need special functionality able analogy use got car everybody buy car buy snow tire car going buy extra stuff need always going monetization incredibly important area think thing provide part product well helpful context want respectful time much talk charlie broad topic maybe pivoting another acronym think big news couple month ago microsoft announced entry sase market microsoft entra area feel really win think microsoft value prop get away securing window core microsoft 365 apps azure service well first want say one part conversation satya got microsoft probing understand protecting q brad zelnick charlie bellmicrosoft product think securing thing back head thought one thing observed ca say cloud cloud going world people going use many thing historically go look technology everybody always used polygon technology nothing else get acquisition using long time adopt new one thing resonated protecting everything ding ding ding become say look care whether launched security world microsoft protect aws protect gcp protect people technology committed whole idea think sase maybe best kind wind back little bit really think zero trust really mean zero trust trust anything like system moment system start default trust something say yeah okay without checking well entry point network like often talked zero trust like kind networking thing well zero trust broad concept core conditional access entra ability said take whole bunch variable network variable lot mark say ai perspective access access ability natural extension thing announced entra think idea going got able thing customer tell u u saying hey think ought go customer saying hey guy really need giving u capability got make sense look back five year metric think know successful objective measure microsoft business unit held accountable mean remember many year ago arrived heard actually related azure ad metric many business measured one many criterias objective many identity bring azure ad horizon know really crushed achieved goal think measuring well mean think revenue good one mean customer see value sort obvious one really proud q brad zelnick charlie bell q brad zelnick charlie bellcrossing 20 billion mark kind big milestone actually one thing would make super happy stopped talking gdp loss bigger u.s. economy 2030s like suddenly whole trajectory changing look say hey maybe 10 trillion loss come true see tilt trajectory would really big milestone think u yes mean continue number organization protected track kind detailed metric protected user everything else yes would say big one changed trajectory growth happening cool charlie time anything get wished asked want impress upon folk mean work obviously incredibly important microsoft success important world final thought well sometimes talk kind loss guy see headline time want everybody optimistic one thing got really love idea human progress technology apply technology new problem get solve new problem think going able think key asymmetry talked fact going able aggregate across large volume data using ai going able turn corner thing yes mean look look nation state russia attack china attack north korea iran whole unit spends lot time area understanding adversary kind depressing sometimes think look think human nature going change think going bad people continue thing think industry going pretty healthy would want anybody think oh gosh got run hill hide think making real progress excited cool well counting charlie thank much deutsche bank tech conference really really great thanks q brad zelnick cheer
