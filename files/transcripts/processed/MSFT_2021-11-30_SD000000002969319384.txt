happy tell little bit story think it’s pretty story point still there’s always something new going remember back early day talking microsoft cloud big could get year wrong year we’re wrong guessed kind quit guessing point said cloud’s ubiquitous satya interesting perspective say anything show opex potential think true company spending money way opex that’s something brought computer brought cloud started everybody primarily starting infrastructure data became pretty quickly relevant it’s saas it’s ml ai think keep growing think power keep getting exponentially better start infrastructure that’s well good it’s pretty simple process you’re actually running saas app reason data use ml help run business better think it’s much powerful that’s sort we’re question answer yes let’s focus azure actually 10th anniversary azure bull wrote 2011 outlook report saying hey begin 13 azure infrastructure service came sort doubled obviously we’ve seen year year year steady share gain think past five quarter four past five azure outgrowing google cloud five five outgrown aws think seeing customer leading incremental share gain microsoft well think see value prop certainly there’s thing going company think one we’re global cloud there’s lot company want assurance they’re going move new geo there’s cloud support think global nature help u ton helped u land big deal even country like china it’s phil winslow dave o’harahard break cloud infrastructure support that’s big benefit u think also best security world security software big push lot company last decade even recently last five year think we’re pretty well positioned go team super popular pandemic course helped drive adoption happen good position right time even though team years’ worth investment get got sort start early thing recently announced industry cloud industry cloud generating lot buzz lot interest customer course want something that’s closer that’s it’s intended industry cloud getting lot traction think keep adding would emphasize ai ml data functionality reason figure better way run business that’s people ultimately looking keep moving closer closer specific customer need let’s industry cloud little bit think that’s also point sort one differentiator microsoft microsoft cloud focus industry wonder share little bit focus area within industry cloud opening opportunity growth sure industry cloud announced healthcare retail manufacturing nonprofit sustainability financial service industry everybody unique need look migration infrastructure data saas industry cloud it’s natural get closer customer looking let use sustainability example lot interest sustainability cloud pick one announced announced going preview judson call customer europe another call customer north america surprised attendance lot lot people called two specific question isn’t sort ethereal idea like hey need make real going make real industry cloud help u make real there’s ton interest industry cloud also think it’s beginning launched industry cloud it’s like check box called done we’re going continue build phil winslow dave o’hara phil winslowand we’re going continue make specific customer specific get financial perspective there’s obviously competitor infrastructure business lot time margin might get driven competition differentiate industry cloud think put u better position company better position help customer sustainability cloud shocked much interest mean knew would interest expected interesting interesting commercial booking continue grow double digit last quarter amy noted really driven consistent execution across new renewal sale motion come new deal tipping point mind like sort microsoft win well think one hybrid story started early hybrid story company invested lot microsoft offer lot investment said hey don’t want throw paid it’s working it’s functional going came hybrid strategy hey you’re azure customer we’ll give licensing benefit customer move it’s good move initial pitch cloud everybody remembers hey lift shift throw stuff move cloud said look moderated way thoughtful way started really take two think we’re seen trusted partner trusted provider mentioned security software think continue build security software insight global internet lot company don’t reach breadth think allows u provide good secure software mentioned continue come ubiquitously beneficial product like team company benefit add value team phone functionality add really drive adoption cloud think put u good position talk customer want know they’re going safe secure it’s reliable it’s global functionality need think that’s we’re got another kind question think existing customer growth coming new dave o’hara phil winslow dave o’hara phil winslow dave o’haraproducts increasing consumption new seat moving premium skus point call new product new service little we’re constantly adding new service azure people consume new service drive consumption nice thing consumption model everybody realizes don’t know smart thought time nice thing consumption it’s capped mean you’re selling licensed product there’s certain fixed amount market share consumption really think it’s satya said literally you’re spending opex that’s opportunity u that’s potential tam think that’s driving lot consumption new service certainly even modern work perspective look new stuff we’re adding e5 sku started really certain set service getting adoption look microsoft think important part u microsoft cloud it’s azure cloud it’s modern work cloud it’s microsoft cloud including dynamic including many thing we’re think that’s expansion coming existing customer new customer see benefit one company that’s running ... call sort azure oﬃce power power oﬃce azure pipeline back forth that’s i’m sort sticking microsoft cloud question first three working together yes let’s drill little bit azure want hit consumption base think key point obviously thriving mentioned structure agreement strategy help facilitate consumption growth sure think it’s always everything evolution evolution well think there’s much cost upfront term people thought building data center infrastructure basically said need good contract need able build viable business we’re willing commit need willing commit u still work customer contract we’ve also built lot ﬂexibility phil winslow dave o’hara phil winslowif somebody say don’t know much i’m going consume go paygo deal consume consume even thing like meter make sure don’t go certain amount give maximum ﬂexibility term pay work making sure even modern work another example like right number user many user user think build maximum ﬂexibility contract customer pay use got awesome obviously mentioned sort breadth depth azure portfolio continues expand think sort rate pace innovation inside azure also affect gross margin azure initially point move sort stack infrastructure yes it’s always interesting report financial result it’s sort numeric grand plan there’s sort grand plan think it’s lot thing coming together one keep driving revenue growth fortunately hasn’t issue anybody cloud business there’s lot revenue growth opportunity secondly always sort focused approach we’re going drive cost we’re going make eﬃcient pas customer it’s part price competitive it’s also part making cloud eﬃcient think timing come thing get built get built get built folk asked feel example feel data center expansion we’re covering 90 globe like 95 gdp feel good we’re still need add capacity geos think we’ve seen moderated capex spend maybe relative basis historically good revenue growth driving cost moderating capex spend tend margin expansion that’s kind we’re it’s thing come together it’s one thing it’s sort like plan happens sort maniacally focused thing getting better okay expanding product it’s like increased consumption frankly secular shift accelerated secular shift cloud one question get frankly microsoft keep sale hiring essentially side support innovation trend dave o’hara phil winslow dave o’hara yes i’d say knock wood there’s wood would say right good talent pool coming u saying hey we’d love work microsoft think culturally we’re perceived pretty good place work think positioning perspective people feel like we’re well positioned think salesperson feel like come something go sell company it’s got value continue add value mean it’s super competitive market everybody hiring everybody else there’s lot horse trading going employee think overall relative basis we’re pretty good position far we’ve able keep way that’s question sale think it’s question engineering think it’s question support hopefully it’s question finance people although we’re usually happy job we’re still think there’s it’s competition labor right think we’re okay knock wood got right touched azure let’s go oﬃce oﬃce commercial going pipeline discussed obviously oﬃce 365 installed base keep growing arpu keep increasing even call dynamic maybe installed base growth coming help u walk guess break 2 sort growth installed base seeing growth come arpu think sort arpu growth yes would say people there’s sort might historical perception oﬃce literally oﬃce word excel powerpoint we’ve expanded far beyond think continue add value continue add skus help arpu growth used e1 sku talked e3 people always asking like going 50 penetration d3 ask question e5 architected e5 really said hey let’s go identify place value customer might underserved might better position provide outside classic oﬃce came said really think it’s communication think it’s security think it’s analytics that’s that’s team came started product called link bought skype evolution came team think we’re pretty good position communication team’s usage number we’ve published lately happen good business take advantage comm stuff landing security always big issue think people getting smarter think analytics phil winslow dave o’hara phil winslow dave o’hara phil winslow dave o’haraand think oﬃce migrating folk e1 e3 e5 natural progression think lot benefiting seeing we’re getting better penetration e5 would also say usage perspective we’ve come lot functionality that’s directly beneficial small business frontline worker we’re adding user time you’re migrating e1 e3 e5 driving arpu we’re adding user frontline worker sku it’s like several moving thing end resulting number key u make sure we’re continuing add value skus provide value skus end good arpu growth good usage growth yes think bring great point like said finance folk like look number like oh here’s gap revenue growth seat growth there’s arpu inside seat growth inside arpu two different dynamic guess make arpu increase even impressive sense hey lot unit growth coming ... frontline worker frontline worker yes it’s it’s can’t focus one number focus individual driver think that’s we’ve gotten better focusing individual driver come number yes talked e5 amy talked july 8 penetration o365 commercial installed base thinking e5 adoption within thinking enterprise voice mentioned team phone sort strategy sure tried make easy possible customer make use e5 said bundle communication security analytics also came many skus lot people say look don’t want whole thing i’ll take piece we’ve seen time customer go okay i’ll start one start security hey i’ll add comms hey analytics stuff kind bad maybe i’ll go go know we’ll buy e5 think it’s allowing people consume really need time time phil winslow dave o’hara phil winslowspirit microsoft cloud think see benefit point make attractive go whole way piece think it’s early day adoption e5 obviously 8 isn’t we’re going finish we’re going force people go we’re going big push get fast we’re going let migrate make sense yes point everybody asking when’s penetration e3 there’s e5 next question next time we’re i’m going ask e7 coming let’s focus team thing announced july earnings almost 250 million monthly active team user obviously point huge hockey stick past two year october call said usage never higher simply monthly active user actually usage monthly active user higher ever think monetization strategy team question get lot obviously it’s included o365 sort strategy monetization addressable market well one think people expect u continue deliver new value modern work stuff get built it’s new value people looking they’re already paying u include thinking team said hey want people use want people consume want people benefit let’s sort constrain charging they’re already paying u decent amount money anyhow still even referenced previous question forgot answer team phone stuff 80 million team phone user think that’s example people monetize people get additional benefit case go throughout pbx pretty expensive system switch team there’s huge value add think there’s addition core team platform way monetize beyond even industry cloud tapping team that’s way they’re going operate it’s direct doesn’t directly monetizable team think monetizable thing work team think key u continue gain share feel good share we’re gaining build around add value think there’s plenty way monetize even it’s directly yes sort engagement living team speak mean credit suisse one thing path we’re going signed like contract pbx guy telephony folk it’s like actually want terminate team even though we’re using hosted pbx dave o’hara phil winslow dave o’hara phil winslow dave o’hara phil winslow dave o’harawe signed contract it’s like actually still want terminate team actually becomes hub ... point option might everybody go think that’s good example also think u isvs want build team platform there’s opportunity monetize well we’re seeing lot isv interest it’s sort mean everybody know isvs operate add value specific piece software mostly look like big user base get certain number user like hey want build around we’re seeing lot isvs show interest team team platform i’m much looking forward team avatar pretty confident coming i’m going trick it’s yes i’d say yes we’re little slow we’re bank roll new feature couple senior exec show every meeting avatar yes it’s like get ready marketing call near avatar phil coming power platform that’s call almost like hidden success sort secret success inside microsoft you’ve obviously seen strong growth mentioned recently talked 20 million monthly active user sort value actually maybe step back people don’t know like power platform involved seeing strong growth well think we’re seeing strong growth power platform allows people basically write low code code essentially help world become developer look powerhouse power platform real value add ease use also ﬂexibility ability create apps quickly we’ve customer would come u think evolution cloud used lift shift optimize we’re getting point we’ve customer 10,000 12,000 apps they’re trying figure geez migrate apps phil winslow dave o’hara phil winslow dave o’hara phil winslowcloud look go know maybe don’t need apps maybe rewrite apps might cut number apps might go add new apps power apps power platform really allows lot people become developer lot people build apps fit exact usage done background u think that’s driver adoption get involved lot customer conversation deal invariably we’ll talk microsoft cloud dynamic azure modern work end circle around go hey really want power apps like really want power apps many people get it’s interesting almost becomes anchor deal like see hidden treasurer interesting what’s next power platform it’s amazing much evolved organically inorganically product innovation you’re excited well think ease use going great also think ultimate thing put power hand user put power hand customer let evolve need go we’ll continue make product better powerful easy use think user dictate go think would say it’s get infrastructure get data get saas app understand usage pattern reason machine learning ai that’s real power come think people start apps tailored they’re trying think unleashes lot power we’ll continue see strong demand got last five minute i’ll pause moment see question audience raise hand i’ll call otherwise i’ll keep going list okay we’re killing we’ve answered we’ve answered we’re killing q actually want ai/ml think that’s one obviously i’d say artificial intelligence could impactful call technology innovation others walk dave o’hara phil winslow dave o’hara phil winslow dave o’hara phil winslow dave o’haraus sort evolution ai/ml inside microsoft inside azure think adoption cycle actually productizing yes think it’s super early term productize ai ml level remember conversation bos year ago like monetize stuff said hey we’ll figure go part making available microsoft cloud making ubiquitous ai advanced far mean remember first started said hey let’s figure one thing would look people credit check customer call treasury say credit check somebody wrote simple bot use bot salesperson go enters customer name boom it’s taken care human interaction save thousand hour eventually add think we’re getting much sophisticated connecting data source connecting reasoning even internal stuff machine learning every quarter get better better better think that’s ultimately it’s going go think it’s super early day term tap yes wxactly yes mean mean probably eating dog food forecasting ai/ml side still there’s still human involved think there’s still judgment made get pattern recognition reason think that’s ultimately it’s going yes i’ve joked like swear it’s tightening range guidance like that’s machine it’s it’s partly machine people people course would say finance team think it’s natural people say computer going knock job finance team said hey we’re going you’re still going involved we’re also going free time go work customer show phil winslow dave o’hara phil winslow dave o’hara phil winslowworks we’ve isn’t isn’t really natural thing finance person get phone customer everything either pre post think year something like 1,500 finance folk worked directly customer solution automate lot stuff free folk go work meaningful impactful thing think that’s ultimate benefit don’t put much equity research capability power automate that’s one caveat guess would say pull back effort sorry last question unless anything audience think sort due management team perspective next call fiscal year top mind well think need it’s super competitive environment need make sure we’re working directly customer getting direct feedback adapting we’ve learned nimble don’t know would described u nimble five 10 year ago we’ve learned nimble that’s one two mentioned recruitment mean it’s business we’re growing huge business top line commercial side 20 folk going help think recruitment retention employee making sure
