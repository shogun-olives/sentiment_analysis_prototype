right thank much like rob csongor investor relation vp nvidia talk thing graphic tegra apologize need give quick safe harbor start please note important disclosure including personal holding disclosure morgan stanley disclosure appear morgan stanley public website www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures registration desk maybe could start u give kind minute overview nvidia position market bunch question ask okay sure guess would start arguably one toughest year think pc market one thing always like mention people right get whatever newest headwind nvidia able achieve record year record revenue record gross margin record cash announced dividend repurchased share record year tegra said would grow tegra business 50 know business tech last year grew 50 despite one lousiest year think memory pc market one toughest environment mobile think point last year last year versus mean started last year ﬂood thailand supply issue tsmc android market rough start would say time really point 199 tablet thing basically developed year think proud proud able execute think one thing often like highlight showcase fact executing pretty well pretty tough headwind last four year think one number one question get company possible gpu business grow pc market ﬂat declining trying show street little transparency business show really 5 pc market represents pc gaming work station computing really drive majority business term gross margin segment market robust look last four year gpus grown consistently grew gpu business 8 last year excluding chipset business exiting already talked tegra business think going year position year versus last year night day last year fermi fermi generation gpus year kepler last year real design android disarray year good year established position tablet last year lte modem would say probably one significant development term position better last year week announced tegra 4i first integrated lte processor mobile processor open fair amount mobile market u focus acquisition icera point extremely pleased roughly 20 month acquiring icera integrated lte processor engaging market announced tegra i500 ce right family product application processor side start app processor well lte modem additional integrated part allows u address larger segment phone market think going forward year would say lot question also announced surprise year new gpu business new growth business gpus called grid selling gpus cloud product basically grid enterprise grid professional grid gaming going talk lot new segment new business upcoming gpu technology conference well investor day april 11th course term core business would say year status business going forward year think kepler year pc gaming continues strong robust think notebook notebook market see declining looking forward another year good share notebook q joe moore rob csongorthe quadro business declined last year amount finally transitioning kepler may noted q4 quadro business 10 several quarter relative weakness tesla growth business u right one growth opportunity sell gpus computer think relatively year year would say kind quick summary state business think looking forward next year beyond versus last year question answer right great nvidia one intriguing stock cover sense lot opportunity diﬃcult model diﬃcult know exactly worth yet seem pretty exciting like walk go product portfolio leave time question end may get everything think mundane thing could really work guy graphic think pretty bullish attach rate commentary gamer market continues robust also competition competitor amd lot different thing stretched r budget spending money varying console seems like stretched little bit thin time guy putting money pc graphic sort accelerate away well smiling right person asked spending money pc graphic frankly point position right leveraging investment made kepler going enjoy second think gained lot share year thanks kepler think enjoy good share coming year going enjoy benefit kepler throughout year said people always ask amd telling people amd amd expect fight hard ever far concerned said last year said saying year expect nothing different nothing different q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moorethey competition gpus going fight hard year last year hard fought year change great way know took u year develop kepler right instead game console instead xbox 360 wii developing tegra developing grid developing virtual gpu capability gpus developing cuda computing pick choose invest make sense grid lot number around grid model mean talk grid could play revenue opportunity guy ultimately paying much going pay big could well short answer ca tell today going talk lot grid year coming soon fact upcoming gpu technology conference actually opening financial community actually going give presentation immediately following keynote specifically targeted investment community okay going talk lot new business nvidia lot way nvidia business changing quite bit yes know lot question new business sometimes better u get make little headway market establish customer stuff roll guy say hey guess think rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongorso going tell today model going tell model today obviously believe one let talk little bit maybe qualitatively grid divided three grid enterprise product think value proposition grid enterprise accelerate existing vdi implementation accelerate existing citrix vmware type setup good news obviously market vdi used convenient good could use little performance boost acceleration particularly application done worked closely citrix vmware cisco guy accelerate existing implementation think going think market second market little bit tougher one try size called grid professional deploying basically working partner accelerate deliver certain specific application saas software service application like solidworks autodesk third one grid gaming one potentially large business demonstrated demonstrated stage somebody simply interacting television game console connected pc box television ethernet wire look perspective available market nvidia deliver goodness gpu gone pc large power supply gpu display connected internet arguably bigger console market term way people looking potentially let mean gone positioned console competitive announced partner interesting partner actually working carrier actual implementation right q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe mooreyes announced number middleware partner people industry know exactly middleware guy people think know right look closely realize guy building lot infrastructure large service provider carrier okay great helpful tegra 4 lot back forth best product apps processor probably little cynical tegra 4 announced put pretty impressive stats mean much lower power consumption use case higher number design win point tegra 3 life think making compelling sale broaden beyond tegra 3 well tegra 4 position fastest world fastest mobile processor anchor position anchor position last year tegra 3 difference last year world fastest mobile processor without modem world fastest mobile processor without modem ca sell lot phone could sell sold tablet saw business grew 50 jumped tablet market able grow really couple design year going see lot tablet lot skus vendor lot ﬂavors everything think android world going better functionality lower price offering option think going see lot connected tablet year telco carrier offering modem support basically family plan thing basically throw opposed get new bill every month let see else well talking idea yes mean worth noting high market share last year rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor oh right right merchant market limited samsung apple much share mean guy swept almost everything else window rt stuff right well lot tablet right tegra 4 position relative tegra 3 yes think benchmark result talking reestablished position fastest mobile processor difference lte right modem i500 selling sampling think week first phone guy announced think zte announced week building tegra 4 phone building upcoming phone also tegra 4 well i500 okay think see announcement particularly phone side later year get closer production big news obviously u week tegra 4i right q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongorso think quick answer question nvidia entering connected device market year think significant thing far beyond phone think come lte modem think tricky investor used thinking existing field baseband competitor guy relatively news go ask competitor think kind approach taking icera cynical competitor maybe talk give u comfort going something large presence mean sound like sort second guy market lte space right going would expect turn type baseband market share position number two would well think secret sauce mean architectural strategic position position radio opposed device implication pretty significant mean tegra 4i half size competing product qualcomm pretty significant prove get qualified prove going battery test familiar couple design last year phone tablet kind cut teeth get many people may think first product nvidia mean icera making modem since 2006 yes 95 different carrier qualification large number country familiar process first modem okay q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe mooreso think end day devil detail yes deliver advanced feature deliver performance deliver low power think make think fine mobile world congress week exactly showing okay fact qualified already data mean fairly relevant still tablet opportunity thing inaudible sure competition say yes voice right anyway course mean done voice qualification yes tablet use right asus vivo rt lte modem icera lte modem mean obviously announced last year yes data modem qual voice qualification take longer harder get carrier comfortable rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore yes take longer okay yes voice qual typically take longer people asked would describe year mean nvidia perspective extremely exciting time engaging connected device market market market welcoming alternative solution think u going exciting term device visibility term revenue think year primarily build validate year build certify okay look revenue think mostly least phone really going 2014 okay great formally announced grey last week tegra 4i right emailed lte integrated a9 could feel smoke coming email like much maybe could tell u view yes email kind two together never going show harm rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor never going show engineering department email would insult yes mean tegra 4i focus talked earlier kidding focus everything number one focus product since acquired icera product designed one purpose one purpose nail perf per square millimeter perf per watt looked chip looked complete architecture taking everything best everything learned far modem side relatively easy pretty much i500 rest pretty diﬃcult though mean basically custom architecture number potential engine could use tegra 4 graphic engine new second generation basically battery saver ability single core running low power second generation implementation basically look tegra 4i tegra 4 graphic engine core instead 72 us chimera computational photography engine tegra 4 different cpu architecture though basically created custom version looking perf per square millimeter perf per watt could go quad a15 could go quad a9 1.0 gigahertz original engine variant built internally refer r4 custom developed arm basically cortex a9 clocked 2.3 gigahertz sweet spot believe perf per square millimeter translate term price phone enabling well target everything kind look market least similar look strategy analytics market research firm look anything like 200 299 super phone address discrete gpu large segment market believe opening u 99 199 range market quite low end low end kind currently addressed company like mediatek 99 199 segment u qualcomm q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor fully capable lte smart phone price point right fully mean basically looking sweet spot market next year 1080p lte smart phone okay great question audience inaudible sorry talk r investment profile clearly lot investment thing like kepler tegra right inaudible et cetera mean know got past peak r investment profile yes good question mean get question opex last year grew opex targeted 1.4 billion came underneath basically spent exactly said spend q1 opex went pretty much exactly expected earnings call recently articulated reason bringing lte market absolutely right thing term r expense project currently plate funded r project obviously know built shield last year example paying engineer build last year term kepler shield grid lte product basically product funded last year opex increase q1 largely based taking lte market mean time think general look profile opex percentage revenue think last four year see pretty consistently right around 31 time grown operating income considerably operating income four year ago opex 31 percentage revenue q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participantbut operating income 8 grew 20 yes spent every year term percentage revenue stayed pretty ﬂat grown income quite bit time yes going let joe pick guy typically pretty reluctant talk project denver wondering view maybe big picture wise arm server market segment think guy best capability play sort broad brush give u first assumption correct yes talking lot project denver right think relatively shortly mean thing disclosed talked thing probably already know think secret power important thing cell phone battery think people know exaﬂop initiative initiative build exaﬂop supercomputer year 2018 number one technical obstacle building supercomputer power anyone familiar supercomputer server data center market know power major obstacle hurdle achieving breakthrough obviously invested lot computing parallel computing cuda lot experience deploying supercomputer guy know q3 launched titan world fastest supercomputer driven 18,000 gpus obviously segment market care lot today implementation x86 disclosed working something called project denver product thing said general purpose cpu somebody somebody started propagating information oh going go general purpose cpu business mean nvidia never never never general purpose cpu typically going go find diﬃcult problem build something custom solve problem typically diﬃcult whole lot talking yet hopefully soon april stuff would come rob csongor q joe moore rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor q unidentified participant rob csongor know honest answer think upcoming gpu technology conference going hear lot grid think right term milestone new opportunity nvidia obviously enough right grid one think lot people interested already generating revenue already kind well along alpha customer time u talk business probably coming time one okay look quadro workstation business relationship big boy coming competition think pretty high margin business surprise upside think okay big boy talking mean biggest boy world biggest boy world know intel showed interest oh tesla business yes oh yes okay sorry thought said quadro q joe moore rob csongor q joe moore rob csongorso question tesla right okay continue believe tesla business represents great growth opportunity nvidia relatively slow developing new paradigm new way compute early adopter tesla business predominantly lot university supercomputer case custom work people basically revenue lumpy installation kind installation done revenue drop may noticed last quarter done titan installation revenue went quite go way difference starting develop business definition business designer designing landing gear open newest version ansys one standard physical simulation product bought dell poweredge server something like simply accelerated tesla without knowing software hardware know mean write code develop code think seeing pickup run rate business intel coming market first course validates market u think intel anything unless think big potential market think simply ca ignore benefit computing think help u help u validate market meantime six seven year code writing think competition catch unfortunately wrap time okay thanks much rob appreciate right thanks lot thanks joe
