counterpart cfo microsoft please welcome amy hood stage okay thanks john inaudible right glad got heater ... maybe yes turn well yes planned conference goal 2 force nature come winter amy hood glad made amy thank taking time really really mean lot u agreed keynote inaugural conference came standing freezing like think almost turned heat yes question answer get thing started shocker might want talk azure commercial cloud oﬃce 365 start obviously guy adjusted goal 20 billion arr commercial cloud said two year ago actually hit target early faster anticipated guess question kind start thing like see growth trending coming year obviously going faster expected yes think couple thing set target april may two year ago think certainly understanding tam expansion opportunity knew good amount confidence oﬃce 365 transition would look like saw talk people close thought installed base would move thought within installed base would transition cloud two year would say portion unknown think many way u bigger question quickly transition customer side would happen felt pretty confident could execute azure competitive interesting story differentiated one including fact committed hybrid q philip alan winslow amy e. hoodfrom beginning architecture u think pacing market think thing gone pretty quickly customer side term even heard john talk important well fargo hundred hundred story think pacing probably bigger surprise feel good execution obviously much market opportunity execution line got well let break sort 2 bucket commercial cloud start first oﬃce talked call guess almost two year ago think oﬃce 365 subscription growth outpacing sort offsetting decline license side let think question get lot `` like azure oﬃce license oﬃce 365 azure replacement also lot net expansion think term sort like forward growth process yes always explained fundamentally different transition oﬃce 365 even designed pricing model 7 eight year ago different job oﬃce cfo go long world view term oﬃce oﬃce really opportunity seat business sell something seat opportunity say going transition license subscription pretty clear certain number information worker world know one meet today license know one new seat knew one transition transitioning seat could easily say going 2 driver going installed base growth new seat able reach paid model going transition customer ultimately would lead arpu expansion possibility one think transition quite clear take one seat move happened paid upfront got pay 3 four year math pretty clean term able predict look like distinction azure actually think seeing u others seeing growth cloud growth people decide want run infrastructure including investment made past u look like particularly sql even window continued license growth even `` transition transition really people continuing add investment technology bucket spend digitize whatever process whether business process marketing environment sale kind go list think bring people back singular kpi really indifferent long meet customer need infrastructure platform buy license buy azure stuff one thing cared differently year think past really focused azure consumption opposed billing cycle important distinction always recognize revenue based consumption get recognize revenue selling something really focusing q philip alan winslow amy e. hood q philip alan winslowthat motion customer make sure successful really important pivot taken yes actually maybe double click second obviously made change sale force incentivize focus consumption talked earnings call sort deeper customer relationship know customer think process almost like bit culture change pushing product speak sale team would ever pushing product actually focusing consumption put sale force model well think let break couple thing done sale force year started really july largest sale force change certainly long company week 15 year shocking time ﬂies fun guess really fundamentally change go market customer type high end meant adding lot resource technical say technical mean would probably see distinction someone work redmond writing line code typical fully capable implementing project cost cost meaning effort capable getting project ground capable demoing deep azure functionality type person someone frankly microsoft used way tended use type person type talent either service business consulting arm obviously one engineering team large investment meant fundamentally consumption people paid paid selling contract azure booking paid customer successful meaning get project running meter start spinning azure get rewarded think life cycle making customer successful absolutely start invest technical expertise help journey pick right project matter show roi effort get project speed see person rewarded successful outcome pretty wedded concept different way rewarding people cleanly aligned structurally customer success ultimately business customer success matter build time got inaudible well let focus back oﬃce second going make statement going read statement want tell sort right wrong oﬃce 365 might halfway past point term adoption 50 installed base microsoft still early stage migration premium skus i.e e1 e2 sorry e3 e5 maybe even e7 one day going last next 5 10 year right wrong statement amy e. hood q philip alan winslow amy e. hood right structurally would say model seat business particular like one move customer active directory deployed recent service general churn go ultimately raise effective pricing sku transition people continue build product customer see benefit product move tend move sku tiering ton customer need functionality inaudible ton finding right place logic correct build reason tends longer tail simply accounting tend sign agreement time actually get everybody cycle new sku finally asp lift fully implemented across spectrum tends come come slowly tends pretty consistent trajectory got let stick oﬃce ecosystem talk linkedin acquisition obviously big deal microsoft thinking folding linkedin strategy year sort going forward think number one let start incredibly pleased gone year next week week since closed transaction ahead every financial target set feel good employee pleased meaning happier used actually terrific thing term retention employee thrilled seen bit revenue reacceleration talked last quarter result see thing feel good strong start incredibly important decision made important financial investment made way start see already seen little thing frankly think get used little bit one start see integration experience whether going word seeing linkedin integration resume building whether sale navigator integration crm solution social selling whether maybe incremental hr effort linkedin sell existing customer base think see really functioning thoughtful sale team really fine bumping little bit work actually fine way instead trying jam 2 sale force together let disrupt basically customer momentum made active choice ton example buy company integrate sale force one certainly given momentum think really unique attribute see show across oﬃce across dynamic within linkedin tangible side wo probably see large moment really linkedin culture much anymore see thoughtful integration customer care show product every month q philip alan winslow amy e. hood q philip alan winslow amy e. hood inaudible okay spent fair amount time revenue side commercial cloud oﬃce mean one thing jumped last quarter outside hitting 20 billion arr jump commercial cloud gross margin 500 bps 800 bps one question got much related let say mix oﬃce 365 azure mix shift call standard service premium premium service within ... actually pretty clean mostly azure oﬃce continued gross margin improvement fact service last quarter whether dynamic underlyings mix shift think azure highest grower mix shift azure yet still seeing gross margin get better one math pretty clean azure gross margin improvement part premium service mix part also cost per cost infrastructure improvement across hardware software work feel good team effort proud last quarter think many reason think felt like every earnings call would get asked pejoratively margin structure said kind 6 quarter ago expected material gross margin last year q1 think feel like `` hi going stop asking said `` well keep going let know yes great guess okay scale important part obviously azure think scrolling forward obviously got premium skus 365 got new premium service azure scale azure think gross margin commercial cloud going forward put take really getting continued improvement one spend lot time component talk commercial cloud gross margin cleanest way revenue think one big cloud business look like scale actual management technique quite different team work quite differently want focus oﬃce 365 margin get dynamic margin get service linkedin ultimately linkedin clean amwork 82 83 84 mean pretty structurally margin business go look azure premium service layer manage toward goal outcome matter mix revenue ultimately exists continue believe room grow really makeup revenue look like see going forward azure continue grow piece put structural downward pressure see probably continue increase want see pricing competitiveness standpoint q philip alan winslow amy e. hood q philip alan winslow right well spent lot time talking oﬃce azure want switch gear little business called window think microsoft might known one thing really struck past several quarter look growth window revenue versus pc market mean microsoft excluded pc market get similar thing get question client saying `` okay attached piracy asp mix shift towards premium skus sustainable maybe walk u going driven outperformance think going forward let put window business 2 thing funny name pro let call commercial consumer effectively moment commercial pc business otherwise known pro general outperformed market bit tends little bit attach pro little bit better one vary terribly far market might usually comment could stuff like quarter bit pre buy pro number little high couple point come back people would ask `` know well many buyer pc license world see move little bit funny pattern kind guess got couple week inventory specific oem one see move far commercial pc long period time kind grower mean even exception year couple year back `` end xp get new computer moment outside steady steady macro change steady even different region kind low single digit consumer side far volatile quarter first time actually consumer business tends bigger asp difference skus consumer business commercial business commercial business got 2 different tend ton asp movement commercial consumer tend see big asp difference device pretty healthy higher end market see happen tends mean higher asp associated see big delta unit look like revenue look like give opposite unit strong happened couple year ago opposite true see revenue far unit growth tends pricing tier anything else wide difference pricing based think based price device device spec think shift device think low price think lot power think high one consumer got obviously oﬃce 365 phenomenal success think everybody tent would agree walk u opportunity well microsoft oﬃce 365 opportunity amy e. hood q philip alan winslow amy e. hood microsoft 365 think realization customer perspective want modern experience machine second whatever machine modern experience defined characteristic would importantly many cio ctos would modern security plan modern management tool like sorry could hear well nice thinking modern security modern management people tend think oﬃce window quite separately well em product actually built cloud enterprise division really experience modern workplace modern desktop modern even phone experience oﬃce foundationally capability come oﬃce 365 finally said well sell thing customer actually ask u `` wait secure environment would say well window 10 oﬃce 365 combination deployed together secure component started call thing microsoft 365 would also world refer device modern natural language ability understanding natural input like gesture gaze take 10 input think broadest sense word wanted modern computing experience wanted interact device either normal keyboarding touch time whether gaze whether voice whether ink attribute application sit modern device find historically certain apps optimized ink certain apps want terrific modern experience apps o device optimized really make meaningful difference think computing think microsoft 365 think broadest inclusive consistent experience application o build including device spec yes made comment device sort whatever thinking say ﬂashback build obviously keynote intelligent edge talking containerization micro service device car thermostat link back azure iot edge opportunity obviously hear iot hear intelligent device microsoft play sort bring table say maybe competitor well say endpoint people still want secure manageable endpoint especially going collect amount sensing data want able update secured want story u window 10 story well azure iot story around connectivity device back data source feel actually quite good investment made think iot endpoint say edge think broadest term right whether pc right way interpret whether phone whether sensor q philip alan winslow amy e. hood q philip alan winslow amy e. hood q philip alan winslow amy e. hoodfrankly whether edge network would say compute need reside need reside application work best even azure stack right even azure stack another way talking edge u think pretty world view think specific product product make possible run compute ass data capture data analyze data matter environment right think could gaming may need close although latency time getting good enough may need case azure stack realization always cruise ship best visualization people understand clearly connected good way think important compute need got got bunch question going ask one open audience richard hoping could associate could grab mic people raise hand walk around one question thinking asked year sort life cycle operational eﬃciency microsoft mean think everybody room agrees past guess year guess 18 quarter think cfo going 18th quarter ... yes know could count ... yes finished 18 going 19 yes let keep streak alive think operational eﬃciencies kind talked life cycle first part focusing cost structure spending much thing need divested period allocation call le note inaudible sort area hit point started fade kind inched

thing said really picking business first one business change market change competitive landscape change suddenly maybe something q philip alan winslow amy e. hoodmake much sense used still watch make sure make sense right lot would say right business feel like behind u next piece really continuing focus eﬃcient done ton work think maybe easier approach would say one pretty focused still like every company earth opportunity reinvent many process digitally eﬃcient build software ship software sell software hardware feel like still opportunity run eﬃcient operation fundamentally eﬃciency customer experience better tell people time eﬃciency work focused making better customer outcome whether many commerce system need company recognize call many different customer interface want modern build environment engineer thing matter customer whether internal employee whether external customer pay u money benefit thoughtful eﬃcient work opposed saying `` oh see cost cut good frame successful company tend also think bit investor year key place true year think look intelligent cloud search investment feel great paying top line long see thing pay top line really feel constrained term
