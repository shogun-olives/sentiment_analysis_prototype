sort line april quarter guidance gave know lot weakness happened walk u much slowdown macro much structural much temporary think investor trying figure pleased performance q1 given lot macro condition still able execute planned q vivek arya colette kressthe quarter macro condition quite unique saw tremendous movement euro currency period time moved 20 25 point within four month time coupled fx rate also saw quite different change environment term demand overall pc see lot provider asia talk tremendous decline overall pc market two thing coupled together really changed buying behavior occurring one addressed differently gaming market ended q1 talked strong still expect strong sure gamers really look fx rate sometimes want game think pc platform necessarily pc whether workstation pc going effected q2 strongest quarter u overall seasonality believe macro condition effecting q2 excited overall market position leadership technology could stronger front exciting thing coming second half whether holiday season virtual reality 4k continued growth accelerated computing q2 going wait see play got come back pc gaming side wanted run three important question get spoke q2 second intel royalty agreement important part ongoing eps initial agreement done intel think perception settlement component right component agreement get close probability get renewed investor thing important part valuing nvidia term yes think investor sitting analyst standpoint helping guide investor think number one focus step back look entire ip strategy versus single let call deal term pipeline ip strategy focused royalty related significant amount patent portfolio later month play itc latter half june itc hearing qualcomm samsung working close six month pleased term progress already seen trial work get started pretrial close markman decision six seven construction argument put forth think anybody going deny great progress excited see play court later month think lot different part industry carefully watching overall hearing think important space talking mobile unit q vivek arya colette kress q vivek arya colette kress q vivek aryawe talking gpus pretty found every single mobile unit right monetization underlying ip recognized mobile unit would put concentration watching trial outcome expect hear hearing first part october think take step got one press little bit intel royalty thing revenue getting right play much mobile side right use lot graphic lot product conceptually think term potential renewal whenever agreement end look company nvidia continues innovate innovate graphic technology essentially leader graphic technology amount patent know case entire 7,000 plus patent chose seven make discussion one patent probably important term entire portfolio true architectural type patent know best engineer right world focused gpus life work working nvidia think waiting helping see importance technology value current hearing probably key focus one payment right known intel well known also recognition revenue full year even final question litigation outlined 70 million 90 million expense think one year expense continue 70 million 90 million think look extraordinary amount wanted make sure investor clearly understood cost litigation cost putting best foot forward offense well defense side occurred extraordinary meaning believe underlying part run rate overall opex expect going forward quarter die die nearly nothing believe enter fiscal year start see third frequent question icera wind outline think 100 million 125 million restructuring type expense colette kress q vivek arya colette kress q vivek arya colette kress q vivek aryashould think saving opex assume able sell division currently working process either wind icera and/or finding sale icera business going work current quarter q2 outlined restructuring event associated severance many asset physical asset well tax asset associated business likely play next several quarter exact quarter term restructuring occur still unknown time think forward term opex already probably halfway year nearing halfway year icera benefit term underlying cost icera slowly come book key important growth opportunity extremely strategic u also competitive u automotive business could competitive talked accelerated computing also competitive want make sure set success reinvestment business either wind sell overall icera hope better term returning bottom line next couple quarter still going process see believe said opex sort ﬂattish incremental litigation expense right correct look opex going forward correct pc gaming go back end market talk amd coming new product think every year talk new product anything different year worry competitive landscape colette kress q vivek arya colette kress q vivek arya colette kress also announced computex week new offering maxwell architecture gaming well announced 980 ti feeding market today amd recognize duopoly understand coming new line product seen yet product overall gaming market well engineered innovative market great leadership position keep watch amd put forward pleased term review acceptance well also revenue growth seen term product date part gaming also investing lot shield product somewhat unique nvidia semiconductor company actually coming product like shield game console whether medium center part strategy making box good question way think gaming today seen pc gaming important part market last 20 year seeing move mobile term notebook going need also move cloud move forward rich experience pc capable cloud environment important understand market well understand customer understand need best position provide cloud platform whether game whether recognizing tv platform well based android one fastest used operating system growth see worldwide taking market know pc platform included pc overall use forum gamers manner well colette niche thing know asus somebody else amazon somebody else take look say yes real market scale nvidia really want scale sort showing proof concept early stage bringing thing market see lot interest excitement pretty powerful platform performance user interface think hitting market well think early indicate would involvement current partner may evolve still great thing appreciate bringing market today q vivek arya colette kress q vivek arya colette kress q vivek arya colette kress q vivek arya lastly gaming side selling expensive card noticed great value card yes yes high value card thanks correction seeing though seen fx important factor asp product high opposed see intel cpu example see gpus high dollar value card see much 0.40 analog part example fx volatility still ongoing think sort baked current thinking still risk factor well think especially russia right place enjoy nice rate russia astronomical change economic environment bar none think anything unaffected market pretty hard thing overcome continue normal day given lot thing happened course found gaming continue strong even market may volatility pricing make decision maybe set store buy higher priced one left maybe something slightly le still gaming think important still seeing value importance platform entertainment still affordable entertainment think type form gaming could come inclusive gpu platform game want surprise u definitely withstands volatility market also based leadership technology put forth guy lot work term taking gpu cloud make sure cannibalize existing business colette kress q vivek arya colette kress q vivek arya referring overall grid virtualized grid opportunity workstation one one powerful experience overall assessment thinking using application cloud need overall workstation answer think seeing overall need share work collaborative form able done anything workstation screen got somebody lined behind got figure print get overall worldwide global collaboration capable grid environment see exactly seeing design rendering could powerful think right seeing expansion tam associated virtualization going forward business model going forward grid also powerful well talking continuous software update necessary software layer enables overall virtualization think early stage necessarily cannibalization mean expansion allowing people access way track milestone number trial number trial converted revenue dashboard make sure good investment yes dashboard definitely key kpis look volume trial continues go particularly launch vsphere vmware general availability versus beta version technology meaning order enable vgpu talking virtualization software leader incorporating latest version u term generating market demand generating market lead work together term implementing lot excitement could stronger term seeing market great enterprise take time roll platform everyone always belief enterprise couple different application list high many one key feature vmware vsphere saw latest launch could happier technology enabling virtualization maybe one question automotive business something used small people believe turning real number think nvidia versus say texas instrument freescale many company provide processor go automotive market make nvidia unique fair think always colette kress q vivek arya colette kressthe high end market would go mass market think overall strategy auto good discussion automotive business eight ten year working design win across many different oem manufacturer million car 7 million road automotive business different pace different form see term lot technology design may win safety regulation take time actually get manufacturer car began best term car visual computing run many infotainment system central dashboard many car see road starting high end could better place start solved problem expensive car planet ability work lot easier standardized moved many form factor many version audi bmw tesla honda europe gulf volkswagen bentleys lamborghinis car son want powerful platform made term infotainment discussion term competitor exciting part market everybody want see car much technology literally wear u right use every single day addressing market really serve market best probably already 50 microprocessor within car see type looking adding one two microprocessor together removing one call innovation guess starting overall drive platform launched earlier year really focusing central compute platform car plug play add may need today may need five year may need future able take learning high performance computing deep neural network medical imaging exact type problem focus car going around car identify street sign dog squirrel want information great learning complex data problem processer depth pulling together relationship already strong car could better position nvidia average content car ballpark q vivek arya colette kressit depends car midline car going yes may one processor right car many higher end car one two potentially four different processor running car front dashboard center console two entertainment back talk audi a7 term potential multiple different processers car depending manufacturer want implement well value software build accordance oems want increase overall price point value able realize let pause see question audience let keep going look last year guess especially since joined nvidia done good job gross margin course controlling cost question tied gross margin one hand nvidia benefited mix product right would say also 28 nanometer use getting better across foundry partner perhaps also helped process look next one two year right everyone talk increasing content moore law right fewer foundry build advanced product guy need lot transistor think cost structure evolving see challenge cost manufacturing perspective longstanding relationship current foundry partner even advancement new foundry partner done foundry supply probably peak term choice anybody go benefit u one keep u toe term different process different cost structure different relationship formed nothing change every day long decision working many year think new product coming market think new node new process need cost one component overall gross margin continue balance right cost right process multiple foundry think make great decision made already overall foundry partner value see even stem past hardware gross margin inﬂuenced ability serve platform customer platform surround ecosystem software overall programmability programming language thing added overall value product delivering customer recognized solving extremely challenging problem talked term investor day think growth opportunity whether gaming whether accelerated computing enterprise virtualization gross margin q vivek arya colette kress q vivek arya colette kress q vivek aryaequal higher overall company average right rare company strategic alignment expanding growing tam well area expanding gross margin excited excited thing going forward last question minute available last call also decided raise dividend increase amount buyback given weakness seeing end market temporary came somewhat positive surprise could go little bit drove decision yes capital return program underlying tenet shareholder value provide shareholder continuous review term right size need keep given overall cash balance need overall cash able separate growth overall p l underlying cash balance need increase yes time increase dividend make competitive dividend yield well thinking need us cash pleased actually raise 800 million fiscal year terrific think still one minute left let run last question important question wanted get operating margin analyst day set specific target right business model perspective ca assume nvidia point excluding royalty get high teen 20 type operating margin prevent getting nothing prevent term error positive negative setting actual number hit certain period time focus really driving growth strategy know tremendous monetization capability great business model go timing one really tough play crystal ball every cfo would want able pin easily focus focus profitability focus margin gross operating margin move new business model moving operating margin versus focus gross margin semiconductor look really want transform focus pinpointed exact number exact date actually get colette kressgreat thank much colette appreciate time thank
