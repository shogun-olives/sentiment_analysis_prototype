hello welcome fourth annual well fargo tmt summit name phil winslow software analyst well fargo excited one favorite company company joining u microsoft longtime tom fannon ph obviously big fan azure looking note think 10th anniversary azure bowl excited welcome julia white corporate vice president azure marketing julia thanks joining u glad thanks question answer question answer cool well kick thing wondered could thanks everyone webcast tell u little bit background role responsibility microsoft absolutely microsoft almost 20 year long time past six year leading azure server product marketing kind thing azure cloud service well thing like window server sql server visual studio developer tool chain well julia whitefair fun stuff stuff love great conversation guess 2020 guy far think back april fiscal q3 earnings call satya noted seen two year digital transformation first two month pandemic 10 month pandemic believe cio strategy whereby cloud substantially become going forward least using two question talk impact azure evolved past 10 month customer partner telling yes know wild ride least mean first stepping back seeing working customer already moved cloud already done lot work around digital capability super clear able agile adjust adapt happened idea digital transformation important digital capability think learned really matter bit test pressure test frankly whether proven true definitely seen term agility ability switch meet customer demand changing definitely different term overall trend seeing one lot urgency cloud everyone cloud plan like cloud urgency much bigger right dabbling long plan like bigger faster certainly true lot agility go scale lot customer like wish could scale quickly movement recognizing lot cost management cost optimized run server little capacity long run lot type opportunity also need lot better capability thing like real time analytics rapid app development needed cloud needed cloud lot shift talk specific think thing people always ask like cloud adoption happen faster sooner like culture like people norm maybe dramatic thing changed covid right around norm culture whatever reason want move faster kind blown away think going one durable shift seen continue increase durable time course say people like inaudible azure revenue going spite watching glad consumption take time project start whether migration new approximately start small grow time incredible strength growth see increase project size project increasing go think last bit looked different industry impacted high impacted industry certainly cloud adoption fell right cost optimized thing impact industry impacted absolutely spiked kind bounced q philip winslow julia whiteand actually seeing even high impacted industry come back normal rate starting see level exactly mean talking quote mike tyson went mind `` everybody plan get punched face sort feel like cloud migration digital transformation plan oh gosh whatever plan need accelerate guess least next question sort prioritization digital transformation talk seeing project creation project prioritization perspective customer evolved expect u evolve future past 10 month price azure yes pull apart say couple thing change dramatically right away term prioritization virtual desktop right service around window virtual desktop absolutely spiked everyone went home needed working remotely along team obviously microsoft team adoption virtual desktop team integration work together saw grow project underway become quickly number one project similarly security like always hacker never waste good crisis around covid saw lot new different kind attack different kind technique used saw bunch azure security kind broader enterprise mobility security capability put place quickly particularly remote work everyone done network security endpoint security needed place certainly became top priority project perspective third one within mix suddenly became urgent around rapid business process change right line business system way work suddenly need involve really quickly microsoft technology called microsoft power apps take way build application became favorite tool choice whether hospital trying track ppe really quickly retailer moving curbside pickup remote checking inaudible check type experiencing starbucks mobile pick app able way really quickly maybe nurse hospital figuring process versus needing professional developer big push around integrating azure capability whether data service inaudible service github power apps beautiful kind professional developer low code experience based urgency certainly big one think question changed maybe continuing strong pace analytics modernization analytics much underway underway lot people still sitting old legacy system keeping covid put pressure right people like used q philip winslow julia white q philip winslow julia whiteto fine got 60 day 90 day old data like way need like 12 hour data past forecasting model need evolve use analytics getting modern analytics continued quite strong expect one actually even continue accelerate move forward certainly hot area steady run right business migration existing system hybrid used case think steady state certainly saw lot people quickly move back possessed recovering cloud kind run rate migration cost optimization super strong describe two gateway drive cloud disaster inaudible recovery business continuity need risk mitigation perspective potentially use capacity maybe cheaper done better maybe talk production workload yes nice cultural norm culturally easy way kind start journey right common exactly sure microsoft market perspective used gateway drug ph analyst good inaudible switching gear little bit inaudible still obviously azure think investor always much solely focused sort headline azure growth number always say much love perspective exciting emerging critical underappreciated part azure portfolio yes vast portfolio love question jump would say though first well everyone love azure number important appreciate right overall commercial cloud business 15 billion last quarter grew 30 thing want start azure core part world microsoft cloud right across microsoft 365 dynamic 365 platform github course underpinning azure think seeing u mentioned integration github power apps azure coming together create experience seeing still provide integrated solution customer think certainly something exciting emerging maybe still appreciated three thing really keeping eye towards microsoft cloud growth microsoft cloud experience first thing might speak within azure specifically get exciting emerging underappreciated break say let start critical underappreciated azure sql big business place customer really look u thing strong taken third year old database engine perfected secured azure even edge amazing capability eﬃciency skill system used anywhere build distributed application distributed system certainly key key opportunity around azure mentioned window virtual desktop vdi inaudible huge percentage people existing data center footprint vi opportunity modernize move capable platform run cost effectively certainly big piece kind underappreciated area maybe think exciting category analytics long time coming level like place modernized moment moving true cloud native analytic system seeing thing like azure announce ph azure power bi bring together opportunity actual business fact much like microsoft cfo care much business leader care unlocks organizational actually making much better informed decision database culture another area building would ai right mean much opportunity seeing long journey ai really seeing phenomenal breakthrough looking latest image recognition technology kind used go say `` oh look two people talking webcast literally say age gender amazing thinking many different use case whether help working people visually impaired navigating world really starting see responsible ai aspect right transparency model data protection around model reducing bias category thing think exciting one emerging category thing keep eye future would say mixed reality place long mixed reality like seen ai kind ... thing something part every single application expect mixed reality thing right going element mixed reality need mixed reality almost application get easier cloud service make native device like hololens others expand become accessible everybody think underway long time start see going really take industrial side thing digital twin idea kind next generation shift iot right connected thing essentially taking connected environment whole system understanding system connected thing work together optimize q philip winslow julia white q philip winslow julia whiteyou run greater inside understand overall environment connected part last least certainly massively profound quantum right 14 year quantum computing investment amazingly enough 14 year building software language development sdks simulation engine getting ready quantum compute capability well fact saw inaudible head technology kick today one thing talking frankly since got every time interviewed sort increasingly excited hey quantum yet getting closer sort pillar foundational layer put place actually received white paper bank thing quantum could mean yes definitely thought okay maybe put azure number yet excited nonetheless maybe interesting even one quantum simulation engine running quantum algorithm classical computer cpu gpu actually seeing like remarkable breakthrough working hospital mri recognition like massive improvement even though simulating interesting yes lot potential yet number yes exactly fascinating algorithm inaudible put category stay tuned obviously walked broad portfolio guess question thinking invest microsoft framework growth operating investment meeting especially context azure revenue think see increasing investment area may see deep harvesting potentially okay maybe inaudible back second look overall azure total addressable market 4.5 trillion like massive scratching surface always remind ourself still ton growth core business right around compute system like hybrid cloud solution running big sap erp system cloud high performance computing network security lot growth potential investment frankly core part business still healthy healthy part increased perspective referenced analytics lot investment machine learning two evolving really maturing broad tam expect get big work force overall move forward new area like moved operator helping telecom communication operator acquired metaswitch q philip winslow julia white q philip winslow julia whitefirm network space well big investment really helping segment run optimize digital world like industry moving digital transformation operator space working right whether 4g 5g beyond helping modernize also kind increased investment area overall cloud native app development lot organization tweaking modernizing migrating application really like like need move full cloud native application capability like container kubernetes adding ai service application really meaningful way like application leveraging ai next five year going relevant going deeper code drifting optimizing certainly radar investment perspective actually iot edge perspective actually four year ago announced kind 5 billion investment going spanned five year coming tail last year place belong well inaudible three year ago coin like intelligent cloud intelligent edge pattern investment think well ahead market continuing important secular change lot prioritize azure good problem problem many growth opportunity going wait versus one going go big versus per se obviously mentioned edge mean really wrote inaudible came well fargo january three half year ago like hey think next platform shift coming know called exactly calling fog micro fog remember sudden like sure think going big sitting build sudden intelligent cloud intelligent edge like yes like first better branding micro fog like maybe crazy satya even stage bill talking excited actually pointing network side thought also going sort natural extension edge role 5g operator edge called cloud world kind glue absolutely yes piece come together right yet start see pattern know cloud edge really simple term application pattern q philip winslow julia white q philip winslow julia white q philip winslownetworking capability make feasible interesting compelling way yes mean actually already sometimes networking actually driver sometimes platform shift computing think actually enable probably ethernet connectivity lay driver platform bottom one yes exactly work together want double click something mentioned earlier hybrid cloud mold like mine offspin ph would say original board case 10 year ago microsoft amazing relationship customer premise also extending cloud azure portability called code tool process people cloud customer increasingly embraced cloud think growth offering hybrid come play yes stated always held premise cloud edge durable right technology premise incredibly important whether big server whether small device right continue invest server create modern experience like example azure stack hci window server based capability perfect modernizing prem system bringing footprint like cloud capability disaster recovery backup type thing bridging two world actually made great stat 1/3 window server sql server enterprise customer using hybrid benefit deploy azure right fantastic benefit give value software assurance agreement server also give benefit cloud right one capability aws actually five time expensive azure running window server sql server huge customer benefit well technology part also business model part support well ensure customer value holistically yes one word think probably biggest change may impactful change best called 12 24 month word multi simply hybrid cloud future couple question seeing field top reason customer strategy shifting julia white q philip winslowto think implication azure particular sort defend mode world yes new term think new reality right new term marketing person like new term customer get get common thing see acquisition right one cloud strategy acquired different cloud strategy come together super super common level like want one vendor going distribute cloud capability put lot would say much strategic decision kind happened developer chose data science team like tend project project decision might run sap system one cloud data science project another cloud based individual group decided mostly talked cio ctos kind happened discovered versus super intentional look exactly look like data center 40 year like hey never homogeneous lot different system lot different tool despite people best intention heterogeneous world always best breed best kind dynamic think cloud going lot different right think think view frankly hybrid recognizes view everything wo sit one big cloud one try take history really understanding hybrid might working across different environment seamless fashion making people run two environment next think great wisdom bring bear infrastructure perspective azure stack long time literally bring azure infrastructure anywhere moved software layer may technology called azure arc essentially enables software capability cloud run anywhere well matching infra software data service developer service also move around today exciting thing customer like great run cloud like common starting see like think run azure sql different cloud compute okay lot different reason reality enterprise customer complicated lot nuance ﬂexibility yes definitely mean even going back virtual bill 2020 lot buzz around azure wanted spend moment maybe help investor understand sort azure arc important touch little bit enable customer kind moving forward julia white q philip winslow julia white yes glad asked bit complicated area right people like talking azure break two thing right first thing azure arc literally take management control plane policy kind manage virtual machine service extends azure use manage resource azure use extend anywhere way manage sits premise system manages system run aws example extends azure management plan setting policy globally selling resource allocation globally first part management plan extends enables second thing call arc enable azure software managed service run management plan mean wherever arc presides take azure service azure sql database azure postgresql database azure kubernetes service also run wherever want comment like hey want run edge device location right want run want distributed model want put data service sitting different cloud type ﬂexibility enables core make real conceptually inaudible one world largest medical equipment supplier right done use azure arc deploy update consistently scale azure medical equipment distributed world right pandemic needed quickly update imaging diagnostic equipment type thing could remotely way get manage one place across system right well got five minute left let shift edge mentioned earlier big fan edge stuff give u update think intelligent ai sort life cycle intelligent agent think opportunity microsoft azure yes mean think talked early idea becoming bit new normal thinking like hard think application built today combination cloud edge technology right maybe people talk way think way manufacturing plant right connected system course using cloud data analytics even like big company work gas pump fuel station connected check safety someone smoking pumping gas like kind thing edge compute working q philip winslow julia whitecloud compute retail shelf notify people stock cloud edge contactless delivery system smart appliance thing example cloud edge application pattern code sitting edge device lot code sitting cloud working concert think way evolves networking part 5g emerges get become capable really latency requirement well also another two point unlocking next step function think maturity edge device maturity certainly happening help trying help industry thing like azure sphere security even mcu device ability run full ai model small device getting high performance getting secure getting cheap unlocks edge part cloud perspective right investment iot service ai service thing like azure arc make possible say mainstream thing pretty much kind new normal move forward yes kind feel like becoming real mean every time thinking year sort unveiled azure inaudible edge intelligent edge sort example drone scanning pipeline looking crack like starting see year later sort seeing evolved hear example drone forum africa stage build actually really happening real life pretty incredible one question one thing talk potentially sort company almost like three tier model potentially evolving got centralized via cloud azure got device decided azure ph maybe like running inaudible also talked sort like edge internet go back kind network question could point think called distributed footprint obviously talked hyperscale come azure also think device maybe enough compute power centralized cloud image late something kind think sort distributive footprint azure relative let say edge cdn vendor might yes well certainly seen u continue expand global region 60 slowing multiple reason one beyond serve customer locally sit performance perspective also data set data privacy data governance capability also become increasingly important driver really catalyst continued global expansion broad region world going important part certainly work q philip winslow julia white q philip winslow julia whitepartnership operator even today edge zone term working operator around edge zone u edge zone continuing expand even region look like certainly continue see well well okay got two minute could pas opportunity ask question obviously seen every reason inaudible market azure inaudible play xbox exercise microsoft strategy call content king game pas maybe talk inaudible play role yes well mean xbox possible azure awesome one microsoft thing gaming perspective vision reach 3 billion gamers planet want make azure platform best building game developer right like building next fantastic game xbox kind game streaming experience xbox game past leveraging azure behind obviously make azure better even thing like xbox game studio minecraft halo gear war built using azure make azure even capable also help refine think offer game streaming perspective place first party gaming area actually wonderful kind synergy platform powering underneath interesting thing super useful gaming high performance low latency application planet right people gamers tolerance zero really push platformer really push azure also great want run nasdaq cloud gosh similar type type requirement transferable benefit broader industry versus gaming right awesome well super informative 30 minute went fast touched lot thing thankfully u talk pretty fast able cover lot julia thank joining u virtually like said super informative talking awesome thank much
