brad zelnick software analyst crãƒâ©dit suisse truly delighted u today jason zander microsoft corporation software keynote morning jason executive vice president microsoft azure business microsoft since 1992 started engineering azure think ran visual studio business correct question answer really really excited get comfortable format today presentation going fireside chat going see learn microsoft effort public cloud jason maybe open get note know wanted ask microsoft mission statement quite bold every time open filing listen satya speak reminded empower every person every organization planet achieve think boundless opportunity relates azure unique azure best enables deliver bold vision yes thank brad today well good morning everybody would say several thing would point want start azure perspective really push hybrid hybrid something made part product plan since day 1 come fact 20 year experience providing software data center data center enterprise environment done hyperscale q brad alan zelnick jason zandercloud really great solution done everything full spread hybrid also broad portfolio going even beyond azure course oï¬ƒce 365 think one us directory identity security et cetera product come together microsoft cloud look oï¬ƒce 365 dynamic identity underpins thing compose well last thing would say even really technical differentiator software company one key thing always tell potential customer partner competition help support world think lot customer talk want get technology one hand provider provider turn around compete another u core breadth hybrid differentiator think resonate excellent think global presence 54 global region largest presence marketplace understand think various data center comprise region think driving success theoretical limit number region expect think decision expand different area one kind region gotten cloud well mean 54 region worldwide big hyperscale region run big workload order get close possible potential customer well employee able region around world super important also region count help u thing like data sovereignty think history cloud one key reason need oï¬ƒce 365 one first big commercial saas service popular one today turn people sharepoint document et cetera need close need kind coverage done worldwide thing since day 1 think retailer serving couple market really need start smaller footprint search need full coverage fact even bing really 5 region around world run bing full coverage shredding internet searching laugh loud cat need worry one luxembourg right basically service way history kind rooted one way chose differentiate needed recognized customer isvs worldwide reach needed theoretical limit right 54 region one announced underway disclosed yet expect u continue point probably need put data center every single location would cost prohibitive good solution region like european union u.k. brexit thing like well move thing like azure stack allow people get last mile want one basement parliament hook q brad alan zelnick jason zander q brad alan zelnick jason zander helpful jason think capex investment think everybody many room look listen carefully microsoft allocating capital specific azure business maybe talk little bit capacity planning process evolved time approach cycle time might different today versus year ago yes let look top level mean think interesting thing business perspective tam huge mean tectonic shift 26 year microsoft lived do window lived oï¬ƒce created might biggest one seen even kind background tam actually huge question taking share growing fantastic expect capital spend capex continue rise meeting demand need go thing remember build azure also behalf microsoft property expand data center server put networking connectivity also serving oï¬ƒce 365 even serving xbox mean watch kid come home east coast go west coast see xbox kind pick go homework drop sudden california supporting kind platform capital spend u built top azure core course customer microsoft property running top expect go question around eï¬ƒciencies dealing absolutely every semester semester planning book new win cog improvement includes thing like tidying supply chain capacity planning getting better better figuring window positioning kind 101 kind stuff would say grown massively also trying grow internal system get eï¬ƒciencies time continued go lot different angle pick apart rule thumb think 1 spend today versus 1 five year ago five year productivity would expect get yes absolutely kind real core getting eï¬ƒcient answer absolutely right absolutely getting eï¬ƒcient go couple different thing one like said shortening lead time able better job predicting capacity come something concentrate heavily pretty massive deal mean say cloud transitioned case people would come run risk management 100,000 core kind run getting largest enterprise replacing entire q brad alan zelnick jason zanderdata center wind huge shift lot intentional planning getting eï¬ƒciencies within ï¬‚eet look combination utilization power utilization et cetera machine learning algorithm run internally optimize stuff making maximum usage plus lot around sku mix thing like well get best possible planning even course worldwide scale thing actually part eï¬ƒciencies get better better better time pivot different topic know everybody mind headline time security security clearly important design criterion cloud service becoming topical part microsoft message matter much spend security estimate 80 billion 90 billion 100 billion year continue wake breach microsoft seeing specific microsoft cloud responsibility much opportunity right versus something need inherent platform yes super important one obviously security never important especially even connectivity device around web wind taking even control everyday function interact think estimate seen 2020 world economy could get hit 1 trillion worth impact cybersecurity wow okay need make sure good job microsoft perspective spend like 1 billion r professional engineer men woman working task 3,500 employee security digital crime unit rest kind stuff 3,500 employee one interesting thing think security microsoft perspective see lot unique signal around globe see example everyone using oï¬ƒce 365 produce security technology protect customer product invest 1.2 billion socket window see well probably seen microsoft publicly work law enforcement agency around world take illegal botnets phishing site sort bad actor part security investment cloud perspective think old signal get 6.5 billion signal day pull signal see product public net well thing client botnets rest stuff include data analytics run machine learning algorithm figure bad pattern protect property oï¬ƒce xbox turn around make market question take tech protect customer make product available customer also advanced protection well example thing invest pointed mean bar going continue go q brad alan zelnick jason zander q brad alan zelnick term monetizing investment expect increasingly see going security dollar earmarked within customer budget versus monetizing adoption customer feeling confident oï¬ƒce 365 azure various cloud service offer implicit versus explicit sorry sure absolutely yes think think time continue evolve way security table stake right security cloud going built see kind kind value proposition cloud brings mean longer worrying hardware longer worrying underlying management come course certain element security come table stake part provide well default protection got people take advantage would something point would recognized people leveraging offering database paas core part built said today protecting cio looking portfolio running data center chance actually leveraging 12 separate product lot vendor stitching bunch stuff together trying figure go make stuff work paying product certain amount value waterfall part cloud provides lot advanced threat analytics available expect people want able strategy twofold one see u introduce product mentioned azure security center also oï¬ƒce threat analyzer well o365 bunch technology expect customer want value help protect case simplify portfolio mentioned also strong isv ecosystem 12 product cio using data center turn hybrid state expect see hybrid across board want make sure meeting also working isvs bring product along well think see u core table stake differentiated offering think simplify world really good job managing also going healthy ecosystem help everybody bridge gap isvs also modernize product excellent thank much opener jason talked hybrid distinct attribute differentiator offering also think intelligent cloud often talked context well intelligent edge many talk edge computing next generation growth opportunity technology broadly think edge going various player going horizontal winner going specific specialized edge player like security edge player et cetera heard satya way rest organization jason zanderexamples like precision agriculture precision medicine talk bit edge opportunity see today important microsoft well positioned capture yes great one see world view microsoft used framing last couple year actually think captured quite well took world view intelligent cloud intelligent edge think one thing need cloud back end really kind substrate mean know matter device using phone tablet car mean cloud help give u global reach maximum processing power edge point different sort form factor available could anything device carrying stuff table bag thing like sensor running building mean thing part edge intelligent piece come believe smart mean ca bunch signal coming dumb device sensor measure thing also want smart edge favorite example think driving car like point want enough smart board car see red bouncing ball come front hit brake right away like would driver high probability kid coming right behind like want making cloud figure hit brake okay mean like mean like right right think intelligence piece something super important topical taxonomy let mention kind hybrid aspect think play maybe come back edge okay hybrid perspective mean mean going think edge taxonomy going hybrid kind solution part solution since day 1 think hybrid super important identity data security also form factor run couple software application got thing put together core part done hybrid offering actually really really strong come 20 year experience actually done software data center structurally positioned quite well matter mix look like customer particular tell one really great example seeing single azure hybrid benefit mean take sa license window server sql server run premise also bring azure cloud azure cloud look pricing perspective mean running workload sa amazon could 5x expensive workload right seeing really good dynamic market lot people server workload might running sql server 2008 product line coming end service lot conversation customer right well modernize like upgrade place existing equipment also data center migration come along give azure hybrid benefit help actually pull tech forward actually run ï¬‚exibly much much cheaper seeing whole bunch company q brad alan zelnick jason zanderare starting zero gosh maybe great time move workload get modernized latest version kind get evergreen solution plus cloud saving great combination example azure stack side let stop hybrid want get back edge question please okay edge basis wanted go hit see line background okay got combination cloud got hybrid component run data center get thing like azure stack generation appliance actually done joined azure 2012 already part strategy back since day 1 start getting edge thing let take great example like connected factory one favorite think factory running stopping production line factory could cost 1 million minute hour depending could really really expensive able like let get iot scenario come back onto edge combination controller thing ï¬‚oor hooked put azure stack shop ï¬‚oor make sure everything nice connected even fiber connection massive storm hurricane know something like factory keep running intelligent edge part also lot ai machine learning locally actually got people production manufacturing jabil good example put camera production line actually take picture component go different manufacturing stage use ml model actually look look like image recognition actually ï¬‚ag defect early fix line go great example intelligent edge right get azure stack component thing come together course machine thing running factory upload log public cloud hyperscale cloud cheap storage lot compute start running big analytics job tune production run like worse manufacturing germany middle december cold five day row depends upon factory material make decision tune put stuff together believe really awesome solution dovetail quite well part strategy since day 1 mentioned industrial one absolutely lead industrial iot azure iot got 70 major partner look thing like schneider johnson ge siemens rest folk part house also company mentioned jabil cummins even coffee maker stuff like factory kind like world view applied smart city smart building smart everything kind light sound like possibility become endless really cool love q brad alan zelnick jason zander come together appreciate consistency azure stack seamless experience relates azure cloud customer benefit get azure hybrid benefit come together enables customer adopt architecture best based requirement constraint know every investor room whoever listening made bet rate pace cloud migration look like look back 3 five year 10 year road much enterprise estate `` premise versus `` cloud however define curious data look experience world view mean saw ibm make massive acquisition red hat one justification hey 20 enterprise today life public cloud thought yes one mentioned hybrid taxonomy like actually view since day 1 persistent hybrid state never viewed snap finger number everybody hyperscale cloud fact factory example gave smart city critical infrastructure example always going hybrid mode always anticipated expected would strategy since day 1 made investment perspective going help customer meet whatever demand look like think place seeing people really looking hyperscale cloud great way go run workload seeing cost saving hybrid benefit mentioned keeping able actually save money thing absolutely driving growth hyperscale piece side like mentioned way sometimes sovereignty disconnected scenario thing absolutely going want run thing way good news think evaluating product portfolio operating structurally set well stuff 20 year lot world workload run software fact asset parlayed part strategy cloud symmetry really set u thing mentioned activity way seeing lot folk frankly lot hybrid washing originally slide really meant put workload data center happy title say hybrid really hybrid starting see validation actually back strategy move made think seeing lot market people trying get back started hybrid case vendor never actually made hyperscale public cloud case hyperscale cloud company going partnership try figure `` well okay great backtrack get stuff onboard see coming way view validation strategy since day 1 respect ibm red hat last comment made would tell got really good relationship red hat going really well got great adoption rhel enterprise linux actually created q brad alan zelnick jason zander q brad alan zelnick jason zanderdifferentiated support solution red hat red hat engineer microsoft site customer call issue going talk u get phone tagged unique thing red hat ton mutual customer going keep supporting customer frankly perspective news really change going keep momentum going keep supporting customer topic microsoft embraced open architecture last several year way 5 six year ago think nobody could imagined critical strategy yes hopefully people seeing kind cultural transformation microsoft kind attitude work partner way think benefit couple decade company kind maturation wisdom kind gained hope hope people see would say part also want make sure open source perspective going meet customer live absolutely using open source important want make sure got solution higher run rate linux creates virtual machine public cloud massive mean going support thing like operating system also middleware developer stack devop tool part stack need also surprise people sometimes also huge contributor open source fact 16,000 microsoft engineer contribute github actually highest corporation see actually really embraced supporting entire thing think really customer choice enabling really end day platform go towards cloud want make sure workload run top topic thanks jason relationship embracing red hat open source linux specific ibm deal thought term impact may may way think red hat going forward ibm company yes say huge overlap believe customer really drove u deeper relationship red hat look historically maybe deep relationship last year actually really great really good program given mutual customer absolutely going continue support customer believe red hat going want able q brad alan zelnick jason zander q brad alan zelnicksame thing reason able make sure happens far concerned mean full steam ahead part partnership thing change time reevaluate right want customer know mutual customer know absolutely full steam going support excellent pivot slightly different question kpis metric use run business see externally key measure success azure business inside microsoft yes got ton would say number one thing want look customer happy platform experiencing one first thing would measure business perspective consumed revenue think cloud service interested people actually using meter spinning solving problem absolutely look consumed revenue stat publish saw 76 growth q1 azure revenue growth come example recognized people using kind commit number one also measure one internally look internal side also look combination making customer happy platform got existing customer usage starting increase would mean sign healthy customer relationship moving workload finding value platform want make sure go also going track business perspective mix service people use get cloud journey able take advantage service database service platform service usage increasing also good sign healthy thing internally owning product well one super interesting measure satisfaction customer obsessed want make sure happy look net promoter score make sure customer like would recommend friend yes thing kind client side thing commercial want make sure thing going quite well well course metric would look net customer addition got healthy customer growing mix healthy actually adding new customer well sort thing track internally wo even get perf stress whole bunch engineering stuff like 2 inch deck month entire division lot fun call fundamental always say put fun fun day engineer love great anyway business perspective audience topical one one think relevant excellent think measuring customer success satisfaction think context element offering actually jason zandergone ahead adopted got premium service data service talked little bit iot lower level got infrastructure maybe talk little bit adoption pattern economics customer go way graduate nirvana layer 7 however think world economics customer stickiness relationship think various adoption curve layer 7 networking dev background showing okay see software engineer recognize one mean obviously going meet customer exactly infrastructure want come want get hardware compute networking storage absolutely support like thing got database service paas azure iot medium also ai ml prebuilt service facial recognition speech text kind stuff thing actually take away lot tacs otherwise use business get thing going think benefit one get like take data solution great thing like automatic backup recovery like make sure thing work keep patched thing cost today probably spending lot personnel time actually making sure go service get benefit get le kind toil come actually get good value find customer move service actually save money perspective good business evaluating business course service structurally higher margin also stickier mean hope win customer get better solution actually save money way operate overall estate actually take saving apply new thing business perspective since looking microsoft structurally higher margin kind stickier environment happier customer nsat et cetera thing kind come together couple great example one instance awesome example take sql server including 2019 latest version bunch big data tech built run premise instance allows take apps move public cloud land thing take care toil backup patching kind stuff happens great example also service support fantastic impetus people make move also thing like cosmos db worldwide nosql database first kind today actually lot work engineer go set say want run something 3 continent got lot work make sure data get replicated around world fast keep customer running cosmos db go portal create cosmos db start writing data unique differentiated kind solution great example analytics side sql dw g2 cheaper faster redshift great solution well wrapped ai stack kind think structure come lot really really nice product offering q brad alan zelnick jason zander q brad alan zelnick jason zander q brad alan zelnick related question think measured win rate insight data customer success microsoft historical customer running ton sql server data center versus oracle whatever alternative might versus versus cloud prospect commentary term success mix would seem naturally account easier kind welcome door commentary along line thank good thing point support platform vendor mentioned even something compete category like relational database customer clear use lick microsoft software except azure 100 linux 100 java using mysql postgresql using oracle 100 stack thing using cloud like mentioned run rate linux virtual machine actually higher window server machine coming absolutely support healthy mix excited always would want people think u microsoft stack cloud actually support everything think healthy run rate mix proved top point fact actually create software lot company high percentage company running microsoft server running sql server well make u natural home awesome support open source support also natural home microsoft workload think great balance vertical perspective well imagine obvious synergy area opportunity retail example one right absolutely retail really good one actually mentioned think lot customer want go spend money get technology provider turn around us money compete actually seeing lot company vertical start seeing covered competition become competition people otherwise serving see inquiry come vertical absolutely finished black friday cyber monday really really major company work asos u.k. walmart jet.com whole set big retailer fantastic kind holiday shopping season went another great example lot fin sector manufacturing energy take pick jason zander q brad alan zelnick jason zanderawesome term supply chain think infrastructure sourcing talk little bit decision get made design specific chipset whatever component might philosophy behind choosing versus b yes great question kind 2 angle think first one supply chain 101 capacity management 101 mean anybody done mba done kind work mean make sure absolutely great massive massive scale really really fast keep building system big scale business something get shelf component go run also building system nice advantage hyperscale cloud build software capacity supply chain work actually work well control fabric run ï¬‚eet mean get signal immediately kind come together integrated way vendor perspective normal kind hygiene pick multiple vendor make sure good job sourcing perspective also open source project project called sonic basically networking thing contributed back ran top switch pay high premium switching inside data center sonic open sourced made available run equipment example software side reduce cost going pay high margin frankly never data center cost prohibitive running scale hardware perspective also partner lot hardware manufacturer buy enough scale buy 1 million something get discount also probably inï¬‚uence design actually also custom hardware well thing like deployed fpgas across ï¬‚eet networking actually whole silicon design team virtually design hardware design silicon happens group also thing like hololens surface actually rest team also work data center figure okay silicon improvement put data center well talk little bit advantage using fpgas going deep design yes fpga really really cool mean field programmable gate array really mean hard burned silicon fastest kind performance software top probably little bit slower fpgas right kind come top key thing give ï¬‚exibility actually go additional tweak get speed fast burnt silicon next notch leverage networking get connectivity virtual machine continue improve q brad alan zelnick jason zander q brad alan zelnick jason zandercan also leverage thing like ai example brainwave project leverage fpgas really awesome job thing like image recognition fantastic go make go course silicon design perspective algorithm run fpgas get hardened turn around silicon team turn custom silicon custom asics actually load ï¬‚eet actually make real estate available chip next set algorithm next set win awesome way recently read effort looking building subsea data center intuitive would assume lot le expensive build data center top solid ground terra firma advantage see science project going wake one day everybody going data center spongebob underneath sea pool backyard boat drink yes think particular project project natick code name research project clear microsoft research folk pulling back together really done taken actual data center put water like literally like coast scotland recent one guy dropped couple different thing one 50 world population actually life near water mean actually near coastal line sort mean access city put data compute capacity close also course natural insulation potentially perpetual energy wave everything like also give u experience perspective example clear actually go greenlight johnny quest scuba gear go fix hard drive kind opportunity figure run hardware minimal amount touch fact one touch done decommissioned think think essentially production terra firma energy stable ground everything else massive site build even experience gain help u better job operationalizing ï¬‚eet really great thing start innovation starting find even dovetail stuff around quantum computing thing well knowledge gain actually quite interesting jason disappointment time got zillion question ask thank immensely tremendously insightful really appreciate time c technology conference q brad alan zelnick jason zanderthank much appreciate welcome thank everybody
