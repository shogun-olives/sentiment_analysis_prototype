good afternoon everybody thank attending deutsche bank virtual technology conference name taylor mcginnis one software analyst deutsche bank ending great lineup keynote high note tom keane microsoft corporate vice president azure tom thanks joining great well thank perfect begin q would like remind everybody submit question via chat box left side screen let get started tom believe held several different role microsoft year part azure team quite time start might helpful audience give quick introduction current role microsoft yeah absolutely taylor thanks sit engineering team cloud computing division microsoft responsible cloud computing infrastructure around world place driving expansion cloud data center underlying engineering make cloud work sophisticated customer across industry solution building industry range commercial industry government prior working azure team involved standing oﬃce 365 cloud service prior worked number server product taylor mcginnis tom keane taylor mcginnisover last 20 year busy microsoft whole bunch fun exciting thing perfect great introduction well many others listening following team closely several year believe first time azure business faced downturn challenging environment high level start based recent conversation customer share key trend within azure conversation evolved relative past quarter noticing significant shift type workload deal momentum would interesting ﬂag group yeah look great place start obviously 2020 pretty incredible year term different environmental factor satya described seen well saw two year digital transformation occur first two month become clear moved 2020 business digital foundation digital technology place resilient able handle challenge brought look digital transformation occurring clear seen acceleration customer remote work initially provided mechanism allowed people course continue operating growing people expect capability available wherever working observed microsoft cloud computing adoption covid broken concern may existed inside organization around particular workload ready cloud particular scenario could performed remotely seen many customer begin example stand course team collaboration technology window virtual desktop solution allows customer run window 10 cloud digitally enabling set application connection stand business really seen accelerated adoption large set customer also breaking historical concern accelerating plan already place make use cloud okay hearing vertical like communication seeing greater demand may drive cloud usage others travel hospitality may looking downsize first net durable existing consumption growth environment given pricing model never really tested scale downturn hard easy hard scale workload tom keane taylor mcginnis tom keane yeah seen interesting behavior customer give couple different example make real first obviously covid resulted lot customer needing make service available customer digital mechanism building new application existing application course resulted additional usage azure also seen initially little bit surprising fact became quite obvious acceleration customer plan move workload cloud way saving money example many customer working created plan move large workload cloud plan short horizon workload like sap computing place organization may invested heavy capex infrastructure actually observed covid even industry may structural downturn cloud plan actually accelerated moving aggressively cloud way reduce spend use ﬂexibility cloud provides scale workload whilst may downturn immediate term certain industry industry fact accelerating capturing across various different workload trend call certainly sure talk move tier 1 workload cloud covid shown cloud resilient become effectively critical infrastructure underline many positive society right given lot customer confidence move sophisticated workload important workload cloud tier 1 workload highly available resilient power business customer feeling comfortable standing seeing different industry like financial service sovereign wealth fund others using cloud different way result confidence built 2020 yeah love talk seeing tier 1 workload talk little bit later topic secondly experiencing impact customer looking optimize consumption resource effort save money time wondering elaborate impact azure growth taylor mcginnis tom keaneyeah course advantage cloud allow customer continuously optimize want help customer save money use resource eﬃciently ensure infrastructure set right way continue daily helping customer use cloud eﬃcient way absolutely customer able use cloud save spend configure workload way financially line expectation also seen mentioned earlier digital business providing significantly agility robustness actually driving increased usage cloud customer moving workload expectation continue grow workload moving often highly available higher resiliency expectation mentioned tier 1 workload course making use different aspect cloud bottom line yes course continually helping customer optimize usage resource also staying adoption leading indicator success focus adoption partnership customer allowing move important workload understood last quarter microsoft talked continued strength customer signing large azure contract initial field work suggested covid environment may led slowing deal activity migration seem materialized significant way interesting even commentary talked acceleration term tier 1 migration love get thought way guess could check wrong would characterize customer priority today environment impact azure business yeah obviously place work lot customer talk customer every day think worth explaining value system always looked customer relationship partnership partnership 100 focused joint success getting customer adopted using technology go power business optimize internal cost structure one thing ensure providing highest level understanding different customer different industry highest level value driving investment offer customer different industry prepackaged solution product capability meet specific need course continue satya amy hood cfo clear help customer migration ﬂexible contractual model consumption trend seen proof point deal taylor mcginnis tom keane taylor mcginnisand consumption model give lot ﬂexibility focused building partnership customer helping adopt move cloud make sense love dive topic partnering customer helping facilitate migration since significant implementation cost associated migration microsoft offering guy offering resource financial ﬂexibility term contract payment term help facilitate movement premise cloud environment maybe similar note know microsoft talked possibility customer prefer contract large multiyear azure commitment given current uncertainty seen material shift partner customer enabling build cloud foundation one element digital foundation often cloud control plane building foundation allows implement security privacy compliance policy way organization make use cloud different business requirement compliance requirement even cost requirement factored digital foundation give organization confidence make use cloud inside boundary boundary financial absolutely seeing adoption around mentioned earlier tier 1 workload tier 1 workload broadening different industry example recently announced lot work around 5g connectivity done number acquisition support technology allow core communication infrastructure running top azure open course total addressable market whole range different option customer consume part partnership ﬂexible different way customer want work u focus adoption leading indicator success got love dive guide financials intelligent cloud guide microsoft quarter implies le moderation azure growth rate saw quarter much driven consumption trend normalizing customer adjust covid landscape migration returning level still yet tom keane taylor mcginnis tom keane look adoption every single day look interaction customer seeing large workload moving cloud cloud migration example talked lot work ubs swiss investment bank moving key workload cloud well building workload complex area like risk management done lot work talked publicly chevron allowed chevron work energy eﬃciency green energy make use cloud digital foundation well new application building allow open new area business done work government veteran administration example able build bridge serve veteran united state making use digital technology elastically scaling application matching patient doctor eﬃciently result reducing risk challenge covid provides three example example organization continuing migrate scale put place digital foundation control plane also building application business service provide citizen continue evolve really continuing see demand across dimension topic thought share shape full recovery might look like azure throughout year next think u helping customer industry adopt cloud start mentioned control plane foundation work customer across different industry ensuring cloud digital foundation existing business well foundation future business one hyper focused area u work around data understanding different schema data industry using example providing different solution customer retail consumer good healthcare allow data product natively understand different industry give customer confidence move data cloud knowing cloud understands respective industry allows go build cloud application easily make use new technology like predictive analytics insight visualization taylor mcginnis tom keaneso look customer little different industry little different clear many industry growing incredibly rapid pace pace accelerated 2020 obviously retail use cloud computing people move online shopping significant spoken publicly work walmart allow elastically scale grow based business need similarly europe talked partnership h area like financial service interaction point become different using cloud allow use computing effectively decouple constraint place may historically compute constrained even moving new segment area like space making use overhead imagery help farmer eﬃcient united state help department agriculture understand environmental pattern say seeing lot growth lot different industry thing remain constant consistent u interesting thanks sharing want switch gear love get thought internal data center eﬃciencies microsoft realizing turn course helping drive really strong gross margin improvement azure last quarter microsoft mentioned extending server networking equipment useful life four year sorry four year three two year respectively provide color driving opportunity still eﬃciency gain yeah obviously covid gone two year digital transformation two month provided u positive problem tremendous amount demand incredibly focused customer ensuring resource need order successful look cloud computing infrastructure continuing optimize covid show strong demand short period time course microsoft inside azure business provide resource customer also resource built top azure inside microsoft example microsoft team communication collaboration experience built top azure enormous growth saw team result able expand azure platform drive eﬃciencies real time physical element cloud move overnight software literally saw initial month covid azure making significant taylor mcginnis tom keaneimprovements allow team scale meet first wave demand came covid look inside data center constantly innovating driving improvement based supporting customer ongoing demand moving faster support demand also economic well physical advantage u example talked lot use green energy energy cell way driving innovation consume power well removing dependency yesterday announced publicly brought seaﬂoor scotland 110 foot underwater underwater data center whilst may seem like crazy idea actually seen phenomenal viability concept driving research nothing short incredible see continue drive eﬃciencies data center world continue grow footprint support customer key thing happening across software happening across hardware well across physical environment data center reside right interesting example addition mentioned guy public term technology helping drive eﬃciencies outcome window actually implemented yeah mean one theme think really important touch especially covid cyber sovereignty microsoft long time firmly believed fact inception believe need enterprise one clear need enterprise commercial enterprise well government cyber sovereignty covid many country around world many multinationals think lot sovereignty good come supply chain data stored line strong belief importance cyber sovereignty building data center around world today azure resides 21 different country last six month seen u make announcement expand cloud even country seen announcement made publicly around building example place like mexico expanding europe location italy expansion asia pacific region even growth africa emerging market taylor mcginnis tom keaneand certainly cyber sovereignty allowed u grow existing footprint eﬃciencies described also grow cloud around world customer deeply value data residency cyber sovereignty give u way ﬂexible closer customer want capability capacity meet local rule regulation super important go serve restricted market like government financial service health life science increasingly even supply chain manufacturing another place innovation made economics back end allow u eﬃciently effectively go scale globally meet cyber sovereignty requirement yeah want press little bit probably overlap term question ask mentioned let dig little bit data center expansion first couple month post covid spike usage across certain workload certain geography reportedly led data center outage look last quarter capex spend increased significantly q1 guided similar level spend thinking ensuring suﬃcient capacity guess meet growing cloud need sure talking technology enhancement guy making sure data closer customer weigh decision around expansion new data center region versus increasing footprint existing region yeah look multiple part talk mean first incredibly focused ensuring customer use cloud grow scale covid course unpredictable event saw microsoft team example cloud able scale literally overnight grow level nothing else ever represented seen customer around world fact global cloud infrastructure allowed u scale incredible way also done ensure customer grow focus first customer critical industry justice public safety police force example human life critical workload prioritized focused lesson learned term providing additional capacity able respond ensure customer continue grow place continue optimize supply chain software well hardware respond customer demand wherever demand quickly possibly look global infrastructure hero cloud region
