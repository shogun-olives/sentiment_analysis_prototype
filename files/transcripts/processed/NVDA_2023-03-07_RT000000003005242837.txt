really think make electronic health record operation happening health hospital truly transformational guess one thing wanted ask come ai work nvidia automotive industry towards autonomous driving right technology move one speed regulator move different speed let say kind started conversation probably know le healthcare people room seen way regulation push back innovation auto space even simple thing taking away visual rearview mirror replacing one seem like big deal got massive regulatory push back auto industry took long time happen lot thing three talking pace computing innovation going accelerate massively view lot different vertical healthcare particular regulate mean big broad conversation kimberly team like interact regulator like thought simulated protein versus traditional method matter across whole bunch area right imaging like ai machine going diagnose brain cancer rather radiologist actually pas fda pas liability lawsuit know maybe opening big worm think super interesting topic get asked automotive space lot quite certain applies healthcare anybody want take crack one kimberly powell molly gibson yes take huge worm without doubt think behooves upon u relationship regulatory body need educate different field make difference need help educate fda also educated fda gone built process platform adhere hardware software platform lot thing like documentation sound simple absolutely imperative traceability back software way lot run single algorithm lot software running finally documenting passing way audited something taking onus upon feel like otherwise could critical path ca layered cake described say good luck ge good luck brand new startup amazing idea mean making pace innovation couple thing one learn product perspective apply think thing also think world learning automotive industry learned method might able used help one method discovered car simulation nvidia creates game simulate natural world apply technology driving car simulated digital twin physically accurate world predict create training data synthetic data generation find corner case unfortunate child might run front car able generate enough scenario lot confidence ai going catch synthetic data generation replay hardware loop world car actually saw would react system plate way get auditable trail enhance data corner case world see often build robust development system come back notion method method going evolve make ai algorithm circle lung nodule guess people covid might lung cancer completely skate problem degree retrain algorithm patient loop figure process tool order facilitate one think active learn direction two think technology actually applied make easier yes think expand kind emphasize education component u thinking developing actually taking brad gray q matthew ramsaymolecules clinic people lot realizing fda behind technology actually worried anything particular molecule lot way lot reason going safer people fear unknown lot education like decide way u educating fda regulatory body well learning area need confidence beginning working type question since day founded imagine creating new molecule new protein never seen nature immune system never seen protein could imagine scenario large immune reaction molecule understand process actually reduce immunogenicity place well molecule nature discovered actually able show learn immune system responds protein able reduce safer level traditional discovery method able long show every possible preclinical model demonstrate share continue educate regulatory body actually believe safer almost every way molecule discovered nutritional random mechanism good imagine world future today using safety regulatory process preclinical model animal model traditionally seeing drug go people imagine world change completely could actually get rid animal start thing like either simulation could thing actually human organoid model need animal anymore combination data ai new experimental method start easily represent human body like mouse human use time simulate human look like better able conversation back forth believing believe method u also learn potential pitfall potential concern address rapidly iterative process better say life science tool industry lucky enough regulated scientist scientific customer incredibly embrace innovation change faster market think possibility one fastest area application within healthcare new computed ai approach brad gray q matthew ramsay kimberly powellyes brad actually talking spatial essentially used go commanding diagnostics given maybe use ai discover pattern whatnot issue long go regulatory process validating marker recently program yes think next several year spatial biology largely focused discovery discovering pattern tissue might predict responds drug ai help u make discovery ai may may required steal diagnostics think know yet think without doubt helpful tool discovery endeavor course regulatory issue whatsoever okay maybe question kimberly healthcare unique perspective actually see customer know sensitivity potentially saying interest discovery aspect translational taking discovery trying move clinic clinical trial yes say early discovery discovery active part late couple area picking early discovery molly platform really apply generative ai method target discovery identification lead optimization interaction understanding going interact body literally every stage drug discovery fully affected generative ai era model applied combination model potentially replace known today virtual screening early discovery think known future heavily silicon informed course wet lab might go lot early discovery know ratio 80 wet lab 20 compute 80 compute 20 wet lab tool describing later becoming super useful clinical trial mean pharma company sitting decade worth image use approach unlabeled data shoved algorithm trained pretty phenomenal thing thing lot cheaper hiring radiologist annotate clinical trial data frankly probably precise looking whether patient responding tumor response accuracy measurement responder lot potential think opportunity imaging space algorithm showed u able build multimodal algorithm patient outcome phenotypic q matthew ramsay brad grayimage data going produce lot translational application well clinical trial opportunity eï¬ƒciencies improving know expensive part developing drug know good 10 success rate excuse get patient function garbage early discovery garbage also obviously huge function choosing monitoring patient trial go say commercialization side course natural language processing huge tool able constantly able analyze going data able discover good bad medicine able feed back whole loop today think lot focus early two really coming earnest especially chatgpt moment happened ubiquitousness able apply ai image partially feel like made great contribution open source tool made imaging space field really said got lot image data think couple minute left super interesting much appreciate guy part sort ask devil advocate question end make fun one thing spent team sammy spent lot time autonomous car arena different level automated driving different thing gone science technology application industry automotive space conversation nvidia founder jensen 10 year ago think timeline going sitting around steering wheel car would little bit admitted reality moving transforming huge incumbent industry take time right gut tell going healthcare world huge huge potential think jensen described ai healthcare next business nvidia three like hindering pace adoption innovation much data know enough data scientist cost hardware regulation know thinking could get rid two three factor thing could move heck lot faster two company making thing move quickly outlier rather maybe everyone pace let use analogy comparing auto industry took longer think impediment ai innovation healthcare molly gibsoni mean think one thing customer scientist every scientist individual scale data generation pretty small machine learning algorithm need massive training set honestly generated one individual scientist think required truly unlock machine learning potential scientific data set paradigm sharing pooling data honestly new community scientist viewed data precious proprietary want go back look hard generate single repository data inaudible think one rate limiting step scientific field certain area working hard creating single repository data lake spatial biology data ever generated platform go help create situation data one place allow u get scale think scientific world finding data set still clean algorithm part rate limiting yes agree think come cultural component scientific community something surprisingly persist company even within scientist individually company think probably quite surprising people familiar field kind ownership data scientific arena one thing generate spend lot time building beginning data collective asset mantra ca even really see data go central repository generate something sound like big step many company many biotech company would see happening many company data individual computer might excel spreadsheet someone leaf company know data go lot cultural component think extends beyond biotech pharma eventually real kind commercializer developer drug like spent lot time talk pharma company view type technology developing generate would use one challenge generating novel protein protein engineering field decade people trained engineer protein drug discovery one cultural change getting people board fact new way thing trained last 20 year way something multiple cultural element think bigger barrier thing still challenge like generating lot data getting right regulatory agency educated think thing move faster getting full community kind change way kimberly powelldata collective asset integration computation experimentation view new way thing field around decade yes guess kind clean extent healthcare delivery side thing mean think recognize bit systemic problem healthcare system whereas talking friend soccer field last year helped achieved guinness world record fastest time sequencing diagnosis stanford oxford nanopore genomics platform helped child know going death doorstep soon heart failure put transplant alive well today seizing child able sequenced within hour like knowing need sort vitamin supplement dear friend soccer field talking mom going diagnostic odyssey actually mutation 80 treatable known last six month part making technology readily accessible genome going 100 ca make standard care continuously partner clinician dream changing standard care showing actually plausible able kind create inside healthcare system truly challenge think idea one think unique vantage point nvidia work across many different industry see car spatial genomics platform dissimilar need become brad telling informatics going innovation engine distant future medical sensing device company built platform innovate way realize huge economy problem reimbursement reimbursement would drive sort disrupt innovation innovator dilemma kind thing healthcare solvable make world record known advertise really see possibility hope start formidable change healthcare delivery agree molly u tech company went j.p. morgan several year ago conversation wo say large pharma cio saying never going ai house going farm jensen course respectfully disagreed said would ever say biggest technology breakthrough time silly would become use technology apply everywhere course drug discovery mean pharmaceutical one challenging industry planet earth get educated use ai invest q matthew ramsay kimberly powell brad gray molly gibsonin degree partner another degree internally would even pick good partner little bit humorousness think starting change pretty rapidly notion change management culture biology second way know little hard people hear maybe little perhaps believe hope contribute think end last year generative ai biology absolutely milestone milestone excited see year brings well thank everybody hopefully guy found conversation unique interesting thank three panelist steve partnership pulling together thank much thank thank thank
