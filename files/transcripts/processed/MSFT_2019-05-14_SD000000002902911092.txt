okay good afternoon everyone thank much joining u conference mark murphy software analyst jpmorgan great pleasure u today kirk koenigsbauer microsoft kirk thank much u thank excited question answer going talking one exciting product microsoft called microsoft 365 kirk start background sure name kirk koenigsbauer microsoft since gosh 1991 spent little bit time amazon.com four year middle run microsoft 365 business inclusive oﬃce 365 enterprise mobility suite security suite well window 10 enterprise bunch stuff think people familiar oﬃce familiar window probably little le familiar whole suite product kirk koenigsbauer q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbaueroverseeing give u little bit overview microsoft 365 fit overall microsoft portfolio sure microsoft 365 product launched two year ago mentioned product includes many product may heard essentially cloud productivity version think microsoft 365 sort world productivity cloud includes value would find oﬃce 365 example oﬃce apps sharepoint new product launched called microsoft team exchange online forth includes enterprise mobility security suite number different workload within around management security compliance course window 10 core part offering well sell part essentially call modern workplace sort really centered around productivity collaboration help u frame growth opportunity may looking microsoft 365 think noted oﬃce 365 commercial revenue line large one growing 30 recently pretty incredible given scale window going well em going well want think broader opportunity microsoft 365 yes good question essentially way would start frame repivoting whole approach term selling productivity collaboration value customer microsoft 365 workload way organize sale force go market way organize partner incentive channel incentive way increasingly organizing r engineering make investment sort siloed way individual product regard literally thinking whole system across microsoft 365 deliver integrated value term think growth product mentioned 30 growth oﬃce 365 component think 800 million active user window 10 crossed 100 million seat sold em sort substats underneath really quite impressive 180 million people monthly active commercial space oﬃce 365 ton momentum working business many year really great see think growth prospect many way lot like think growth used talk growth oﬃce 365 essentially play p x q business look installed base socket constantly want look grow socket pool look increasingly drive arpu socket socket side growth perspective certainly well positioned enterprise corporate space still see room expand seat q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauerbusinesses primarily think entering market like regulated industry historically challenge selling sort cloud unit economics microsoft 365 forth able reach pocket user able sell past smb important socket growth market u see lot white space wide open space u drive socket cloud socket overall last area socket side would say big growth area u think worker category worker historically underserved technology might manufacturing might retail sale professional might hospitality might certain segment health care even financial service tethered desktop machine dedicated laptop maybe shared device opportunity reach customer well arpu side talked opportunity move customer stack term value whether moving cloud sort first step arpu driver u given ltv derive customer selling increasing tier service within oﬃce 365 within window getting microsoft 365 see quite bit growth dimension new offering talked lot kirk building modern experience talked lot security past talked lot compliance past think apparent u lot going componentry stack see microsoft core differentiation today yes putting aside workload referenced certainly jump back think thing customer talk u term differentiation one integration value sense sure customer want go one single vendor opportunity workload common platform management perspective interoperability perspective broader tco perspective stuff work better together increasingly important differentiator u way microsoft 365 level think security fragmented business see csos sec ops really valuing notion integration key one another value prop resonating u particularly enterprise side position taken around data privacy trust increasingly sort thing happening world today message resonating really quite well benefited investment work around gdpr regulation see sort happening world customer trust whether public sector customer course large organization trust hyperscale cloud infrastructure work big deal q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbaueranother big differentiator seeing increasingly around data ai pick security one example think signal world security signal whether coming system whether coming identity system whether coming variety different end point able look signal reason ai capability investment security professional microsoft differentiator number reason let alone work product like team referenced experience side work security work compliance thing hear customer want come back team moment wanted mention team attended build conference last week incredible amazing event satya spent quite bit time talking microsoft graph think something really captured attention explain u microsoft graph going leveraged across microsoft 365 great yes maybe start basically microsoft graph think api database sits cloud service secure meeting data available customer secure data get want essentially think collection activity people inside organization whether collection email meeting task people go meeting essentially graph activity top sort raw information also derive insight top example spending much time used spend information derive one organization within company better job collaboration another insight derive graph pretty powerful capability available customer sense use graph experience good simple example would microsoft search microsoft search great example app us built us graph back end search people content apps infrastructure whatever might need really provided via graph also really interesting ecosystem building around graph whether isvs build solution want sell business solution made better accessing graph information one example think satya used build surveymonkey company want bunch survey better target population people integrating tech microsoft graph precise matter even building simple line business application integrating experience like microsoft 365 use graph data make experience better people way think graph q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauer q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauer something leverageable corporate customer well app provider developer correct want really crystal clear company data say customer data customer say yes isv app plug access graph use data model something available isvs something use okay want come back team mentioned moment ago appears making great progress something heard gotten done check interview ecosystem partner resellers si firm telling u team go see month later seat count doubling tripling quadrupling satya said something app ever recall seeing said last week build see team first differentiating secondly see team competing company like slack zoom sure starting differentiation piece maybe also talk little bit case everyone familiar team product launched guess hit anniversary product went general availability march product brings together number different workload help people organization communicate collaborate think hub teamwork essentially team really size participant many different team core part value proposition offering provides number different workﬂows integrated single experience example got collaboration capability perspective got chat use bot integrate content got meeting capability host meeting like ad hoc meeting thing like record meeting audio conference meeting lot meeting capability built product capability communicate well using chat forth phone system technology wanted call customer call wife call cellphone number pstn service integrated dial pad forth bunch work third party create hardware device whether meeting conference call whatever also integrated oﬃce application team say oﬃce apps mean word excel powerpoint course q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauer q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauerintegrated experience also thing like onedrive storage sharepoint literally take portal page internet page include integrate right within team super super easy sort thing power bi dashboard analytics wired team sort combination pretty powerful differentiator u customer tell u yes might legacy meeting solution might using slack solution idea able come offer single tool end user integrated different workload coherent across really quite differentiator u another differentiator really seen product couple year old last would say 6 12 month super enthusiastic customer responding scaffolding team provides integrate line business process workﬂows experience referenced example worker earlier one use case seeing company going back graph talked moment ago using graph data integrating line business application sometimes business application say built azure end inside team experience also thing like power apps well really great experience customer could notion horizontal workload ability able meeting simultaneously line business application business process integrated right experience super super sticky much cleaner environment everything integrated one space customer really resonating sound like core differentiation comprehensiveness integration point oﬃce woven graph woven presume cortana woven yes would say one piece mention important capability around whether fact operate data center worldwide fact added dlp type capability thing like ethical wall sort security compliance around team infrastructure one company love got great sort new experience end user love also something controlled managed way work business going one hook pulling enterprise premium skus like e5 sku maybe could talk u customer conversation shaping around e5 even e3 q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauer q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauersure well first part question see team something help u drive sort arpu growth time sense mentioned earlier conversation people start organization start using team see usage rate increase dramatically across board team team pull microsoft 365 value good thing couple different dimension one course people using product satisfied people typically retention rate renewal rate higher forth really great thing help u approach look sell higher tier service would transition guess conversation around e5 e5 folk know much essentially well chased fact sell microsoft 365 oﬃce 365 em component even window different tier service e1 e3 e5 microsoft 365 2 tier e5 set premium set value offer customer essentially 4 core workload workload around security workload around compliance set workload around communication set workload around analytics value proposition around interesting different customer different time depending life cycle would say right term driving growth e5 security compliance top conversation customer want security every customer go talk want hear team want hear security got lot pull u enterprise referenced e3 still lot room go moving customer whether cloud e3 tier oﬃce 365 e3 microsoft 365 e3 another arpu driver u essentially still see leg going back little bit first part question whether socket play arpu play feel like good growth opportunity would put team security kind 1 2 position maybe interchange critically important term driving gravitation upward toward e3 e5 sure absolutely yes okay interesting team would context already early point yes might may intuitive initially think something driving incredibly rapid usage inside account q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauer q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbaueritself lay foundation upon go drive higher tier value okay switching gear little bit interesting announcement past week 2 partnership vmware microsoft clearly something significant happening specific reference microsoft 365 oﬃce 365 want make sure kind thinking going mean specifically microsoft 365 portfolio product oversee bet first guess would say referenced build earlier one key message wanted lay build really since satya leadership think particular doubling notion interoperability notion openness want super well industry also want create platform company integrate think scott mentioned build half vms azure example running linux day shape company really changed perspective relationship announced vmware excited sort 2 component one around azure essentially helping customer move environment using vmware tech hybrid way azure fantastic microsoft 365 point question sort 2 related thing happening one workspace one product product manage oﬃce application mobile device device like android io forth also integrate azure active directory thing like conditional access conditional access really foundational sort security capability word never boston logging device sort detect oh different place kirk let actually throw multifactor auth something along line kind scenario vmware able participate microsoft 365 okay going back survey work seeing recent month lot feedback em growth adoption em strong momentum em maybe talk mobility security fitting part broader microsoft 365 conversation sure sure em enterprise mobility security suite core component microsoft 365 think one 3 leg stool essentially folk aware em essentially 4 core workload q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauerpart suite workload around identity identity core today particularly security perspective although also important way identity used organization sort based security sort thing past identity sort 0 trust identity azure active directory service core em value proposition also value proposition around management management plane em provides us technology called intune managing wide range device io android also part em referenced around security addition identity bunch security value part em whether protecting azure active directory people within directory threat protection capability cloud apps security capability example organization understand saas usage happening inside perimeter inside boundary put policy forth compliance side em also important element protect customer information something called azure information protection part solution number different workload growth business model obviously oﬃce 365 course microsoft 365 increasingly see em sold well good see identity security value proposition referenced earlier crossed 100 million licensed user em really doubling year doubling really really strong growth rate em important battle u okay impressive 100 million let continue path bit getting domain security topic heard satya others microsoft spending lot time think notion marketplace whole world security spend typical company maybe area ineﬃcient spend perhaps many point solution many company charging little much money security arena microsoft kind zoom back take view microsoft thinking security maybe going fit microsoft 365 conversation sure well taking step back area think lot opportunity reason referenced get customer lens hear 1 risk blocker achieving notion digitally transforming business want move cloud want move saas apps want variety different device employee use whatever task working end day really quite concerned risk security front hot topic thing getting way digital transformation q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauerand piece referenced space hard category sense simply enough security professional world keep sort cyber threat referenced highly highly fragmented hundred thousand apps many narrow term many also native solution space see really ripe u tackle making major investment space across board referenced em important think security really think across board term identity think end point end point security meaning across different device whether defender let say window platform taking way across platform mac others course next year think information protection another important part story compliance always come conversation well talking think security super broadly talking csos sec ops literally starting conversation chief risk oﬃcers chief compliance oﬃcers chief legal oﬃcers cfo forth super super invested information protection content within organization investing big time space tough say 1 2 typically whenever conversation around microsoft 365 team come infrastructure customer care management care interop care lot thing really really care security first foremost want talk u would mention brieﬂy announced recently lot work sort compute side microsoft 365 azure also investing deeply space well example azure sentinel product announced rsa conference month back great example space largely fragmented really ripe disruption really ripe using ai across vast amount signal going real differentiator would position sentinel anyone audience totally familiar yes almost think simply think based think tool allows cso sec ops people generally able look across infrastructure signal able identify threat across literally different security system something think almost aggregation layer across across q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauer q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauer q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauerentire estate critical every company quite humble early also really enthusiastic opportunity microsoft going tackle security across level stack core data center endpoint going something extremely overarching sound like pretty well thought yes hope okay let move want touch window 10 know important topic people work think trying ass would peak actual activity typical enterprise going motion upgrading moving environment window 10 feeling peak kind migration activity coming sometime soon coming next kind month handful month view opportunity kind drive additional customer adopt window 10 already done yes right term context within year window 7 reaching end support within really 12 18 month way oﬃce 2010 reaching end support creating real nice tailwind u really important need customer get current get modern desktop window oﬃce window side specifically question say probably roughly halfway sort upgrade cycle quite bit room work left go really important customer really important u perspective latest greatest value window also conversation lower tco secure operating environment customer window 10 term adding additional security value top notion getting current benefit also really important term infrastructure way customer approaching customer course upgrade existing machine many buy new window 10 machine refresh cycle next 12 month really quite bit activity space kirk much would thinking growth versus pc market point cycle q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauer q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauer q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbaueryes share much would say folk expect growth rate line market essentially performance last couple quarter sort consistent 5.5 minute left let check audience question would raise hand going get microphone back room lunchtime okay pretty packed room fact needed room twice big lot hand going quite yet well come back come back moment let try ask final one broad topic innovation future investment heard satya talking using term `` tech intensity feel like might coined one think notion company going increasingly going adopt software technology kind maintain competitive edge spoken going kind driving microsoft today future go back last earnings call amy talking investing pretty aggressively upcoming fiscal year fiscal try capture opportunity want think microsoft 365 right play notion innovation future investment yes good one would go back chatted little bit think top 2 thing hearing customer interested really get around create sort modern experience end user team forefront shifting r resource team increasing number seller team folk customer success around working channel make sure incentive aligned properly recruiting partner build kind isv solution forth huge investment around team across board many different dimension really big 12 18 month team think security talked little bit sort similar profile investing quite bit security space r sale channel partner q mark ronald murphy q unidentified participant kirk koenigsbauerinvesting quite bit investment making well top 2 would highlight thing like talking important year modernizing desktop window 7 end support oﬃce 2010 end support within sort next fiscal year next 12 18 month growth company important customer also important u get customer modern allows u better job selling higher tier service forth lot ai space underneath investment talked every single one product benefiting ai opportunity use ai make product better make relevant help people automation everything automation insight identifying threat security side helping lawyer ediscovery process reducing cost using ai sort really front center referenced couple example thing quite bullish idea delivering within team using power apps power platform specific line business

another way extent people use team much le use yes question come bunch far different product term problem trying go solve outlook combination outlook exchange online forth going around long time people use sort ubiquitous way reach sort whether anyone inside organization anyone outside organization growth rate term usage continue go continue increase rate seeing growth something like team expect around long long time team use case little bit different team really designed around work individual work broad set collection team part work environment probably member q mark ronald murphy kirk koenigsbauerdo know 40 different team participate conversation sort ongoing time sort use team sort tick stay current share content information team many way hub much hub say teamwork whereas outlook much sort pure tool communication calendaring forth get notification team activity show calendar information inside team meeting scheduling quite bit integration talked little bit earlier bot example sort write spot approach write bot show team show inside outlook going increasing integration think essentially 2 different use case well said apology multiple question run time kirk want thank kindly sharing vision insight spending time u great awesome thank thank
