torture guy anything let see know way way talk happening computing right would characterize perfect storm one hand new computing model taking hand new computing approach found almost like simultaneous beginning two different thing simultaneous ending two others know general purpose microprocessor wo take u rest way think understand well computing approach working decade called gpu accelerated computing real promise type problem gpu computing solves happens exactly important problem want solve today whether ai car robotics cloud computing happens happens perfect place perfect time guess perfect storm serendipity meet destiny think feeling right time thing done thing done company really feel good decision decision business model architecture company first layer horizontal advance computing platform first principle architect processor system system software algorithm work application provider one domain target target large domain like example video game industry 100 billion large automotive industry quite large say automotive mean autonomous vehicle quite large healthcare large manufacturing large medium entertainment large target vertical vertical go deep vertical work major help incorporate computing approach workﬂow first time met carl bass probably would say 10 year ago 0 gpu accelerated application autodesk autocad completely rendered cpu everything completely cpu based one drop gpu code first time met chuck adobe software accelerated code adobe software accelerated completely cpu thinking moving simds ssc good reason time gpu adoption really low time gpu adoption really low point develop software run solve chicken egg problem job first strong conviction architecture stuck cuda 9 right every one cuda backward babble cudas every one gpus planet run every single cuda every single permutation matter find gpu architecturally compatible discipline stay fairly significant undertaking believe whole bunch work nobody using long time stuck stuck reason stuck curve mind experiencing future mean future wo come believed believe dennard scaling going stop first principal say going stop knew knew much instruction level parallelism harvest could see knew multiply 2 thing together going see present knew knew know something hard part something something really really really painful fully realizing future still present nobody care hard stuck every single

today people want choice want either buy data center system want buy service public cloud said available everywhere kind strategy strategy action let show work 3 major category accelerated datacenter first classic one accelerated computing best way think market top 500 today 1.2x exaﬂops installed top 500 system oak ridge national laboratory riken national laboratory china largest supercomputing center forth 500 coral going nation united state fastest supercomputer predicting next year 1.7x exaﬂops 1.7x exaﬂops 1.2x top 500 one interesting data point think nation said going exascale every continent every country every subsegment computing whether weather earthquake climate want need genomics need reach exascale postulate maybe first exascale computer somewhere 2020 2022 year later exascale computer work somewhere year 2020 8 exaﬂops computing top 500 course calculate number process price paid exaﬂop computing turn best calculation point time 4 billion last year said market probably opportunity 3 billion nvidia convinced based application better value delivered reach indeed look problem getting bigger problem getting bigger think opportunity 4 billion people buy accelerated system molecule convened modeled faster 273 nanosecond computing going done amber supercomputer whereas previously used 7 nanosecond protein interacting know protein going interact body classic jac benchmark see system 19 rack computing done 1 rack pascal p100 word saving 13 million per instance saving huge customer reason single performance computing rfp request proposal require number accelerator gpus many specify 100 acceleration see future application accelerated want buy something going last 3 five year research community make sense go acceleration give example national national center supercomputing application ncsa hosted uiuc university illinois champaign blue water time 2012 decided 27,000 node would 5,000 node accelerated 1 gpu 1 gpu per node sort well turn saved 20 million hour computing would otherwise done gpu interesting thing point time decided go richer number gpus ncsa blue water turn instead saving 20 million hour computing would saved 50 million hour computing amazing even application run cpu system obviously need beauty time value supercomputer actually increase application accelerated interesting market right every single computing center embracing ai riken japan national laboratory host computer world called k computer 24 rack run ai supercomputer fastest currently available facility japan ai research community japan made huge commitment improving ai research base titech run tsubame supercomputer announced third generation always nvidia gpus third generation japan fastest ai supercomputer probably fastest ai supercomputer world installed shortly reason put saturnv supercomputer 28 top 500 right important thing saturnv besides really really good ai deep learning machine 1 green 500 came within whisker magic number 10 gigaﬂops computing per watt energy simply eﬃcient computer planet really amazing result last least example happening computing ai everywhere computing candle cancer deep learning environment set national laboratory nci national cancer institute dataset dataset together deep learning framework made available nih researcher help u find cure cancer faster traditional way deep learning help cure cancer reason segment important segment u scientific research community embracing deep learning artificial intelligence let talk opportunity deep learning training deep learning training everywhere alexa amazon assistant trained nvidia gpus cortana trained nvidia gpus google voice accelerated nvidia gpus neural network gone superhuman microsoft resnet took image recognition imagenet superhuman accuracy baidu deep speech took speech recognition superhuman accuracy google nmt neural machine translation taken simultaneous machine translation superhuman accuracy neural network trained using nvidia gpus heart one framework people talk whether cognitive toolkit caffe2 mxnet way think training data data happens new way think data image video sort 30 image per second course motion sort interesting thing happen result thing going video speech speech text course speech becomes phrase language language context meaning course medicine every doctor trained dictate note doctor language mean parent doctor doctor language dramatically different way speak neural network medicine trained different way people say `` hi training training time training training going go forever datasets get larger larger question big opportunity way jensen already explained taken training time instance sort always say used month day week day going week hour le shift train humongously complicated neural network completely within reach training value proposition ultimately example worked using system assuming could even right would take 500 hour training gpu server work okay data scientist worth well worth lot gladiator people going get best job 500 hour time worth lot money huge improvement productivity helping enterprise get trained neural network market whatever shape looking look sizing market sort said well right see customer kind buying 1.4 exaﬂops training computing u right past year based growth curve see term people using neural network often train predict something like 55 exaﬂops training happen time get 2020 size market number way assume much many ﬂops processor many processor per system et cetera et cetera average price would make assumption could sized 16 billion could sized 13 billion conservative thought okay think point time best forecast growing 11 billion based real data real adoption rate course assume people early adopter people opinion leader people early majority people late majority sort adoption cycle go model think 11 billion market opportunity nvidia new market seeing inference happening result trained neural network every time say `` okay google want answer really quickly every time amazon alexa jd dingdong bot want ai give answer relatively short time want waiting hour new thing time inferencing course assume network latency say something phone type something pad digital assistant whatever go go data center come back sometimes thing get done edge pretty complicated simplest way think right inferencing happening conventional server server people using fpgas vast majority server saw tensorrt value proposition tensorrt together pascal indeed volta much powerful think starting get disruptive jensen shared 15 16 rack replaced 1 rack pascal 12 rack replaced 1 rack okay inferencing within 7 millisecond trained neural network look thing say `` hi could save 2 million next time looking inferencing server data center strong value proposition people starting adopt inferencing using accelerated computing capability traditional voice image textual search speaking already gave example sort medical dictation lawyer dictating brief customer also huge play video analytics deepu share talk implementation smart city safety security large opportunity traditional hyperscale server oh dataset way think 3.6 trillion search google 3.6 trillion search andrew ng say 25 search going voice image search going increase time right say okay many search going many inference going future know seen explosion facebook live seen explosion term number photo uploaded size photo quality photo datasets put getting bigger bigger time get genomic datasets personalized medicine targeted therapy datasets going become way way large calculation said okay right seems something like 50 56 trillion inference per second based google search 3.6 trillion scale company 56 trillion inference per second think based datasets size growing probably going go 10x around 500 trillion 450 trillion best estimate point time need work well equate term rack obviously going way fewer rack going inferencing way faster speed latency requirement probably going go lower lower network conservatively size 15 billion fine think inferencing large new opportunity u data center first customer already deployed pascal p4 inferencing great product yesterday announcement ifly tech speech inferencing translator little speech assistant found 50x better p4 current inferencing service course ifly tech 1 billion user service service embedded car people putting embedded dingdong jd ai assistant jd alexa kind like alexa platform speech recognition already deployed p4 data center could take u term industry already shared people industry job work key inﬂuencers discover diﬃcult problem apply accelerated computing wanted share might term health care opportunity could right first thing think detection u mri ct ultrasound world medicine full image many many company looking whether ophthalmic image ultrasound looking solve apply deep learning solve imaging problem use case detection looking traditional thing everyone talk deep learning anomaly detection hear word everywhere anomaly detection case imaging detecting issue assisting radiologist doctor clinician identify show possible anomaly ge ultrasound great customer cardiac group ek electrocardiogram guy called eric steen gtucs last nine year like cuda fellow decided apply technique deep learning technique identify imaging coming echocardiogram allow technician get best image present doctor treadmill echocardiogram lot noise image got identify best one show cardiologist part test example detection example diagnosis massachusetts general hospital working basically figure better diagnose prostate cancer 1 8 men get prostate cancer likely get prostate cancer huge image scanning problem figure enough radiologist job united state think 1 radiologist every 100,000 people 6 1 million think number may country like india china way fewer radiologist per person need scan everybody radiologist need able know likelihood person might need tested prostate cancer way cheaper imaging biopsy want mgh working dataset trying solve important problem diagnosing prostate cancer better finally treatment deep genomics really interesting taking whole problem gene gene 3 billion

complete computing solution stack automotive outlined opportunity u outlined partner partnering one thing want point one reason investor day gtc opportunity go actually see ground see actually happening beyond slide beyond thing say let give sense happening gtc term important solution developing developing full stack open important people kind activity happening top nvidia automotive solution give sense 245 separate company registered gtc automotive company specifically work nvidia using computing solution ai stack fact open build top solve myriad number problem give sense 35 vehicle maker call vehicle maker carmaker 20 carmaker john deere looking develop autonomous vehicle use ai harvest field eﬃciently whole bunch number vehicle final mile autonomous vehicle within factory truck paccar daf looking autonomous solution solve particular problem eﬃciently safely 24 tier 1 37 10 hd mapping company 42 presentation actually went sat chair would able see automotive presentation kind give feel importance work affect outside world value building outside world building top take look data beyond revenue accomplished past year still historical course mostly nature mostly infotainment significant data right past year launched drive px 2 platform see growth platform fundamentally people started using drive px lot people working pc trunk developed cuda take software port drive px 2 particular note see last chart q4 fy introduced tensorrt ai compiler automotive industry see number company developing ai almost tripled went 60 170 different company people basically looking `` need tremendous amount computation need ai solution develop start serious work seeing explosion occurred soon released technology drive px 2 know talked 4 processor board 2 parker 2 gp106 powerful processor end year replaced one single xavier soc platform build work going amazing give indication type thing matter think matter think everyone universally recognized autonomous vehicle different ada autonomous vehicle require several thing first conventional code suﬃcient requires completely new computing model achieve goal autonomous vehicle need deep learning secondly reason many hd mapping company gtc process creating hd map diﬃcult requires tremendous amount point cloud processing requires tremendous amount ai result generating hd map something nvidia uniquely automotive industry hd map essential car finally reason drive px 2 exists reason building xavier reason need tensor core architectural breakthrough jensen introduced morning small footprint available everybody level processing required take care computation task algorithm required car okay reason break car extremely hard starting perception amount object detect whether sign lane pedestrian landmark fact process data reason something data plan drive localize hd map lot inferencing ai computing ai believe requirement get level autonomous vehicle look one common question get `` difference solution today fundamentally exists today road ada assist advanced driver assistance system next step beyond first step autonomous vehicle would level level 3 vehicle fundamentally go much beyond detection aside detecting localize inaudible create occupancy grid word take object detect create 3d map around car know next course navigate way drive way take account vehicle dynamic computation drive extremely complex take account weight car egomotion prius handle differently audi factor taken consideration course vehicle simply possible take advantage benefit ai able gather data learn without capability update saw previously one advantage nvidia engaged many different industry take best learn industry leverage automotive result fact maintain update system 100 million gamers geforce mean understand system need work apply automotive like inferencing learning training thing beyond level 3 level 4 introduces entirely new level complexity introduces concept fail operation something happens computer steering braking thing backup fail operational solution requires tremendous amount autonomy basically driver required paying attention mean computer able drive maintain autonomy able handle situational awareness like construction scene ce saw demonstration technology navigate cone construction sign pulled front path car thing ai deep learning different kind algorithm redundancy benefit necessary implement car imagine complexity typical urban environment amount object detect kind complex requires tremendous increase amount processing required reason invested started investing many year ago xavier chip xavier chip us volta gpu core jensen talked morning required believe deliver kind processing talking kind driving talking processing order 30 trillion operation per second achieve level beyond vision car driving ai always idea ai car car copilot guardian angel running number application within car monitor driver make sure driver go harm application like face tracking head detection lipreading gaze tracking thing algorithm believe running ai car end result believe requirement tremendous amount dnns deep neural network running together tremendous amount processing make whole thing happen one strategy talked morning order system like one advantage nvidia approach delivering platform fact everything shanker talked training side something supply example typical ﬂow developing car car would start survey car drive px collecting data taking data bringing data factory label data annotate properly lot expertise train dnn eﬃciently going use train deep neural network system opportunity course already seeing automotive company buying ddx system training also mapping company map processing create hd map car using point think announced every single mapping company partnership working solve problem information result training ota ota server final result go car computer full software stack thing mentioned earlier detection localization driving ai complete platform something develop use develop stack something ecosystem world also need order uniquely expertise product aside car talked developing full open platform developing full platform open offer

development solution announced number partnership morning heard course toyota think one significance different announcement made seeing adoption ai kind system company regard quality safety fundamental thing company given speculative risk lot company like bosch zetef toyota company capability take technology capability scale make available anywhere world believe powerful indicator future success growth valuableness requirement technology platform built also announced mentioned every hd mapping partner also understand requirement order deliver hd map look opportunity number different way slice fundamentally view opportunity segment automotive market artificial intelligence computing required market exist within segment talked abi research number targeting number 5 million level 4/5 15 million car level level 3 basically level 4 level 5 paint type car today car 7 pc trunk room trunk anything okay idea something fail operational capability tremendous amount processing requires multiple processor enormous amount software capability operating vehicle level level 3 something capable right parker solution type design capable delivering right ai car capability right conservatively assign roughly level level 4 5 ultimately believe ai car capability capability demonstrated demo morning kind capability believe grand lot application look currently today drive car advanced driving capability traﬃc jam assist extremely compelling solution ability car drive even traﬃc extremely valuable compelling attach rate type system within manufacturer high believe something matter lot attach rate overall opportunity okay key takeaway believe automotive opportunity first autonomous vehicle believe require ai nvidia position believe think understand center ai result look around gtc look work company nvidia center work strategy build deliver system already seeing auto company building buying dgx building deep learning system mapping company using nvidia hd mapping processing fundamentally company coming event like gtc take advantage expertise able deliver solve problem need solve building full open software stack top powerful processing platform solution product delivering market advantage one architecture one software interface scalable level level 3 way level 4 level 5 easy say hard developing ecosystem developing sdks working company see gtc easy say hard took u long time get point look around get feel type energy development work going top work think ca anything conclude happening nvidia automotive something important lot company effort develop kind autonomous vehicle okay thank much deepu tallaoh like introduce deepu talla going talk ai city presentation okay good afternoon everyone video today far largest generative data approximately 75 internet traﬃc video across many city world hundred million camera traditionally surveillance purpose capturing data storing 24/7 camera deployed government building traﬃc intersection transportation hub like airport train station mall oﬃces school name many camera deployed safety reason first traditional public safety application like video surveillance law enforcement forensics also seeing increasingly used eﬃciency smart city reason people call smart city essentially using video camera use thing like traﬃc management retail analytics foot traﬃc mall intersection also optimizing resource ai city safe city smart city using power deep learning actually take billion video frame anonymize transform meaningful insight ai city mentioned several hundred million dollar camera already deployed today another half billion camera going coming online next 3 four year end approximately 1 billion camera stream 24/7 2020 today happening camera stream basically going video recorder small fraction video stream watched human being extreme sensitive safety area otherwise basically going recorder something bad happens somebody go review fact want solve problem using human imagine 30 billion frame day basically take 3 billion work shift really practical problem past 10 year video analytics solution proposed solve problem video analytics past challenging condition accuracy never really good enough much inferior human being false alarm actually bigger issue really trying solve problem power deep learning ai seen many many industry application use deep learning solve problem achieving ai city safe city smart city power deep learning let look architecture ai city look like turn actually need edge cloud architecture solve problem show picture first camera installed everywhere right could body camera police oﬃcer could camera deployed parking entrance garage basically building looking license plate would nice camera actually take one level higher imagine airport got hundred camera maybe even 1,000 camera want actually capture data together sort application happens across camera matter right example imagine looking viewpoint camera happening 100 foot away probably relevant happening viewpoint example lost child want track done across camera also equally important across time happened 5 minute ago probably relevant happening right actually powerful server appliance going taking ten hundred camera analysis server take city scale way basically talking cloud infrastructure getting data across multiple precinct block want full public safety like city center looking different area want optimize resource across city traﬃc pattern look like something sort safety reason something bad happening would able look alternate route really solve problem need ai edge also cloud also server announced earlier week platform called nvidia metropolis wherein apply different nvidia product across board way edge cloud heard earlier talk also obviously know 2 piece ai deep learning first piece training creating neural network happening typically cloud train neural network deploy network called inferencing deployment happen even cloud server way edge access camera created platform using software stack starting cuda top unified different software development kit ai create singular platform intelligent video analytics bring ai city metropolis platform typical installation camera video recorder server appliance using tesla platform end server jetson platform camera small recorder typically taking 4 channel 8 channel actually time expo ﬂoor classic example law enforcement police car future police car would look like wherein police car camera front side body cam police oﬃcer amber alert today happens basically police oﬃcers looking something capture something going go back dump data server shift instead showing expo area using power ai process camera stream whether detecting car license plate face body cam actually prevent hopefully prevent something bad happening opposed fact started journey couple year ago started working partner space last year first time server even camera started proof concept ai city smart safety application approximately 10 million revenue last year projecting next year would 100 million revenue inferencing opportunity either server appliance camera even growth 10x growth expect last year next year bulk camera still going think mentioned 500 million camera stream right almost none many camera going deployed year next year many still still early phase transforming human watching video stream going recorder transforming deep learning video analytics even next year think le 5 total stream cumulative stream would going calendar year 2020 think nvidia opportunity 2 billion basically even number stream would increase term much ai going enabled increasingly network capability ai also going increase focused primarily server like thing go process ten hundred thousand channel environment like airport train station building like server also focused thing like small recorder also camera think going 2 billion opportunity u growing fairly fast coming proof concept last year ai city platform metropolis already 50 platform partner announced announced product engagement u many actually gtc showing product many actually started shipping product well example see working traditional video analytics colette m. kressfor almost decade using deep learning ai within year could increase accuracy significantly going 70 80 90 soon expect increase significantly traditionally video analytics done obviously traditional server seeing significant ups like order magnitude 10 30x type using nvidia gpus appliance list partner reason show partner many might recognize name industry pretty fragmented industry many many vertical space many many geography require different solution order address market decided go platform strategy many small customer make ecosystem platform way training inferencing edge cloud providing sdks working different partner launch partner okay basically tell ai city pleasure invite colette cfo nvidia give next presentation okay good afternoon feel like finished talking oh right right last night got opportunity speak earnings really appreciate today keynote morning well investor day going try kind go hopefully heard today answer question speak often key question trying understand key part business always hear size opportunity going forward hopefully got presentation today kind overview key highlight last year really really great year u able grow nearly 2 billion term revenue 6.9 billion growing 38 overall overall gross margin increase period time one year also 240 basis point increase record level well additionally operating income taking look term platform thinking overall investment business surely growth across every single platform able double overall operating income year ago looked back last three year term growth overall business think several year ago came talking transformation transformation thinking differently chip company moving overall platform approach starting see evolved term movement platform started three year ago 4 billion company doubling quite nicely several business overall look term growth platform represented 60 business three year ago still oem ip business nearly 40 overall business right look finished term last year gaming business size total company three year ago added platform top pro vi data center business 2 combined nearly 25 overall business automotive continuing grow reach 6.9 three year overall cagr 20 growth platform growing 35 breaking term market platform looking cagr three year heard fish come talk overall gaming business overall success seen gaming still large growth driver u going forward talked drive overall growth entire ecosystem around gaming tremendously healthy seen u fuel overall ecosystem term geforce experience game developer well see tremendous platform want play best game production value game continued rise period able benefit producing better better technology gaming last year growing 44 yes launched pascal architecture last year saw q3 q4 result even seeing continued growth finished last quarter also strong growth term gaming expect continue go forward think lineup right tremendously fresh lineup full everything 1050 way 1080 ti titan order dazzle overall gamers coming time term thinking well also new game coming fall excited term seen term gaming history well see going forward pro vi business well established nicely seen actually grow last year well saw last quarter term q1 mature business continuing see mobility need workstation mobility need still would right leader industry probably highest market share seen performance quite nicely data center think today everything heard today really focused lot developer really transformation seeing overall computing environment computing environment change gpu computing mean remember data center business one single total business probably 5 different business within deep learning training inference computing sell full system dgx supercomputer also grid business order virtualization overall cloud many different way bringing market well bringing market definitely selling tesla overall platform also ability put together full supercomputer also enable cloud big part growth seen last year moving automotive rob talking great opportunity going forward autonomous yes automotive business today lion share still term infotainment system small piece moving term development process overall development work many car manufacturer others partnership build autonomous driving still majority revenue still benefiting system producing put overall car see overall gaming business cagr 40 pro vi also nicely growing little bit term digit data center growing 60 last three year automotive business growing 70 quite unique position company many strategic growth platform continuing execute one top okay really based underlying architecture enabled u growth margin expansion get lot question still room still room gross margin expansion given seen three year ago 55 finished last year record 59 actually finished q1 59.6 strong really thinking driving overall platform different statement saying based platform value delivering inside platform overall investment term done build much platform approach overall system overall software development included term many system ecosystem around investment opex investment gross margin overall enabling gross margin continue grow probably one biggest driver go forward see slide continued mix change moving growth platform away oem ip business continued help overall gross margin also lift right direction yes still see continuation going forward see slide continued mix change moving growth platform away oem ip business continued help overall gross margin also lift right direction yes still see continuation going forward operating expense operating expense investment called unified architecture approach architecture across different platform quite unique serve platform gamers time running application ai datacenter exact underlying technology yes lot work term building full system software top great overall platform underneath done solid term looking investment continuing find eﬃciencies term work grown 8 last year fiscal year saw latter half last year well going year started increase talked want several quarter term overall growth rate seeing u probably one biggest asks term continuing invest back business answer yes need think continue expand reach large market really investment headcount investing key engineering function building overall platform last 10 year invested 11 billion overall r last 10 year software quadrupled term investment size software actually spend actually underlying hardware term engineering yes continue see u invest invest back business operating margin expansion thinking overall leveraged approach seeing right overall operating margin starting back 2014 16 finished whole fiscal year 32 last quarter 33 doubled doubled margin three year yes still investing going 1 focus make sure right investment great model great model ability grow term top line enable higher gross margin unified approach term opex ability expand margin probably one better metric think bottom line much key building opex focusing cash cash ﬂow used get lot question term cash level u.s. cash level let try highlight key thing period time three year doubling term overall annual cash ﬂow thinking think cash ﬂow make sure want able benefit cash ﬂow also increased cash see overall net cash position slightly nowhere near term overall cash ﬂow key return done term cash collected additionally u.s. cash although change term receive u.s. cash still level even three year ago continuing find new source u.s. cash know jensen hsun huang q w illiam shalom steina high global company receive significant amount profit overseas well capital return key component term shareholder value message continued since restart back 2013 returned 4 billion date overall shareholder represents 85 free cash ﬂow returned shareholder best make sure one invested properly business may investment term opex investment term capital need grow business think investment term may overall help overall business 1 priority choose return much cash ﬂow overall shareholder see u continue driving shareholder value last piece actually bring everybody back stage actually think last three year look overall invested capital business term debt overall equity overall profit gained invested term see nasdaq 100 probably little bit faster look term overall return capital term overall improvement done term since continuing return bottom line overall leverage model seen clear outperform lastly see return term total shareholder return period 800 okay still big component term deliver still lot work lot opportunity grab driving shareholder value probably one key thing okay thank coming going open running little bit behind still plenty time overall q going bring overall speaker heard today jeff fisher schankar rob deepu going see jenson well going bring open light term group able answer question could course talk yesterday let know try gear discussion term heard today keynote anything else might mind okay question answer hi lady gentleman think management team pretty awesome huh guy wow hardly anything stein suntrust thanks much hosting analyst day educational helpful particular sizing opportunity datacenter think something helpful big number fact bigger jensen hsun huangthan intel dcg today think really love maybe idea think future hold architecture datacenter future relative traditional intel architecture server versus gpus new architecture talked today yes thanks first guy know datacenter architecture evolved course last well gosh time industry last 30 year architecture gone vector supercomputing vector massively parallel processor one generation guy heard name went along necessary bring back past vector massively parallel saw simds measured multiprocessing simd machine kind generation silicon valley computer company prior kind east coast prior kind know midwest microprocessor showed one important thing ever happened computer industry announcement pentium fact could 64 bit fact workstation class computer mathematics quite powerful pentium microprocessor made possible single chip really powerful almost custom server consisting multiple asics advantage single chip every single year would pump rode moore law guy know thing created idea called cot okay commodity datacenters idea would build custom server chip mainframe supercomputer completely crushed economics made sense economics made sense intel r budget much 200 million 400 million 500 million high performance computing supercomputing company could possibly afford simply crushed wiped today look supercomputing architecture find vast majority cot look datacenters hyperscale datacenters vast majority cot problem cot problem cot look datacenter pretty much empty space air air separated motherboards sheet metal connected whole bunch cable look cabling alone cabling alone datacenter really quite amazing mean performance computer 2 cable coming back infiniband let say even fiber optic neck fiber optic channel cable couple thousand dollar suppose 300,000 300,000 time 2,000 fair amount idea idea scaling computer like level make sense alternative alternative want know want create computer denser vacuous computer separated air good way design computer want compress lead answer architecture future going denser quite frankly couple rack server demonstrated today replace 500 server would would take entire row computer replace 2 rack would take entire datacenter replace 4 rack kind future course hand hand amount ai going start going start growing 2 q vivek arya jensen hsun huangdynamic going create density another dynamic going create expansion sense going create density faster expand time going see expansion could world need lot computing even logical question whether industry world need computing real question architecture would become really greater question think long time know believe accelerated computing personally believe competent cpu competent cpu connect competent gpus result actually pretty remarkable prefer architecture think going time continue see opportunity processor new computing architecture vivek arya bank america thanks informative analyst day actually one clarification think colette started talking operating margin wanted make sure still committed expanding operating margin understand need investment wanted understand think margin expansion real question datacenter think convinced u training market actually bigger think lot leg inference still going bigger market fact leading training give advantage kind somebody train moved inference stage likely use gpu think still easy move alternative architecture sustainable advantage come inference also said something earlier term commitment let answer question investing opportunity committed investment reason believe ca commit believe margin expansion reason believe margin expansion believe top line opportunity grow faster investment committed investment believe see margin expansion one game one score ca play score want clarify believe enjoy market margin expansion enjoy margin expansion top line revenue growing fast made statement earlier believe true okay statement inferencing larger market reason larger unit larger computing reason take trillion cycle train billion parameter otherwise known neuron weight take trillion cycle train billion weight trillion large number trillion large number know inferencing inference billion notice trillion factor training get trillion billion inferencing billion right got inference either million people simultaneously hit internet infer something network trillion device happens true look total inferencing market today believe approximately small okay inferencing company know talk lot q atif malik jensen hsun huang q srinivas reddy pajjuribecause sexy conversation fact matter evidence going lean think time people going start taking network going start deploying datacenters decided make volta pretty killer inferencing machine mean chart somebody would like build something better first principle pretty hard really really hard question becomes 2.5 billion r budget pick number 0.5 billion r budget go build processor approximately market moment well turn reason processor day job guy understand waiting around inferencing night shift moment day job game away train away hpc away workstation away inferencing market come going right magic work equation work inferencing company today going chasing dollar long time pretty rough suggesting people start company think people ought start company lot atif malik citigroup question gaming little bit surprised pascal refresh upgrade rate 17 look gaming decline guy saw last reported quarter 24 little bit kind seasonal regard peer trying better understand guy think back half year term gaming demand showed 6 7 compound annual growth rate believe third party think rate versus customer like msi taiwan talking 20 gaming sale growth year yes guess number showed term overall market 100 billion software revenue kind strength ecosystem overall gaming gaming hardware growing faster especially notebook mentioned msi big notebook customer one early guess leader term pushing form factor performance notebook space think pascal really kind turbocharged hardware gaming hardware market providing step performance think year good year gaming hardware see seasonality end market appear fairly robust u looking forward fundamental covered esports aaa gaming type thing look continued momentum year srini pajjuri macquarie thanks presentation jensen question competition obviously game town datacenter right look got amd graphic intel variety solution got internal solution well fpgas maybe talk put take look competitor also concerned jensen hsun huang first answer competition question could figure competitor game got figure game playing used different sport franchise nascar business past race around 490 lap last 10 lap chaos think work right eat pizza first 490 lap game really different today much marathon really really play play long game long game done selected market going take least 10 year happen market existed pc graphic chip existed competed rigorously really happy really felt refinement execution system company speed company intense competitive nature company really honed ca successful nascar people audience tracked u long time chose nascar kind started like know many car nascar start 150 company u lap chaos chaos remained precision company ability really hone art high level today playing long game selected market large far far market software intensive nothing window got nothing industry standard got nothing component really software problem invested course last 10 year massive amount software software company today software company today could one hand solve ai computing problem like nobody hand create car hand could train robot alternative universe software company ca graphic chip gave graphic chip could put stage say `` train robot wo sit like graphic chip boot window think company different company today compete different people different market believe really 2 platform today car u intel believe different approach different approach think 10 trillion market going 2 platform people choose architected differently case ai question people want take battle ai going huge going future software going future computing strategist would take game would take different part ai go endeavor new frontier focus competitor ai really expansion market market expand fast enough investment level becomes high right mean investing high hard would like market expand fortunately market expanded quite nicely imperative u one reason much thing called deep learning institute teach deep learning world partner microsoft partner google partner company coming u help educate world deep learning engineer going educate 100,000 engineer year would like create future engineer take advantage new art form q mitchell toshiro steves jensen hsun huang q toshiya harithis new computing way also want make sure end point end point completely democratize ability inferencing point design got world best engineer building world best cpu basically reason want proliferate quickly possible consumption network side sooner somebody put dla lamppost fantastic somebody put speaker fantastic would like expand market competitor core ai market consumption unlike lot company building point course take starting experience different different market mitch steves rbc 2 question first datacenter side seems like implied message ai actually probably going faster growing piece case mean essentially growing faster 186 saw latest quarter secondly automotive side one case hard time understanding trained car prevents moving something like dsp lower powered chip know drive versus using gpu welll first dsp way le eﬃcient gpu ca imagine deep learning dsp see saying mean something dsp particularly think 2 different acronym gpu least benefit tensor instruction dsp right dsp actually good time sequence digital signal processing use audio deep learning massively parallel problem array matrix multiplies want really happen almost simultaneously think gpu actually quite uniquely wonderful architecture really quite uniquely wonderful add deep learning finesse add deep learning data format deep learning specific instruction actually included deep learning computational array right cuda cuda cuda 9 cuda one computing architecture quite extensible extending since beginning every single year add new thing one architectural innovation started beginning company really carried proud invested think way think xavier designed deep learning inferencing ai computing car scratch built people use xavier car likely use coffee machine going xavier work car going use cell phone example helpful dedicated one thing run entire software stack car toshiya hari goldman sachs thank much opportunity today think provided tam forecast business gaming jeff think ran growth driver collectively group jeffrey d. fisher jensen hsun huang unidentified speaker jensen hsun huangappreciate help u translate growth driver actual number next say 3 five year would much appreciated well specific tam graphic think look total pc market area investing platform little hard put upper bound geforce example get u outside get u outside traditional market adding value moving value chain term providing gamers total software tam 100 billion jon peddie say hardware tam 30 billion monitor guess hard put specific tam tie back business today know would want add ... three billion people would done three billion people believe tenure arc career another 50 year believe healthy enjoy job plenty 50 year believe question mind every human become gamer think logical reasonable every human watch television parent generation 10 probably generation give example one mean hard find another form entertainment difference course form entertainment computationally intensive therefore delivery vehicle delivery medium hard reason cartridge look like supercomputer geforce cartridge look like supercomputer step solving problem able provision service virtualized way going still take u several year fish mentioned geforce created reach everyone question many gamers world top world top fundamental gaming platform provider almost rule almost say absolute certainty one think everybody room would say yes pretty yes would go along pretty darn sure going one platform maker gaming someday kind hard imagine 3 billion 3 billion many serve serve sure absolutely going table absolutely sure strategy made okay everyone last question like much fun hosting reception management team right last question q matthew d. ramsay jensen hsun huang colette m. kress jensen hsun huang q ambrish srivastava jensen hsun huang matt ramsay canaccord know shankar jensen guy want take great thing company guy one common gpu platform across business seen benefit currently able generate significantly higher asp piece business think particularly datacenter think justified benefit customer get want ask little bit get scale tam guy laid feel pricing datacenter space ability segment product portfolio move forward perspective going forward first idea pricing somehow higher certain segment right reason think cost wrong think cost wrong nvidia cost chip chip least cost chip cost cd rom microsoft cost software company information company cost human cost variable chip variable sometimes inventory sometimes le inventory engineer employed everyday really cost think perspective datacenter business pretty high cost cost much much higher per unit geforce example geforce sell ten million datacenters yet investing real number advancing datacenters cost different want let one business think first principle business model make business work price accordingly far concerned frankly think well operating margin geforce obviously quite good let see question food drink know little overrated food drink keep question sound good shawn like investor police ambrish bmo thank jensen laid vision ai pretty compelling never doubted wanted move mundane topic like ar inventory free cash ﬂow augmented reality mundane come let talk q ambrish srivastava colette m. kress q brett simpson jensen hsun huang touch well colette account receivable going back last night get chance ask question account receivable 18 11 even basis pretty large increase inventory going well help u understand expecting ar well inventory go forward let highlight ar ar always inﬂuenced term timing new product whether beginning quarter whether middle quarter whether end quarter never issue term collection team really look end month like shift think need necessarily concerned timing term ar inventory talked couple thing morning coming important term part inventory look understand term inventory probably 1/3 quarter inventory significant amount business front u business term datacenter many different architecture continuing sell well gaming business well automotive business reality inventory level size company actually quite reasonable actually low enough term feel comfortable probably key thing timing within concerned brett simpson arete research couple question datacenter first jensen wanted get perspective cpu accelerating lot workload always hosted xeons particularly deep learning training interface cpu gpu obviously holding back system performance question circumvent xeon particularly work done nvlink power9 develop cpu license power9 instead got well power9 really fantastic cpu question work done power9 well processor unparalleled great processor hand hand x86 ecosystem really rich mean lot body work top x86 intel architecture quite rich use product use develop software run nvidia run x86 run intel ashamed great processor select good one term datacenters think datacenters use intel energy eﬃciency good mean fact matter craftsmanship intel xeons great practically people know one going violate rule say okay know anybody could actually give cpu q brett simpson jensen hsun huang q trip chowdhryaway free company still lower total cost ownership intel say something craftsmanship software code completely gone world likely likely intel xeons fantastic use circumvent pci express kind technique kind technique intel also advancing pci express gen 4 comfortable connection okay follow last question datacenter pricing mean clear got sell talked saving offer customer replacing cpu gpu acceleration scale gpu business particularly large hyperscalers concentrated set buyer going forward given big public cloud becoming guess approaching 100 million year gpu compute guy today look next 2 three year going buying lot product guy sustainable think current pricing getting gpu specific set customer first thing save money save million dollar save million dollar way possible without ecosystem built application ported shankar said top 450 hpc application planet ported get ported every day richness ecosystem allows able accelerate application reduce cost reduce cost investing couple 100,000 save 10 save 2 million server probably 1 million cable okay math math event able event run kind application 0 0 successful basically either help people save million dollar get considered opportunity even little bit nothing nothing pricing largely ecosystem come along software spec come along hear going fine invested company close 10 billion gpu computing long long gpu computing value carrying cuda chip shared memory dragging gross margin decade question got ecosystem mentioning earlier conviction go build ecosystem got u secondarily investment making today richness ecosystem software stack allows application decrease cost application ported accelerated ca benefit okay think nothing mean value exchange 2 organization fantastic quite frankly year breaking even investment jensen hsun huang q trip chowdhry jensen hsun huang q unidentified participant jensen hsun huangtrip chowdhry global equity research two quick question first know new industry evolving emerging positive shift database database especially columnar database company booth question driving sdk anything else ecosystem grow number one second question ... yes okay little slight detail come second question like sdk giving benchmark giving nvgraph cublas cudnn cuda whole bunch software engineer help optimize software think industry take two year three year sure know graph analytics one important thing could sea dark data sit company idea turn unstructured messy data something reasonable could take data plummet directly todd mostak mapd process way okay could take goop ram one dgxs running mapd going go figure going figure little bit software going go figure relationship everything everything else result create corporate graph going essentially corporate facebook except people thing able find interaction relationship trend way people amazing graph believe everybody going believe everybody going going say sql database hadoop database place people really want harness take data underground really use apply graph optimization analytics apply ai people really going want think company like walmart ge people lot data find relationship going need say enterprise database going go away computing going come think today really serving file maintaining number employee number part number dollar kind thing erp system today new town hpc department enterprise understand yet hpc coming start database performance graph analytics deep learning ai top machine learning q james wang jensen hsun huang q stacy aaron rasgonon top coming think going future really yes young man saw tv day made proud james wang ark invest jensen talked xavier thought surprising radical announcement seen guy long time maybe talk u thought process going r model qualcomm model going able download blueprint xavier revenue model previously talked ip line business involved fit together kind went like think xavier dla guy think everybody go `` damn right took like mean james know decision get made sit around talk problem trying solve accelerate expansion adoption deep learning lot asic company know deep learning really work right see mathematics see know end end know design end end many market never going design product never going believe going trillion trillion deep learning chip little tiny tpu thing asics going sprinkled like dust world going go build thing going go build refrigerator chip somebody going go build coffeemaker chip somebody going go build right microphone chip somebody want make possible people going build without without u able build using ip using ip created really supereﬃcient already baked pull deep learning market couple 2 three year couple 2 three year thought expansion deep learning market would help one conversation earlier competitor worry question competition told competition nonconsumption well competition nonconsumption cry something 2 thing nonconsumption invested deep learning institute call dli invested deep learning accelerator called dla making 2 available fairly affordably case dla sourced royalty royalty take use write home mostly expand market yes stacy rasgon bernstein talked customer investing hundred thousand stave 10 million guess light view rise accelerated compute helping increase overall spend compute mechanism better utilize gain eﬃciency spend already guess put another way think opportunity think opportunity benefiting shift architecture term jensen hsun huangof current spend actually going versus ability need actually increase overall spend compute today yes sean sic stacy great question fact look almost exactly like market adoption curve new technology somehow radically different past movie saw time look exactly like first customer adopt technology adopted technology choice needed simulate something fast ca get done research grant run money job one researcher told work invited lab see supercomputer say `` jensen work able life work lifetime imperative know choice need time machine choice need warp speed second group second generation people used gpus possible way crazy nut cost prohibitive let give example titan oak ridge titan financially possible without gpus choice budget much money choice use accelerator first take big chance jeff nichols quoted volta probably jeff nichols took massive chance move one nation open science supercomputing center accelerated computing nobody thought time huge chance big courageous move soon course everybody else discovered problem enough money ca build datacenter large enough datacenters supercomputer get awfully large ca build facility large enough ca provision power impossible provision power simply enough money reduction size compression talking earlier future architecture look like reduction size compression everything money saved allowed create supercomputer worthy built remember way go get grant 0.5 billion say `` hi would like build supercomputer almost fast 900 top supercomputer planet way build something meaning build something allows deliver capability nation simply new idea would possible new technology deep learning new generation researcher jumped top platform great idea would practical probably someday gpu would practical today jumped gpu like crazy seeing largest market people called tipping point people called mainstream market code ported start going mainstream everybody look go `` need run code list 10 application run based architecture cost much money throughput 10 application based architecture much cost throughput spreadsheet simple get 1 2 answer constant spend meaning got budget got spend 10 million know got got would like highest throughput event q stacy aaron rasgon jensen hsun huang colette m. kress shawn simmons colette m. kress q unidentified participanttrying deliver throughput customer budget conscious would like figure way spend le money save money basically 2 type customer shankar deal today want increase throughput budget want deliver throughput lower budget part market quite large experiencing today believe next phase next phase exact thing enjoyed pc mobile device first got first showed everybody go `` nah 700 think going segment really business executive luxury computing example remember back good old day pc first came go `` yes market probably know 100,000 going see seeing thing turn provide capability something like deep learning find value power automation automation use realize much productivity unleashes company i.e save money going buy really believe reason much confidence expand market market computing going continue expand market expansion computer industry applying machine learning going cause u reduce spend area like ca believe certain waste transportation waste container waste warehousing waste parking lot waste fossil fuel waste name going reduce waste waste time waste people thing going reduce waste way going going shift spend computing capability company next phase expansion market hopefully enjoy differently one phase sean sic stacy answer question good question think went marketing 101 business revolutionary business 101 stacy yes think answer right sorry thanks stacy get one last one okay get shawn award give yes jensen hsun huangthis question autonomous driving jensen said earlier 2 platform intel assume mean also mobileye also said going big market question think approach might superior maybe summarize different approach different approach going tell u approach might get bigger portion market think 5 six year whether going well two appraches different approach based computing approach processor programmable know cuda architecture computing architecture gpu dla programmable architecture everything context computer reason 240 200 company able take computing platform add value also first realize realized deep learning right way go three year rest market building deep learning platform xavier everything based deep learning traditional computer vision go along suggesting solution work know robust diverse able handle condition require data data available criticism deep learning past largely vaporized either maturity workﬂows maturity engineer well creation processor dedicated one thing called xavier xavier world first processor designed one job optimized job drive trouble know type sucker designed one job one job high risk/high return strategy course moderated risk built entire stack understand software well owned software see software moderated risk pretty high risk nobody semiconductor company would know nuance went xavier approach combination custom asics computer vision traditional computer vision chip deep learning capability future largely still computer vision chip fpgas surround couple general purpose cpu think two approach one based aii computing platform rather coherent opinion one collection integrated chip cobble enough capability tow approach different result choice computing platform programmable meaning could actually get drive px2 make attempt program q unidentified participant jensen hsun huang colette m. kress jensen hsun huangyou ca acutally one acrhitecture actually large car company take computing stack add differentiation ca approach difference going find success find success indisceernible validates approach well 200 company validated approach know one conservative company world slow careful done detailed analysis imagine toyota chosen drive px ehy choice everything tell something term ratio 74/26 would like close always good goal okay well guy extraordinary time thanks time spent u attention paying company really honored thanks investor room great support beginning okay thank
