right good morning joe moore morgan stanley semiconductor team happy u today colette kress nvidia colette thanks coming thank cfo nvidia let walk take 30 minute walk business portfolio little bit time audience question question answer let start gaming gaming business 57 revenue grew 36 last year pretty impressive year really without product cycle big product cycle number year said sort 3 component core gaming mobile nintendo business also cryptocurrency like talk maybe question term gaming year without product cycle strong year talk driver strength perceive growth segment q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kresssure remind everyone market segment company really based one single product term gpu 4 market segment partaken using overall gpu span gaming overall business pro visualization taking graphic enterprise data center business quite front center last couple year focus term accelerated computing accelerated computing ai well accelerated computing computing many piece last business automotive business sister much work term new data center working term future autonomous car going forward pause term gaming business gaming business one strongest part portfolio longest standing grew company based graphic inside pc earlier gaming great use case overall graphic seen tremendous growth last year probably last 3 five year term growth lot necessarily underlying piece hardware specific overall market overall growth seen market gaming gaming really transformed last decade tremendously gaming used place would partake term gaming inside living room overall pc moved overall social platform social platform added gamers new age starting younger staying longer ability play friend online particular interest overall platform gaming leader term pc stand probably largest market share overall pc gamers platform although second year still strength different kind platform could buy additionally key term inﬂuencing overall upgrade cycle adoption overall gaming platform really looking overall game hitting market tremendous amount great popular game inﬂuences gamers use opportunity upgrade platform whether u.s. whether europe worldwide even asia pac area strong game one key area see inﬂuencing overall growth probably key underlying piece term growth think last year great talked competitive esports sort esports driver think drive hardware sale obviously small group participant playing streaming competitive game seems like pervasive benefit broader base gamers sure think esports esports really inﬂuencing watching overall game overall community watching best breed term overall gamers learning key trick term showing play essentially spectator sport term gaming different though people inﬂuencing friend inﬂuence actually buying hardware top gear top inﬂuencers term gaming popular well gamers well q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kressmany case life know purchase overall equipment gear match best breed term gamers seeing whole inﬂuence term gamers also inﬂuence overall gaming developer term building everybody watching overall key feature inside game determine need build next okay great one area talked recently mobile notebook pretty gaming experience fairly thin light notebook evolution business yes think overall mobility front around several year key watch need term mobility form thin light people going change go backwards thin light really key key feature also interested performance matching 2 together one key proponent done many oems around world leading good current cycle term pascal latest overall architecture seeing gaming notebook exclusively using thin light using high performance allows gamer go anywhere sure still many desktop type infrastructure incorporate monitor screen controller mobility type gaming notebook key early stage seeing overall rollout think overall oems like also brings tremendous value term selling notebook overall industry okay great one question gaming sense operating fairly environment last two month availability product retail typically msrp point guess entirely cryptocurrency created situation running business situation decide allocate sort tighter supply environment prioritizing thing talk end fourth quarter finished discussed challenge right term supply constrained term channel channel inﬂuenced strength overall gaming seen overall holiday season also large uptick seen overall valuation cryptocurrency inﬂuenced buying cryptocurrency board available also moving stack using overall gpus lot cryptocurrency mining trying serve market overall gpus became supply constrained going look forward best thing necessarily allocation allocation q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kressparticularly gaming gpus largely geared towards gamers want make sure gamers worldwide receive card want working quite fast term partner supplier term picking overall supply get overall channel yes short term seen retail price potentially little bit higher something overall benefit primarily channel provider benefiting already sold overall unit okay helpful guess topic cryptocurrency guy done pretty good job trying help u understand impact course last quarter also said hard quantify always know particularly since moved away specialized chip maybe towards geforce guess think business obviously great business want take advantage think modeling move course year thing like expectation fairly prudent long term go think really goal overall company significantly large tam front u executing associated gaming associated data center associated driving car assured manage overall tam able serve going first overall priority case cryptocurrency believe serve primarily specialized card going goal going forward volatility short term overall price mining overall profitability merge overall gaming going really try hardest really focus overall gpus gaming overall gamers going forward becomes challenging u u determine exactly much mining sometimes see gamer actually term gaming overall mining going forward see u continue focus building specific card overall mining think best breed quite easily given overall ability produce many different type gpus market okay little tricky talking year look like guy typically talk product come typically cadence would assume product coming course year yet situation inventory extremely low moment anything think context term going manage rest year combination constrained inventory new product q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kressyes historically architecture kept everybody toe preannounce product like excite overall gamers overall cadence probably 2 2.5 year last several different architectural increase done still even met overall mark term overall pascal bar market still remember best breed term overall performance anything market still selling quite quite well going continue focus move forward stay tuned see term announcing much later okay great shifting gear talk hpc cloud data oriented business 133 growth last year 20 revenue pretty pretty solid think obviously great opportunity give u little bit overview around business know multiple segment multiple different way parse give u little bit overview thinking sure last several year increased overall data center business looking 1.9 billion business finished last fiscal year business really broken 5 different piece underlying fundamental say move forward think overall range cpu benefit future term architecture much upward movement term overall goal using acceleration using gpu acceleration front center relates overall data center business seen emergence acceleration term one business computing data center business also seen data center expand tremendously focused artificial intelligence new technique solve modern ai seeing deep learning primary focus deep learning form training overall data one key underlining business overall training training started overall performance computing cloud service provider using internal application still remains significant part business additionally last 24 month seen overall growth term cloud instance giving opportunity many ai researcher enterprise get quick access ability ai without overall infrastructure seen overall cloud second business also grow quite nicely 3 thinking training overall cloud computing majority data center business emerging type business within well fourth one thinking inferencing business inferencing looking ai incremental data perspective ability use overall gpu scenario well already trained data still early stage large market front u fifth one thinking ai edge ai industry could also continue grow still early stage started mostly cloud service provider also see large business q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore okay great deep learning piece part guess really captured lot people imagination including u developer conference coming later month actually last couple seen track track different industry reporting thing deep learning pretty fascinating beginning something like think growth opportunity predict seems like kind growing everywhere obviously put number around guy thinking forecasting business yes really interesting attend gpu developer conference gtc later march bringing together different developer stand 700,000 developer worldwide giving opportunity see happening field ai field data center field term accelerated computing ca always see every single opportunity overall putting hand ai researcher platform allows see lot different opportunity gpu really brings u together term conference see different type industry represented see cloud service provider represented well different type enterprise term attendance think data center business u crafting specifically gpu used allowing underlying platform serve mass mass type development allowing ability use ability put term cloud use term oem particularly focus u focused platform focused term software focused term framework necessary ai keeping completely together overall business overall growth really one one different project occurring scope top time move overall tam think still early stage ai probably u decade going future focus keep current initial change see industry enormous every single day framework continue change new development come forth got load engineer software talent focusing improving overall capability ai using overall gpu platform guess note mean maybe could talk little bit emerging competition cloud customer developed least one know developed custom silicon press story second benefit approach somebody running larger homogeneous workload limitation approach term getting broader usage colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore yes mean really kind going back overall strategy strategy really serve mass really allow excite type ai developer access latest tool latest framework without limitation term certain cloud and/or certain framework exactly sure u term direction move keep overall platform synonymous across different gpus together overall cuda development platform used hundred thousand different developer keeping current possible going first scope term overall vision see moving forward sure opportunity possible area people create specific chip specific chip certain cloud certain framework piece hardware necessarily thinking full dynamic software need going necessary ai well may serve well case overall purpose platform overall yes mean seems clear going strong position regardless guess competition focused think obviously intel going multiple product family come back gpu vendor amd participating asic really top mind consideration guy sort focused optimizing nvidia silicon reality exactly seeing much term anything competition one either store term development mode also really looking overall ability serve market overall software need overall development language really challenging lot ai researcher want go mass mass developing stick overall group see see term whether development move meantime busy work considering different change happening environment every day revising sitting still continuing know build product every day yes okay great mentioned inference use sort specialized silicon inference still pretty new like done cloud cpu even intel clear see migrating specialty silicon guess initially intuitive chip good training inference one sensitive different type computing guy made good stride software tensorrt 3 talk customer seems like real opportunity measure inference software seems like lot win sort service type win visible see first deployed externally able see measure progress colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore colette m. kress q joseph lawrence moore sure within data center business correct inferencing past primarily focused term cpu know different characteristic term overall training new data different form precision often necessary term overall inferencing really image per second done overall gpu time seeing right lot benefit seeing term leveraging gpu training lot inferencing going see going forward simplistic type inferencing overall individual device thinking autonomous machine particularly think automotive well
