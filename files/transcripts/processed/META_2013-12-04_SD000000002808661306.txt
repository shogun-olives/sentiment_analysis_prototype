good morning everybody stephen ju internet equity research analyst credit suisse joined stage jason taylor director infrastructure facebook jason lead group manages server budget allocation design hardware performs architecture review curate term infrastructure plan company jason hold phd mit ultrafast laser quantum computing vanderbilt physic electrical engineering math without ado jason take away great thank jason taylor today want talk thing infrastructure give view current infrastructure talk developing technology think could provide eﬃciency win industrywide next two five year get review facebook scale talk eﬃciency talk idea working right called disaggregated rack get new component think interesting 84 monthly active user outside united state data center five region sizable infrastructure also busy infrastructure 1.89 billion user monthly active user 728 million daily active user user upload 350 million photo per day 240 billion photo term activity 4.5 billion like post comment busy 2012 spent 1.24 billion capital expenditure related purchase server networking equipment storage construction data center scale eﬃciency high priority u several year want talk little bit infrastructure three different section one called cluster service cluster backend cluster cluster refers cluster server network cluster think lot network ton bandwidth inside data center always mindful talk rack rack rack computer 8 foot tall 40 server per rack cluster really window world everybody come facebook hit come facebook go cluster cluster support cluster web server translate server 10,000 web server per cluster 144 terabyte cache spread around around 1000 server also ad rack server dedicated serving ad multifeed center news column facebook kind main page facebook work together generate page look like talk server say mean removed component really necessary operation scale vga port usb kind stuff really necessary cleaned looking slide morning realized entirely notice blue lot newsfeed rack going get technical detail really necessary understand propose future rack unit capacity say unit capacity mean 40 server inside rack work together produce service company newsfeed rack lot ram lot cpu entire history last three day activity compact form fit single rack server facebook index recent activity using facebook go facebook pull newsfeed actually happens back end query go web server newsfeed rack friend list friend aggregator receives query contact leaf server say happened jason friend recently get data together rank via ranking algorithm sends top 10 story actually many option rank give top 10 back little bit think life hit facebook hit single request facebook drawn time going request start web server contact mem cache talk caching server authenticates hit make sure say might hit newsfeed server newsfeed server return bunch id id correspond story content want show user content actually kept caching tier pulled maybe might hit database stuff stuff cache grab ad ship page simplified version actually happens fact actually shipping page along actually ship page eight stage browser start working rendering parallel page generation facebook made five standard server numbered 1 5 one focus single major service facebook web server lot cpu need lot cpu generate website database server everything iop use ﬂash hadoop us lot cpu lot drive photo lowest dollar per gig store lot photo lot optimization work feed newsfeed service talked us lot cpu lot ram copious amount new project service facebook want server anything want long one five server fact capacity engineering team say really conform one standard server get get volume pricing huge operating scale also get repurposing 10 service forecast uncertainty forecast able take unused server one service reallocate another huge eﬃciency win different kind server service repurposing would possible would always dealing worse case forecast surprising win kind analogous guess managing mutual fund thing thing across board well also get easier operation facility facility might ratio 450 server 1 technician server able attain ratio server easy maintain easy operate drawback five major server major service 35 service need conform standard might fit quite perfectly also 200 minor service important facebook thing happens need service change time talk idea fix term eﬃciency data center extremely eﬃcient managing heat facility every watt power server consumes going burn another watt nice optimization get 0.5 watt wastage facebook called pue 1.07 sorry pue 1.07 ratio total power consumed street divided total power consumed server mean every watt power consume burning another 7 cooling essentially eliminating talked project lot really huge eﬃciency win u term server design help also help really running good supply chain lot volume predictable purchase really get lot cost server probably largest eﬃciency win facebook come software tremendous software eﬃciency effort one would highlight would hhvm hphp talked lot core piece software replaces apache php infrastructure go back use apache php common would buy four time many web server today buy web server anything massive eﬃciency win u source talk lot software eﬃciency huge facebook term next opportunity going talk idea called disaggregated rack get new component think could interesting think rack newsfeed server yes 40 server identical think actually putting online 80 processor compute 6 terabyte ram 80 terabyte storage 30 terabyte ﬂash application life rack equipment single server think think take component think stack different way put online rack different way provide really nice eﬃciency win think building block compute really standard server ram ram sled server lot ram storage sled one noc server 15 drive replace fast expander small server back ﬂash ﬂash appliance ﬂash sled rather individual pcie ﬂashcards three win disaggregated rack server/service fit five server really want able fit server really want able provide exact right resource talk little bit server/service fit time longer useful life server/service fit left type 6 server type 6 server provides much cpu much ram dotted line server provides much ram much cpu consumption arrow design type 6 server multifeed newsfeed fit perfectly exact right amount ram exact right amount cpu give another service say search search need much cpu actually ram hungry actually need half much cpu service provides differentiate skew give different type server start problem volume start problem repurposing effectively wasted cpu resource worst thing world area waste thing happen server service need could change time beginning might need might perfect fit year two might need ram cpu fine need ram well company face problem one thing job run one bottleneck buy whole thing bought 40 server need twice much ram going buy another 40 server facebook 2000 server need twice much ram buying another 2000 server able able grow ram independently cpu could important thing get disaggregated rack longer useful life everybody everywhere get rid computer thing need longer fitting enough cpu enough ram enough ﬂash around disk space general people refresh server every three year disaggregated rack one resource think keep compute like three six year ram go bad ram state device last forever could five year disk sled easily four five year ﬂash sled could easily six year even 10 kind crazy ﬂash last think disaggregated rack graph search rather 40 identical server could mix building block many compute unit couple maybe one ﬂash sled couple ram sled storage sled big thing different later graph search cpu win right eﬃcient cpu mean handle traﬃc amount ﬂash ram well eﬃcient want add ﬂash add ram get traﬃc going server way add another ﬂash sled word look direction point particular service need twice much ﬂash far add another sled ﬂash double amount ﬂash paid incremental cost ﬂash opposed buy whole separate rack adding component strength disaggregated rack maintain volume pricing serviceability able custom configuration better fit service specifically also also add hardware easily time smarter technology refreshes also help speed innovation got build new component support new thing whatever new greatness build one thing slam rack older established skus potential issue physical change required data center technician going little bit work okay hire guy interface overhead approximate win estimate say opex really mean depreciation power conservative assumption show 12 20 opex saving aggressive assumption 14 30 opex reasonable saving kind approach disaggregating component something course pretty much anybody industry really requires able software adjust different model compute really talking last 20 year upper corner large tower case hold 386 computer 1992 bottom amir michael holding facebook server 2012 architecturally nothing changed 386 serving today still computer processor assumes ram local drive local peripheral still pcie bus ram bus pretty much architecturally server install data center different desktop 20 year ago lot innovation huge math coprocessor great turn dedicated chip math much faster general processor smp allowed two processor per server two processor better one amortize rest server cost two processor twice much compute multicore processor key scaling moore law gpu’s vector math well ﬂash memory recent game changer fundamentally though thing processor running assuming everything local exponential improvement cpu ram disk nic amazing progress still operating model one idea one thing hoping accomplish disaggregated rack idea like break model think server data center unit compute rack long time different mainframe computer repeat technology go cycle big thing changed network bandwidth amazingly high whenever lot network bandwidth whenever really high backplane disaggregate component happens time nic server completely conceivable go 25 40 even 100 gigabit next year network problem mean kind approach perfectly reasonable talking component also see way component evolve cpu server cpu really version desktop processor desktop world consumes lot lot processor might processor double core got server processor right got nice volume desktop world server kind hanging one thing popular idea mobile world embedded processor idea build server build notice cpu pch nic component always buy together build server fundamentally standard ic chip popular idea gaining traction building processor build regular processor leave little bit silicon license nic design license pch essentially put processor buying three component time buy one component win simplifies rest computer building motherboard building pretty much modern server might board even board lot complexity well pull lot component single chip becomes much simpler design simpler mean higher yield mean much cheaper pulling thing together stuff buy anyway time onto design really nice one really soc processor developed server derived either mobile desktop market power cost eﬃcient really nice win lot people see expect popular next year term ram something called ddr standard ddr standard talk ram designed ddr allowed commoditization ram multiple vendor hitting single standard ddr standard diﬃcult hit diﬃcult build completely different kind memory hit performance standard ram kind space computer right either standard ram built capacitor consumes lot power nothing want something interesting put pcie bus see pcie ﬂashcards think space lot interesting opportunity separate class ram expect memory technology idea standard ram far ram far ram could slower ram like stuff going work frequently stuff need time put regular ram stuff need every hour every 15 minute put slower stuff spend money fast stuff spend le money slower stuff everybody win really nice analogy using ﬂash data center use ﬂash kind ram substitute large data set need keep ca keep ram ram really pretty expensive flash dense power eﬃcient cheaper put lot data ﬂash keep recently accessed stuff ram extended regular computer ﬂash ssd drive commonly used database application need storage ﬂash industry focused driving higher higher write endurance performance going better better ﬂashcards better better ﬂash device actually think looking opposite direction towards ﬂash low write endurance ﬂash low iop performance opposite computer normally bigger better faster want go way think cold ﬂash storage option possible stephen juso workload see workload think pretty much everyone see something want write read want write read time update u photo somebody uploads photo want keep photo forever want change editing photo even people would fact read memory ﬂash alternative technology could provide extremely storage reasonable cost run basic number look rack knox drive system use cold storage archival storage 2 terabyte data rack draw 1.5 kilowatt power many drive spun consuming power weighs 2500 pound consumes 0.8 watt per terabyte compare rack ssd drive done nothing special put ton laptop drive rack actually build paper get 4 petabyte data draw 1.9 kilowatt power without optimization weighs little bit le consumes half much watt per terabyte power density rack drive cold storage almost 2 time option built currently available laptop drive optimization yet buy stuff street think focused effort worm option could yield much higher density longer hardware lifetime reasonable cost massive data growth today industry produce 3 zettabyte hard drive going 20 zettabyte hard drive 2020 large portion data going stored drive really write quite frankly probably write read never let imagine read worm could fine really think permanent storage could interesting thank question answer jason probably time one short question mean bring notion cold ﬂash mean materially different versus technology already widely available jason taylor stephen ju jason taylor sure say asked cold ﬂash materially different current ﬂash everybody think ﬂash today think based ﬂash ﬂash great latest incarnation ﬂash fact eprom eeprom long designed completely different silicon saying design device silicon focused data storage mutable change get much higher bit density low power alternative approach whole silicon looked look possible feel like could probably get market next three five year think actually time thanks much jason thank
