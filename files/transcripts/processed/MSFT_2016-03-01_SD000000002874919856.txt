believe secular trend going business see going cloud see product story really like trying figure whether spending environment sustaining inaudible execute want take advantage purview sort biggest company seeing seeing term budget overall people willing spend software key technology ph software keith wei amy hoodjust high level macro would say talked little bit earnings call seems like long time ago always china brazil russia japan particular u continue look way look continues diﬃcult execute various reason slightly different rest world actually look q2 like expected mean terrific bad mean expected think seen much change would say term spending environment two thing tend focus mostly focusing control super clear know everybody want ask macro frankly matter good bad day talk salesforce well management team focusing execution lot share taken u key believer product cycle got lot strong value prop feel good positioning field remains focused selling great value opposed oil price ca help versus selling deeply hopeful good spot secondly think cycle interesting think lot buzzword digital transformation heart would say enter world maybe already partially deeply cycle opex cog spend many company historically based even overall spend overall budget many many company many many industry grow amount world need spend modernize system take advantage tech exists world quite high pace see value return every company world becoming digital company certainly high way business sourcing technology changing lot well microsoft come equation think fully azure really kind change dynamic going deliver compute storage service top think one key question investor trying figure within intelligent cloud intelligent cloud inaudible think amazing growth seeing azure 140 growth recent quarter going additive overall equation going come point expense inaudible would sold window server premise shifting becoming azure revenue additive equation think people funny get asked question term cog growth growth company deeply focus basically overall growth want incent cloud selling course time u going pace customer want go whether story new data ph keith wei amy hoodthe cloud intelligent cloud segment focus growing double digit certainly across board type number right growth growth cloud lot new scenario talked term spending macro question asked deeply applicable question well simply scenario possible possible azure amongst solution certainly additive long term assume course could every bit compute done eﬃciently cloud assumption course could say yes business go away long curve customer different time period also solution lot cloud attribute whether people server auto backup look little bit like edge cloud think traditional line people thought especially u think little different think okay tend focus top say overall opportunity growing value prop good take share think pretty confident ability grow overall rate talk talking azure talking changing way microsoft delivers service overall intelligent cloud growing one thing mentioned wanted dig little bit something really excited microsoft story hybrid cloud talk particularly executive larger organization definitely either/or private public cloud hybrid talking competitive environment cloud term vendor inaudible service google player people see really part marketplace think microsoft real competitive advantage talking hybrid cloud one three vendor significant technology side house microsoft look leverage look leverage done make hybrid cloud reality customer think really start often time get asked really born cloud overcome one great thing actually large thoughtful enterprise business already made decision long time frankly begin push cloud great coverage globally seller infrastructure talented technical leader go account help journey lot investment front many many year frankly customer already trust hindrance situation helping customer make transition thoughtful way keith wei amy hood keith wei amy hoodand think excited value prop talked one always use think next release sql many attribute think point many people say journey like say terrific interim step start thinking value hybrid cloud going run run might run thing cloud might move workload cloud may able manage secure environment something relatively confident value prop ultimately well like people forget terrific salesforce large capable seen able frankly grow revenue substantially commercial business without adding lot cost structure think really proud think give u good structural advantage continue push new innovation whether cloud hybrid model globally another differentiation inaudible actually software service component well stuff like dynamic crm online also biggest inaudible franchise term oﬃce 365 wanted drill oﬃce 365 little bit inaudible oﬃce 365 stabilization oﬃce franchise whereas three four year ago think people saw much bigger threat stuff like google given online status oﬃce 365 strong offering inaudible ph lot competitive threat ph google get online productivity suite microsoft really gone become real growth opportunity guy talk u one able expand base oﬃce 365 two able improve monetization base upsell path ph come oﬃce 365 sure think important first love question always like thought sucked better trying hard understand basically upgrade ph yes understand construct would say generally growing covered growing installed base across oﬃce exchange sharepoint call lync skype business couple year keith wei amy hoodnow adding continuing expand tend think protecting base growing base time happening small business layer also adding seat inside enterprise solution applicable able create skus expand coverage model need remember even lower arpu arpu seat zero think able expand even lower arpu new seat net new revenue growth u think important concept matter workload across think broad oﬃce franchise pointed think life want increase queue increase pay right able increase quantity seat also time want increase arpu arpu growth seen cloud side increasing mix call e3 sku think fully featured sku including oﬃce workload across comms messaging security etc good news excited e5 newer workload mentioned opportunity actually tend land thing think intelligent cloud mobility solution em security management business term margin analytics suite whether power bi analytics tool margin e5 security feature e5 finally voip e5 really new market u term opportunity language p time q tend use lot would raise arpu many seat talked early put price list december 1 excited pipeline continues build arpu kind build time continue see sale cycle come fruition week outside morgan stanley conference also rsa conference going san francisco obviously lot focus security seems like microsoft increasing focus security whether security functionality e5 suite reading wall street journal guy set new security center manage security thinking microsoft security thinking term need term almost like marketing spend term people confidence product security market opportunity microsoft inaudible selling individual product increasing monetization behind ph heart question really asking think security standalone vertical think deeply horizontally think way generally think way see product horizontal vertical mean you’re selling motion vertically keith wei amy hood keith weissminded term value proposition directly customer give example window 10 especially enterprise value prop one strongest pillar term customer adoption early success seen absolutely security pillar say way buy window 10 security business window 10 deployment enterprise often time secure operating system think probably good example distinction understand nature question certainly opportunity people ask best secure business go solution whether window 10 deployment em solution edp course kind go list solution would look little like buy slightly higher end sku oﬃce 365 make sure highest security protocol buy window 10 enterprise top pro license math equation look like higher arpu tends horizontal broad approach opposed selling security solution major motion got shifting window 10 enterprise side equation security side equation inaudible term dod adopting window 10 relatively fast fashion tend think operating system adoption taking place extended period time many inaudible enterprise adoption actually seeing broadly accelerated pace adoption window enterprise across enterprise ph security functionality know could tell precisely sole root cause think security reasonable assumption based correlation feedback get enterprise deployment motion includes proof concept tend deploy ph standard protocol motion 140 ahead window 7 time people think successful enterprise rollout plan feel good progress still early excited field focused feel like customer lot pull customer well proof understand value prop inaudible think certainly encouraged pace side especially think window 7 pretty healthy benchmark got first side equation term consumer pc market consumer pc market still look pretty weak unit growing look like q1 could another diﬃcult quarter guy think term window 10 cycle think definitely investor expectation window 10 new better operating system help spur marketplace amy hood keith wei amy hooddisappointing still consumer pc growth really early come back made decision provide free upgrade place free upgrade place 200 million active device upgraded mean impact course want window 10 buy new pc motion cycle made active choice motion people frankly become fan window 10 window 8 way build fan exposure think active decision probably impact pc market time think people running window 10 feedback excitement developer excitement choice made term upgrade path term pc market think expectation pc market would much different market generally pretty aligned term expectation seen arpu increase h1 especially consumer side pricing change made certainly higher rpl heard vendor talk shift premium device consumer segment well think person would say help arpus term overall revenue one interesting dynamic come alternative way monetizing window 10 think discreet one inaudible term inaudible search going bing window 10 device well ahead seeing previous device tell u durable think trend term bing avenue monetization thinking new operating system help get yes think often get asked bing search business proud progress business profitable marginal improvement good ability grow team frankly suffered many negative note others psyche long time incredibly proud progress made important strategic business u people underappreciate search business really term competency skill set really core many people think digital agent strategy also cortana cortana analytics product enterprise product came much technology bing team beyond actual search growth feel good search growth driven choice talked window side upgrade base keith wei amy hoodupgrading base including new browser edge performs better ie edge strategy encourage search difference pleased rpfs feel good ability sustain active device number grows term profitability frankly share second one would think gaming business talked lot bringing gaming pc outside search pc gaming one interesting buy pc people spend directly indirectly search certainly one gaming another ability bring incredibly strong brand xbox subscription idea cross console pc whatever device choose whether ar/dr ph well think brand franchise expand truly pc monetization core able make transition effort got last thing inaudible personal computing want make sure touched mobile side equation inaudible lot guy thought mobile potential achilles heel microsoft saw google apple really taking lot share away taking key user interface mobile phone operating system ﬂipside equation microsoft become lot ubiquitous platform oﬃce available platform cortana available platform mobile mobile interface marketshare phone important today two three year ago guy confident ability maintain connection customer application service despite operating system get asked relative frequency obviously tend focus exactly way talk mission ambition effort mobility experience matter u across screen size whether screen many instance iot construct way largest screen ship surface hub big screen video meeting room situation mobility experience familiar work desktop work phone interface wrist interface large screen feel good relevancy market time split amongst many many many input node say way interactive node even construct opposed construct phone think remains focus remains majority investment mean wo continue shipped 950 950 xl holiday ph said performed well better thought think main focus strategically core experience know love whether dev across platform keith wei amy hoodwe bought xamarin week last kind blend must last week today like monday tuesday important say listen going relevant mobile dev app dev write run anywhere back azure great plan conceptually like mobile experience like want shift gear margin side equation talking microsoft gross margin complex equation mix shift one hand driving force lower margin business margin within segment improving really well area seeing improvement gross margin segment cloud side equation question get often guy trying figure gross margin profile azure particular today heading help answer question investor think framework azure gross margin heading could ultimately think talk lot commercial cloud gross margin think hard people want number confusing get blend two different business different lifecycles understand nature question hard people azure particular made substantial progress past couple year azure gross margin profile look confusion ability continue improve margin see clearly aws get seems mathematically correct trajectory understand understand lifecycle feel good heading azure profile given relative size oﬃce 365 side margin improving well much actually want make sound old big business u already margin improved substantially well gotten point improvement le quote/unquote substantial getting point scale got room improve sure make sure team hear say done good job one well good progress feel confident think talked well oﬃce 365 side cleanly ph also clear think azure business sort ph cash margin profile attribute whether bi analytics different margin profile would say store compute look like store compute feel good trajectory keith wei amy hood keith wei q unidentified participant opex side equation slightly softened question guy done remarkable job keeping opex control really tight focus opex past two year question get durability long opex remain growth low growth microsoft point guy ﬂip switch really start go investment mode actually question two thinking opex growth pacing revenue growth long actually durable think new segment reason gone operating income segment obvious everyone investing versus top line segment incredibly important intelligent cloud segment saw quarter investing operating expense growing top line substantially issue investing salesperson engineering expand tam grow revenue would feel badly said growth business growth profile large ability take share investing business holding people accountable easy decision everywhere else done think good job moving saying differently stop move dollar better higher return whether roi dollar wrong place move certainly lot work done past 2.5 year guess almost 3 job continue still room always room optimize also continuing get eﬃcient every dollar take layer move resource make easier also good choice pretty nuanced answer run business way run want segment dynamic business need run mind pretty focused continuing increase roi every single dollar looking every business see structural improvement path one two excellent bunch question want get want also leave time audience question audience keep going question answer thanks amy two question viewing margin inaudible core business make sure understand correctly within amy hood q unidentified participant amy hoodmpc inaudible 265 ph intelligent cloud incremental growth driven azure right expectation margin right ask mind number one lower margin inaudible traditional time scaled ph time think microsoft company trying invest growth want get ski margin expectation yes segment right oﬃce frankly pbp productivity business process yes probably cleanest one business traditional form 95 plus growth level new business even scale wo get point even know many business life view negative scale saas business high margin business wo 95 right blended rate come absolute dollar growth course quite good intelligent cloud many attribute slightly complicated delta larger sustaining level saas sustaining margin far higher iaa paas sustaining margin point scale margin right high traditional margin lower sustained gross outcome would lower growth pbp certainly level good cash ﬂow/real dollar growth think npc obviously widest discrepancy got hardware business use xbox example traditional razor blade model way oem business opposite end margin spectrum structurally see bigger gap think one thing would say structurally npc segment volatility term ability jump others likely surprised margin curve behind business npc addition large delta sustaining margin time also business core meaning transactional recognized transactional basis volatility revenue line well margin line one understand people diﬃcult get curve sustaining curve attribute rest commercial entity inaudible well seen u invest opex intelligent cloud mostly think seen way segment able reallocate reuse resource moving investment npc intelligent cloud technical diﬃculty keith wei amy hood keith wei amy hood inaudible lot stock inaudible dividend yield close 3 today ton cash cash sitting offshore put together model guy take significant debt fund u operation fund repurchase dividend basis sustainable continue inaudible take debt fund obligation company one remain feel confident could raise money aa+ aa whatever generally tend think decision around total shareholder return thought best investing core obviously principle number one running eﬃciently growing inorganically make sense returning dividend thoughtful yield finally repurchasing share feel proud frankly progress made across front
