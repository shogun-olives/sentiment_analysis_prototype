morning folk wanted talk today cognitive software ai software general specifically ibm watson starting talking attribute cognitive software think software around 20 25 year 30 year around responds essentially set algorithm talking today term cognitive ai software software necessarily need programmed system actually learn seen many discussion people talk deep learning talk machine intelligence talk artificial intelligence general term essentially synonym cognitive software technology technology support slide example handle lot unstructured information handle audio information textual information natural language processing case actually right software generate human readable sentence paragraph natural language generation mentioned machine learning component already system actually learns essentially modifies algorithm time using different type algorithm pattern recognition automated analytics predictive capability part cognitive software technology time lot technology evolve thing like image analytics idea able understand semantics able interpret people actually saying saying want able actually understand create hypothesis prediction really understanding various sens people looking got sensory input processing also emotion recognition well take look ecosystem way idc look component talked previously dialog management apis text analytics speech recognition component component usually put together cognitive ai software platform tool like ibm watson tool wipro holmes tc ignio salesforce einstein platform people actually using develop artificial intelligence application around white circle around content data think one reason include circle application inherently statistically driven based data action prediction recommendation based data fed system important content data feeding system would correct available combination possibly data consideration need go thing important data become integral component cognitive ai solution get little talk ibm strategy actually market data beginning emerge part kind application last least different type application process application cognitively enabled seeing sale seeing finance also seeing industry application around able help healthcare term improving patient outcome able money laundering able come right price particular product seeing service term advertising legal system commercial leasing know application tool like airbnb uber using disrupt industry based kind cognitive ai type solution last least cognitively enabled consumer service product seeing wealth come marketplace everything retail system help pick choose kind coat want wear able help identify best place travel best price kind thing becoming call cognitively enabled look popular used case seeing obviously healthcare manufacturing finance government retail popular used case seeing term idc cognitive spending guide research seeing finance one advanced area people spending money initially seeing healthcare following closely retail right manufacturing government little bit behind think seeing opportunity really entire gamut cognitive application running industry running different used case almost everything think term software going cognitively enabled point probably near future i.e. next 5 10 year term ibm watson asked anurag kind ibm watson well really technology platform definition technology platform us natural language processing machine learning reveal insight large amount unstructured data really get heart talking taking sensory input taking text taking different type data making sense able help augment improve worker decision prediction based data component ibm watson portfolio well first foremost watson developer cloud ibm set 2013 got 100,000 developer hundred partner addition also venture capital fund funding various partner also providing seed money help company innovative idea make use watson developer tool number tool watson developer cloud available via bluemix people get access easily start working one primary area watson developer cloud time area watson explorer really search discovery application includes cognitive ai component able help organization find locate information make use information process ibm also created number watson business unit watson iot looking combining cognitive ai technology iot urgence iot area growing also

digital reasoning ipsoft nuance startup like cognitivescale numenta company acquired intel acquiring saffron technology nervana system company coming consulting company like tata consultancy service infosys wipro wide range competitor marketplace right hand side company actually would considered cognitive software platform today apis service starting make available people everybody lockheed saic getting involved work fujitsu baidu company like google facebook microsoft amazon offer different type cognitive api service would really characterize complete platform point time last least kind

anurag rana david schubmehl anurag rana david schubmehl thank much dave comprehensive overview going make request question feel free ask submitting one area right slide let start question pas jitendra switch back forth dave described cognitive science one generational transformation sector among people talk current level awareness think people aware popular press done tremendous job raising issue think also raised lot misunderstanding think awareness cognitive ai technology coming going able think fairly common today think common whether business organization actually thought going use cognitive ai technology competitive improve roi improve sale think level thinking really yet taken hold dave said mean would advise ceo cio respect early deployment cognitive solution mean start focus cost revenue best practice seen far far early deployment cognitive solution concerned think really interesting mean think seeing company kind every little bit everything company looking reducing cost

seeing lot company starting test water around right time u maybe take customer service augment conversational ai agent ivr system think replacing ivr system conversational ai agent better job also turnover possibility turning customer support call actual sale hey dave conversation technology software company think awareness high everyone brother launching new ai product given day kind awareness company let say somebody manufacturing area metal mining mean idea happening oh yeah think mean look look company like example caterpillar caterpillar developing autonomous driving mining vehicle last several year term able reduce cost thing like john deere combining cognitive ai software data collection point farm implement actually hit ground try improve farmer yield thing like making tractor farm implement actually delivered data used develop predictive model think think lot lot opportunity sort traditional company need think kind data kind data could develop predictive model could develop recommendation system would potentially change business opportunity dave go strategy company ibm mean everybody else pitching ai solution obviously google top hill deepmind acquisition application back differentiation ibm watson think differentiation something last longer longer term given competition ph anurag rana david schubmehl jitendra waralwell mean think look google

standpoint think situation term fact cognitive ai service making available via bluemix great talk like think market size obviously impact seems widespread david schubmehl anurag rana david schubmehlhow size market look much worth guy monetize yeah mean sizing couple different way one part spending guide research looking spend available term software side mean well actually multiple different technology obviously hardware side seeing increase gpus seeing increase compute power coming different folk software side see kind two differentiation one cognitive software platform talked business going grow quickly tool business right opposed cognitively enabled application business really going add ai piece enterprise software going develop new piece software something going cognitively enabled see total technology something like 30 billion business 30 billion opportunity 20 think 2019 right got growth rate something order 50 55 cagr compound annual growth rate type application one thing going caution people also seeing enterprise software company adding ai component standard enterprise software case probably going charge example version sharepoint includes delve technology talked cost regular sharepoint part package going see percentage application actually going embed ai functionality going additional revenue software vendor help sell copy package particular case wo count ai revenue cognitive software revenue count erp revenue crm revenue question answer thanks dave dave question audience first one specific ai company healthcare would highlight ahead curve mean number watson partner people mean really expert healthcare area mean company anurag rana david schubmehl anurag rana david schubmehl jitendra warallike modernizing medicine thought quite innovative based partnership ibm company interesting thing health insight group probably people ask specifically healthcare environment great next question could discus extent watson used fight attack believe announcement ibm watson term cyber security thing yet really particular area really aware watson used really fraud analytics compliance analytics seeing place think also work going ibm watson dod work thing like really aware oﬃcially think safe bet ibm working closely federal government try try analyze understand different type threat great one another one business think business risk obsolete cognitive computer replaces service look list area come first mind well mean think think people need thinking different type technology going changed impacted think fact may cognitive ai
