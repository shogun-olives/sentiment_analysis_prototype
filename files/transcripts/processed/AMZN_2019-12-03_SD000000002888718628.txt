thank hello welcome 8th annual aws invent awesome favorite time year 65,000 peer know aws invent sale marketing conference learning education conference everybody favorite part week breakout session year different 3,000 led partner customer get real scoop platform going need every minute 3 hour scheduled lot including thing good end going get right giddy thinking throwing conference back 2012 spent lot time debating name conference decide like chose intentional reason chose name reﬂected seeing time incredible number large small company alike way inventing pace inventing many large enterprise completely reinventing customer experience aws cloud lynchpin see look million active customer using platform today look happened last six year enterprise dramatically changed view cloud adopted aws cloud every imaginable vertical business segment financial service see capital one goldman sachs barclays hsbc intuit commonwealth bank australia life science health care see merck pfizer squibb johnson johnson novartis astrazeneca manufacturing ge schneider electric siemens philip energy shell bp hess halliburton every imaginable vertical business segment using aws cloud meaningful way also see public sector 7,000 government agency worldwide using aws 10,000 academic institution 25,000 nonprofit broad adoption reason bigger company started moving cloud happened last 12 13 year completely disrupted industry largely standing start top aws often time reel number using platform successful last 13 year built business aws give example think illustrate talking term revolution think old day needed taxi called taxi company dispatcher would sometimes pick sometimes let ring forever sometimes nice phone sometimes rude phone sometimes taxi come said never knew going come get car little bit filthy think experience today completely revolutionized company like lyft uber grab ola careem totally different look accommodation wanted stay somewhere town used always default hotel look airbnb completely changed industry 4 million active listing one time 2 million people night staying rental crazy think exercise used use bicycle exercise yes go ride bicycle felt like dealing element could go spin class get car go go particular time could bicycle home little bit boring exercise think peloton used technology completely change experience every day 20 livestreams 10,000 stream look totally changed way exercise think delivery food old day unless lived new york city thing got delivered pizza company like doordash grubhub postmates get virtually anything delivered believe know son one best customer think disrupted industry around long time really standing start thought choose theme keynote today kept coming back topic question topic talk company think transforming reinvent business customer experience meaningful sustainable long period time transformation mean transforming mean transforming meet new technology situation opportunity transformation question 1 question thought would share think 6 critical component going make significant transformation big change big transformation make want procrastinate get easier wait fact ditch get deeper think type first element big type transformation like turn technical leadership look company make transformation successfully versus talk 4 differentiator first actually need figure get senior team aligned going make change easy make big shift like inertia powerful thing easy block various part organization sometimes intended reason sometimes reason easy block find way senior management conviction alignment going make change find mechanism get issue table know making progress go several month road thinking making progress wo make change need senior level alignment second thing need right alongside need aggressive goal force organization move faster organically otherwise would let give 2 counter example point think several year ago cio ge jamie miller decided thought critical ge move cloud move much quickly got top technical leader together said `` going move 50 application aws next 30 day said 45 minute told dumb idea would never work listened patiently said `` hear going let go got 42 application 30 day along way figured security model governance model compliance model success built momentum sudden idea started ﬂowing else move 3/4 way moving several thousand application aws second aggressive goal would happened set goal forced company move let give counter example went go see company life science space turned knew cio friend friend never met connection got meeting little bit late coming see u ceo cio came said `` going grab think felt bad friend friend connection said `` infrastructure leader get room tell together said `` well fine much u said `` oh definitely true like know lot heard got kind workload running experimenting kicking tire said `` well using 3 ec2 instance said `` oh ca right infrastructure leader came room said `` john said `` lot aws said `` oh yes ton kicking tire experimenting lot thing going said `` many ec2 instance using said `` like 3 4 said `` mean lot easy go long period time dipping toe water aggressive goal let organization know priority make transformation way cio went away 2 week later set aggressive goal one top 5 life science customer today need aggressive goal third thing got train people lot time conversation around table senior people get excited decide move cloud come back company say `` good news cloud nobody experience using hard use cloud take little bit training train hundred thousand customer every year fourth thing important got make sure allow organization get paralyzed able move figure move every last workload lot customer go portfolio analysis go application classify application easy move medium hard move go last dependency legacy easily lifted shifted rearchitected move cloud build thoughtful methodical multiyear plan migrate company find almost always many workload relatively easily able move cloud get benefit fact inform lot later workload hardest one move got make sure get paralyzed first step transformation technical much leadership making sure senior level alignment aggressive goal force organization move faster otherwise would right training thoughtful methodical multiyear plan make migration find company make decision going make transformation move cloud developer raring go ready go want broadest possible capability want slowed last year talked `` want want year talking `` stop good time want stop decide company going make transformation cloud developer want able move fast possible want constrained want capability need move everything want move build anything imagine want broadest possible capability nobody capability aws 175 service nobody close number service number service depth feature capability within service lot noise lot company become pretty good checkbox hero kind look something rush say `` look depth detail offering pretty different see across major infrastructure component compute storage database analytics machine learning iot robotics messaging content distribution marketplace people service big difference quote see hear lot one happens expedia typically hear customer talk think couple year ahead functionality regard maturity instance container network going spend lot time networking piece part going let surprised press release coming later today also dave brown going reveal lot detail new networking feature networking presentation wednesday say couple thing first compute without great network attached wo find network functionality capability aws look footprint pop ability get backbone much broader footprint find elsewhere also network place direct connect data center aws one 100 gigabit per second standard instance also capable network hub call transit gateway allows connect data center aws also set across multiple aws vpcs different region ability take connection much throughput find anywhere else ability connect branch oﬃces easily aws find elsewhere branch oﬃces integration even multicast ip nobody else launching today much broadly capable network find elsewhere going focus comment compute instance container look instance start meaningfully instance anybody else also got lot powerful capability within instance powerful gpu machine learning trading instance powerful gpu graphic rendering instance largest instance sap workload 24 terabyte fastest processor cloud z1d got standard instance 100 gigabit per second network connectivity instance processor choice intel amd arm base different set capability instance side look pace innovation aws number instance built totally accelerated significant way 4x instance type today two year ago couple reason able innovate much faster rate first spent significant amount time couple year totally rehauling reinventing virtualization hypervisor layer built system call nitro look nitro take virtualization security networking storage main server lightweight hypervisor customer instance give back cpu consuming mean get performance indistinguishable bare metal much lower cost also mean taken piece main server put nitro chip built innovate much quicker fashion every time make change one piece changed lockstep able add network optimized instance instance quickly wo find elsewhere separated piece separable bunch third thing security capability nitro also think meaningfully better traditional hypervisors trusted domain people often call dom0 thing like able add vms agent troubleshooting limited number people provider allow access trusted domain got customer instance careful lock et cetera nitro moved security main server separable nitro chip mean lock main server customer instance one access worry control accessible much better security posture first thing totally overhauled reinvented virtualization layer something called nitro helped u innovate much faster rate see throughout conversation second thing decided going design build chip think history aws big turning point u acquired annapurna lab group talented expert chip designer builder israel decided going actually design build chip try give capability think lot company including working x86 processor long time intel close partner increasingly started using amd well wanted push price performance envelope meant innovating took annapurna team set loose couple chip wanted build thought could provide meaningful differentiation term performance thing really mattered thought people really broad way first chip started working chip called graviton chip announced last year part a1 instance first instance cloud designed used workload containerized microservices web tier apps thing like 3 question wondering launched a1 instance first anybody use second partner ecosystem step support tool chain required people use instance third innovate enough first version graviton chip allow use chip much broader array workload first 2 question really pleasantly surprised see slide number logo load customer using a1 instance way anticipated partner ecosystem really stepped supported instance significant way third question whether could really innovate enough chip sure part reason started working couple year ago second version graviton even building first version know going able might take excited announce today launch new set instance m6g r6g c6g instance ec2 new generation instance powered aws graviton 2 pretty exciting provide pretty significant difference first version graviton chip customized core silicon instance 64 vcpus 25 gigabit per second enhanced networking 18 gigabit per second eb bandwidth versus first graviton chip 4x compute core 5x faster memory overall 7x better performance first graviton chip arguably importantly 40 better price performance latest generation x86 processor unbelievable think excited give today m6g available today r6g c6g available early 2020 also simultaneously split piece annapurna team build second chip trying pick thing could totally change game regard use started graviton 2 chip 40 better price performance get latest generation x86 run virtually workload huge game changer also started working something thought would also game changer really around machine learning talked lot group year training machine learning get lot attention hefty load instance perform best powerful machine learning trading p3 p3d instance lot machine learning scale production like lot inside room done know majority cost actually prediction inference think example take alexa example train model couple time week big old model think many device everywhere making inference prediction every minute 90 80 90 cost actually prediction want try work problem everybody talking training nobody actually working optimizing largest cost machine learning announced last year keynote working inference optimized chip called inferentia excited announce today launch inf1 instance ec2 backed new inferentia chip inf1 instance lot thing excited low latency 3x higher throughput think 3x faster throughput 40 le cost current best inference instance video chip significant innovation team 2,000 tera operation per second integrated major framework tensorflow mxnet pytorch available today ec2 make available sagemaker ec eks early 2020 think instance addition number instance powerful instance within category capability nitro innovate much faster clip layer top desire willingness design build chip give capability instance space unlike find anywhere else instance let talk container second increasingly customer using container kind workload advent microservices architecture also make quicker faster people deploy another area think container lot capability lot resonance elsewhere look container cloud 81 run aws significant part lot capability provider effectively 1 container service managed kubernetes service 3 started building container service back 2014 really popular orchestration engine customer said u `` want container want container deeply integrated rest aws platform capability built something called elastic container service ec grown unbelievably fast continues weed lot customer like verizon gopro fox mcdonald duolingo use control development ec lot help lot input thank much keep coming please control development ec mean launch new feature integrate ec right customer want deeply integrated container service choose ec surprisingly kubernetes became popular lot customer wanted u something look today 84 kubernetes run cloud run top aws lot kubernetes customer understandably wanted managed service built elastic kubernetes service eks grown like weed well since launched couple year ago really really fast customer say `` well awesome choice 2 managed container service ec eks would prefer worry server cluster want manage container task level built something launched couple year ago called aws fargate fargate serverless container offering offering like anywhere tell u cpu memory want upload container image fargate rest deploys rightsizes compute server cluster provisioning look popularity fargate kind blow u away thought people would interested think anticipated broadly demanded new customer year new container customer aws 40 start fargate much easier run container way launched fargate support ec since control development ec coordinate anybody much easier trying make work kubernetes easy customer understandably use kubernetes said `` well love idea fargate wo make work kubernetes excited change right launch amazon fargate amazon eks kubernetes customer able get serverless benefit running container aws mean 4 container offering choose like manage server cluster level want ﬂexibility stitch thing together use either ec eks want operate task level worry server cluster use fargate either ec eks exciting make decision going transform going move cloud get senior level alignment set aggressive goal force org move developer want go want held back want platform capability fraction capability capability especially pay upfront look across platform bar people want look compute want number instance powerful machine learning training instance powerful machine learning inference instance powerful gpu rendering instance biggest instance sap workload 100 gigabit per second connectivity standard instance access different processor option want one container want multiple container managed level well serverless level want network capability functionality david michael solomonbroadest footprint best performance capability thing like transit gateway make much easier set global network bar people want compute one give aws make way much easier move existing workload also allow developer build anything imagine right tool right price quickly possible may noticed walking dj playing music often keynote year 2 dj woman dj male dj last 15 minute going actually bring stage male dj whose dj name dj actually going come talk music although actually interesting thing say music enjoyed selection tape turn dj ceo goldman sachs true yes yes awfully good addition ceo going ask david solomon come stage share transformation goldman sachs making using aws cloud david thank andy thank good morning everybody one thing tell sure fun today 15 minute 7:45 8:00 a.m really happy standing looking world best technologist one biggest technology conference year know wondering head bank well world changing saw ceo goldman sachs dj la vega first time would say let tell little bit using cloud technology change business goldman sachs financial service company provide advice lend invest money make market manage risk stand middle market trillion dollar ﬂows advise hundred transaction year underwrite million stock bond offering ultimately help client achieve financial goal care deeply client goal intangible abstract thing problem everything simple lending complex derivative trading serf real purpose like helping renovate kitchen finance expanding contracting business finance simple reality finance much complex goldman sachs job try simplify make easy intuitive effective possible around 9,000 engineer make 1/4 workforce best engineer world working interesting problem everything building trying make finance work better cloud technology allows u job way simple accounting complexity industry helping u ensure work safe secure responsible work cloud provider aws first immense capability astounding pace innovation year ago colleague roy joseph stage talk work together develop bring key solution aws key management service crucial data privacy development allowed u fully organization embrace cloud nose aws approach technology really unlocked something u since busy help aws building predominantly based business want talk couple minute today first credit card business conversation client realized credit card could much simpler thing could provide consumer new way relate spending repositioning credit card tool truly side building credit card platform underpins apple card took number engineer long along strong partnership apple mastercard course aws would made sense u get business maintain field field data center reason able deliver capability digitally scale cloud technology apple card launched month ago already one successful credit card launch ever part marcus digital consumer banking business today three year old although company still new consumer finance think pretty clear something today marcus 55 billion retail deposit million client putting cloud technology work area business well big company make trillion dollar payment every day right space dominated legacy architecture manual process slow turnaround time next year launch transaction banking service digital platform help corporation manage cash built entirely stack provided aws goldman sachs already using make billion dollar payment 5 currency every day providing u enhanced transparency tracking around cash ﬂows saving u lot time money process eager client experience service look forward sharing detail rollout plan next year 2020 historically financial technology powerful fast lagged behind consumer term elegance simplicity want bank account wait fund clear want loan wait approval would want advice company better manage balance sheet send ask meeting way better yet finance perfect place take new technology immediate world impact data scientist using ai machine learning technique year already pushing research community consider andrew r. jassywhat possible apply quantum power quantum computing power financial problem well goldman sachs corporation government institution individual also building developer way go aws cloud service want first choice provide service enable build financial functionality directly application workﬂows already institutional client making capability powerful security database available directly platform called goldman sachs marquee real power goldman sachs marquee lie scalable service access directly apis published apis developer.gs.com continue add time client already use power aws access number service migrating production marquee aws starting next year delivering new product service client directly goal goldman sachs lead way building financial service technology going succeed small part work done continue amazon web service still job remain assume burden complexity make finance easy intuitive effective possible want enable focus building thing could dream thing change way world work better sure finance complex never drag innovation like aws goldman sachs finance ever business accelerant look forward seeing build together thank much great day thanks david really honor u partnering goldman sachs really excited together thank partnership making transformation make decision going make big move give developer access tool let make change quickly ﬂexibly another thing got think got think thing going take thing going leave behind making big move people often call modernization question company asking infrastructure many year compare cloud cost capital expensive variable basis get elasticity near capability cloud launching 2,500 new service feature year spend scarce resource engineer thing undifferentiated heavy lifting security posture objectively look whether want toil away refining infrastructure next several year company saying `` thanks moving moving make decision going modernize make lot decision decide going bring little bit like moving home look mainframe also look like audit notice licensing change pricing increase well going move decide going actually take going leave behind turn company making big transformation see bet reconsider everything thought would share biggest decision trend see modernization company making big transformation first thing company trying move away mainframe quickly every industry lot company mainframe people want move away expensive slow complicated hardly anybody mainframe skill anymore fact one story like one enterprise customer making big shift moving mainframe teasing apart moving aws got last step needed find credential decompile something could find anybody company credential realize 1 person woman retired 10 year ago moved state name ginger able find gave credential made last step ca always find ginger people want using mainframe long term lot customer moving away see couple different pattern see company basically tease whole thing apart microservices relaunch aws western union company methodically picking certain workload moving one one away mainframe mainframe becomes le central kind life place nonessential task company like vanguard allianz u.s. air force make mistake company trying move quickly away mainframe lot success second thing see people move modernize older guard relational database talked keynote year people trying move away oracle sql server expensive proprietary high amount licensing term downright punitive think meet customer looking ﬂee oracle one thing seen last couple year change people trying get away sql server pretty quickly well one reason see return way old microsoft prioritizing matter guy customer let give example many year able take sql server license bought bring license run want relational database service example one day microsoft decided want let good hell good microsoft maybe think think people sick tired pawn game moving fast open engine like mysql postgres mariadb get performance need open engine compare well database hard take lot work lot amazon doable hard asked u try solve issue give database option work open engine comparable performance database built amazon aurora launched 2015 aurora version completely compatible postgres mysql several time faster performance typical implementation community edition least durable performant available database 1/10 cost growing service history aws since inception 2015 got ten thousand customer using moving broad list like squibb fannie mae electronic art astrazeneca liberty mutual nasdaq hulu verizon finra broad group pretty amazing u fast people moving aurora pace mainframe relational database third area see lot modernization decision around moving window linux happening several year anyway idc estimate 2020 80 workload deployed linux workload linux grown 4x faster window reason first people want pay tax anymore window particularly know price go frequently second turn vibrant community around linux vibrant community around anywhere else feature security thing happen much quicker third people keen one owner operating system especially prone raise price happens lot change licensing term look window cloud 57 window cloud run aws company owns operating system maybe crazy decide change licensing rule said `` hi new version window run dedicated instance cloud provider trying stranglehold workload back platform think customer keen one company operating system building business continue see people moving window linux fourth area modernization see around partner choose look isvs saas provider adapt technology infrastructure platform work technology infrastructure platform doubt software work technology infrastructure platform 2 3 start aws significant market segment leadership position see much vibrant collection isvs saas provider aws moving cloud want capability see salesforce run vast majority top aws workday splunk informatica infor acquia datadog databricks much broader collection software moving cloud use really easily top platform interesting thing see company moving cloud often different system integrator used last number year lot fact company making big change want work si really deep cloud platform lot dedicated trained professional platform think lot large si dilemma big business outsourcing build practice hedge bet across lot different company actually get deeper one platform company taking risk moving get little bit nervous big si think made shift pretty well done successfully company like deloitte accenture see lot heavy lifting moving enterprise cloud done si either pivoted model quicker realized future company like slalom rackspace born cloud si worry cannibalizing existing business happy pick small pilot project pay much seem like worth everybody know ca move unless get pilot done successfully willing bet future company like onica clearscale u.s. cloudreach u.k. allcloud europe versent asia pacific lot heavy lifting lot different choice partner people moving cloud well think transformation transformation deciding going make move energizing company make move equipping developer broadest possible capability make move quickly successfully eﬃciently making hard decision going take new era versus going leave behind also transformation really meeting new environment new technical challenge think look age respect much data trying store process analyze like nothing ever seen different era existed past world storing mostly gigabyte data sometimes terabyte world consuming petabyte data sometimes exabyte lot reason borderless internet application reach everywhere much broader way possible lot cloud much accessible compute storage much faster get work done company thrive new era much data using old tool used forever adapting meet new technology challenge tool required one challenge find company data accumulated long period time unfortunately live data silo place make analytics machine learning painful expensive slow company excited able build data lake bring data together make analytics machine learning much easier look people building data lake top nothing come close approaching many data lake built amazon s3 object store reason people choosing s3 data lake base first turn reliable scalable available anything else lot architecture take data store multiple data center typically 3 data center mile apart 100 right low latency operate application compare provider either mostly region one data center capability az live building right next door problem building street end availability durability story different availability scalability second s3 secure data storage lot example give talk era giant data like really want granularity actual object level s3 object store allows block public access bucket account level object store give inventory report object answer question like `` object encrypted object store allows analyze access permission object bucket feature launched yesterday called iam access analyzer available secure also object store data lake give way get data turn matter lot data coming everywhere get wire get direct connect backbone streaming iot storage gateway sftp want snowball appliance even container snowmobile almost every magical way imagine getting data wherever data lake s3 significantly way find elsewhere thing aws actually give ability automate action think era large data matter look s3 storage class unlike anything find anywhere else ass using machine algorithm object hot le frequently accessed move warmer colder storage adjust price accordingly operating hundred petabyte information sometimes exabyte customer want take operation across every single one object want something like s3 batch operation let take action across object something wo find elsewhere s3 lowest cost option s3 glacier deep archive wo find anything cost effective cheaper tape way thing find s3 wo find capability elsewhere many people choosing s3 data lake think world data lake lot customer large data lake actually pretty challenging application place setting data data aggregated normalized indexed reformatted application trying access data lake lot people person job decide application access data complicated stressful capability identity access management iam give kind ﬂexibility customer used ﬂexibility different access policy object configure need people often make mistake customer asked u would help find way simplify especially age large data excited announce launch today amazon s3 access point radically simplifies managing access scale application using shared data lake service access point give customized path bucket unique host name access policy enforces specific permission set ﬂexible also access point lock access vpc access lock network think deciding access data amount data make much easier layer thousand top one bucket assign different access policy application scale much better going make way fewer mistake much much easier unique helpful feature building broad data lake company moving data lake tried couple year continue try make easier easier manage data lake s3 access point example lake formation announced last year keynote make much faster build data lake scratch another example thing end day right analytic service matter want broadest capability analytics space aws provided last number year nobody selection analytics service turn want ad hoc query unstructured data use athena want process vast amount unstructured data using dynamic cluster distributed framework like spark hadoop presto pig hive yarn use emr want superfast query structured data like data warehouse use redshift want analytics streaming data use kinesis want bi beautiful visualization great embedded ml capability like wo find elsewhere use quicksight broad array analytics service want go back redshift launched redshift 2012 really changed data warehousing space first data warehouse built ground cloud really changed pricing equation le 1,000 per terabyte service aws first three year aurora launched continued service u ten thousand customer using redshift broadly used data warehouse cloud company like electronic art aetna mcdonald yelp dow jones pfizer intuit liberty mutual customer gravitating redshift significant part continuing iterate fast clip look last year alone redshift team added 100 feature wo share touch think really mattered customer first concurrency scaling launched year ago automatically add remove capacity based unpredictable demand incredible many redshift customer already using concurrency scaling give hour day free usage concurrency scaling 97 using using free second day ago released materialized view take frequent query precomputes cache aggregation filter even join table make query go much faster people pretty excited third thing working year 2 something called spectrum refer lake house really able query data stored locally node redshift also across data lake s3 surprisingly people start querying across redshift s3 also want able query across operational database lot important data set live today released something called federated query let query across redshift s3 relational database service including aurora postgres querying across data store getting aggregated data set redshift customer want move data set back data lake want let analytics service machine learning service able use well actually turn diﬃcult pain butt actually kind work made easy new query called data lake export releasing today well redshift redshift continuing iterate fast clip based lot telling u matter step back look redshift broadly used data warehouse cloud 2x faster anything else fudge benchmark 75 le expensive anything yet would argue look age data today fast forward even couple year exponentially amount data people storing trying process analyze going increase looking around corner adjusting evolving allow want thought lot space one first thing told u `` hi look really want able scale storage compute separately redshift redshift instance storage compute contain turn workload need storage provision instance even need compute want scale separately seems like pretty reasonable request excited share way allow scale storage compute separately new redshift ra3 instance managed storage ra3 instance fast big ssds local instance turn workload exceeds ssds amount storage ssds local instance built technology intelligently automatically move le frequently accessed data s3 nitro like talking earlier built unique instance fast bandwidth actually need data s3 query move much faster leave without bandwidth instance ra3s get separate storage compute turn way local ssds using ssd local ssd pay use pretty significant enhancement customer using redshift time think prevailing way people thinking separating storage compute letting people scale separately way well going compute move storage bunch awaiting compute node issue got think first think much data going scale fast forward year think much data going actually move network get compute networking capacity multiple petabit per availability zone 100 gigabit per second instance large scalable network hard look around corner realize going saturate network point going slow performance going real bottleneck could get networking bottleneck sure let imagine maybe could got second problem look hardware trend notice throughput ssds node ssds scaling growing 6x faster rate ability cpu process data memory mean even get networking bottleneck cpu wo able keep storage mean going performance problem unless decide provision compute adding cost separating storage compute led u really think need evolve allow better performance world moving team spent better part year 2 thinking excited announce aqua advanced query accelerator redshift innovative way cache let build let 10x better query performance cloud data warehouse solution aqua first totally ﬂips equation moving storage compute head moving compute storage built aqua big cache architecture top s3 cache scale parallel lot different node node processor make thing go much faster taken nitro chip adapted innovated top allow speed compression encryption make processing much faster actually compute raw data without move also save lot work past work actually build data movement pipeline precompute thing movement data storage compute lot muck aqua get double benefit much faster able compute raw storage saving time energy muck moving data also give 10x better query performance find anywhere else work existing redshift implementation going work make migration simple easy available really excited think also pretty good example something see time build something new new period time build something shiny shiny something shinier great product great company find way carefully listen customer relentlessly keep innovating behalf seen redshift space compute storage database analytics machine learning aws first 13 year expect continue think scale data way changing redshift allow manage even looking forward year redshift analytics service think also think area like elasticsearch many use elasticsearch room managed elasticsearch service launched year ago growing like weed incredible much people using service ten thousand customer large customer like nike intuit airbnb hulu pinterest customer think use elasticsearch amount data changing want also realize challenge explosion data many people building microservices amount log data people want use monitor ass operational performance gigantic one extra challenge elasticsearch file format optimized search storage size relatively ineﬃcient number customer want actually store month operational data many hundred terabyte data happens expensive enough customer customer storing day maybe week worth operational data elasticsearch want lot reason want analyze operational data log data longer period time something thought tried figure could build solution work excited announce launch ultrawarm new warm tier really steroid amazon elasticsearch service typical warm storage layer elasticsearch service used pervasively performance pretty laggy durability good taken different approach built ultrawarm designed warm tier steroid much better durability backed s3 several thing ultrawarm little bit different first look sophisticated technology advanced placement technique look block data block data frequently accessed frequently accessed one frequently accessed move s3 save money way think ultrawarm use right save 90 storage cost versus elasticsearch today 80 le expense warm tier find elasticsearch service cloud leveraging nitro unique instance built fast bandwidth allow turn need make query pull data s3 high bandwidth instance make much faster get snappy interactive performance need expect use elasticsearch excited providing today easy sign preview start today excited take chance think amount data changing use changing think data lake changing think access policy give lot people access data lake changing analytics service using changing price performance going expect need able process amount data want analytics service also impacting database database immune issue type challenge talked analytics couple decade lot company primarily use relational database every one workload day customer come gone much data make cost sense complexity sense anymore happened demanded customer ask really demand database actually company like lyft million driver geolocation coordinate want relational database expensive complicated performing enough want fast high throughput low latency key value store built dynamodb workload requires latency want database built elasticache redis memcached want connect data multiple big database data want graph database built neptune lot iot like many customer actually trying measure change time want database anchored variable time time series built announced timestream run supply chain want type transparent mutable cryptographically verifiable ledger want ledger database built qldb company lot work json document want document database built documentdb mongodb compatible set database come thing listened developer care optimize customer experience lot developer look list database say `` pretty awesome selection unlike others one obvious missing one understand help u obvious one cassandra people say `` well look manage cassandra tell like manage cassandra kind story thing trying move cloud hard manage hardware hard manage software turn really diﬃcult scale scale peak sitting lot wasted cost rollback feature cassandra pretty clunky people often operating old version cassandra dangerous obvious reason security customer said `` something lot customer get large scale cassandra tend move dynamodb company like nike samsung done understandably company said `` want move want able use cassandra interface want scale excited announce today preview amazon managed cassandra service new managed cassandra service compatible 3.11 release cluster manage latency workload choose provision certain amount think need know must certain point choose provision demand pay demand us cassandra tool driver easy migrate cassandra workload cloud integrated across various aws platform capability use part platform excited give cassandra user capability today think collection database wo find collection anywhere else company say `` know need many database relational database take care nod say yes company say `` database key value really well document really well graph really well time series really well listen polite skeptical swiss army knife hardly ever best solution anything simple task want right tool right job give differentiated performance productivity customer experience want right built database job strong belief inside aws one tool rule world right tool right job make spend le money productive change customer experience mentioned earlier transformation transform transformation adjust changing environment like seeing huge amount data changing technology transformation relatively understood walk little bit le well understood journey case machine learning first several year developer data scientist company passionate excited getting value data machine learning willing deal clunky tool walk 500 mile get however david brent shafermany know people willing walk 500 mile lot tried machine learning last year aws continues mission allow get want get done get value data using machine learning much easier ever lot machine learning happening aws grown substantially think sometimes people forget machine learning something called machine learning got start right highly reliable available scalable data store need right access control right security top right analytics right machine learning capability nobody collection capability machine learning like aws ten thousand customer using u machine learning twice much machine learning aws find anywhere else lot company know intuit fico ge change healthcare guardian volkswagen nfl nascar formula one expedia ford dow jones broad array company leveraging aws machine learning look future machine learning one area become increasingly excited think completely change world change outcome everybody room machine learning help health care one leading company health care world cerner going welcome stage ceo cerner brent shafer share transforming health care aws thank andrew thanks aws opportunity today share story core cerner health care technology company developed software power health care delivery throughout patient lifetime across multiple venue provider care helping health system eﬃciently manage complex billing revenue cycle global company managing data nearly 250 million people around world every day close 3 million health care professional 30 country access secure system 23 petabyte cerner one largest collection personal health information world tremendous opportunity transform world population transformation something accustomed 40 year ushered health care digital age moving medical data paper chart manila folder electronic health record process nearly complete providing organized view patient medical history also improving communication among care team overall quality care know health care journey continuous improvement lot globally think 7 trillion spent health care year united state alone account roughly half recently american medical association estimated 1/4 u.s. spending health care nearly 1 trillion wasted waste come many form come variation care delivery come sometimes overtreating patient know sure data gap lead challenge patient age receive care different doctor different facility spread across country volume data care delivery requires new tool let start thinking bigger cerner really making world health care data actionable example made paper data accessible going digital working reducing variation provider actually deliver care rest health care really done well yet learning predicting preventing problem leveraging power data done know leverage power data really well amazon web service delighted july year announced expansion aws collaboration help u drive strategic priority around migration modernization innovation migrating privately hosted platform aws joint pledge responsible ethical treatment health care data want modernize way deliver solution enabling data science scale really using infrastructure machine learning service help u innovating leveraging service new solution marketplace goal overall improve patient outcome reduce administrative operational complexity predict prevent health issue early possible let look 2 example may know hear lot press unnecessary visit hospital huge contributor waste health care system call readmission readmission basically redo think taking car local mechanic something fixed within 30 day back mechanic shop done basically work expensive frustrating ideally second time readmission happen health care readmission cost actually higher initial visit 2/3 common diagnosis could predict readmission something help clinician modify treatment plan possibly prevent first place course much better patient better caregiver better family save cost one largest health care provider united state asked u help predict patient risk readmitted leveraged five year aws data aggregated together data aggregated aws use machine learning service build train deploy predictive model prediction caregiver change approach discharging patient really key preventing second episode care often significant patient traumatic brain spinal cord injury stroke neurological condition many andrew r. jassyso model creating knowledge skill capability health care system cerner collaboration really made possible cloud infrastructure provided aws result health care system reported lowest readmission rate decade simultaneously increasing discharged community rate mean basically fewer patient readmitted patient returning home course would prefer leverage infrastructure machine learning service aws expect see success like another example work aws really focused returning joy practicing medicine read popular press hear one thing hear united state 40 physician report feel depressed burned stress role part certainly spending half day often documenting information data entry really become burden yes digitized health care time documentation requirement gone way could reduce eliminate data entry physician mean think incredible opportunity cerner developing virtual scribe application capture interaction using speech recognition suggest allergy medication medical problem integrates information directly physician workﬂow using aws transcribe medical speech recognition power innovation confident aws clear leadership voice speech expertise health care workﬂows give doctor time spend patient really want excited collaboration help u move closer cerner vision vision really seamless

really honor u partnered cerner way small part helping change health care outcome really appreciate partnership thought would spend little bit time sharing view machine learning continues evolve continue believe 3 macro layer stack machine learning bottom layer expert machine learning practitioner comfortable framework level group deal 3 primary framework tensorflow pytorch mxnet tensorflow resident largest community today continues lot tensorflow experience look amount tensorflow run cloud 85 tensorflow cloud run aws lot customer running team nothing work optimizing tensorflow performance aws done lot innovation built tensorflow find anywhere done thing really changed scale eﬃciency achieve close linear scalability across hundred gpus done inventing innovating way tensorflow share model parameter multiple instance making sharing faster eﬃcient instance separable team tensorflow optimize performance think also pretty big difference others cloud provider try funnel everybody tensorflow started support little bit framework really vanilla version box tune leaf work little bit prophecy everybody using tensorflow one thing realized done research talked developer data scientist 90 data scientist use multiple framework algorithm invented time people place every type framework people want take time port algorithm back tensorflow support 3 major framework equally well dedicated team work tensorflow team work pytorch mxnet yield different result let give example look common computer vision algorithm called mask previously fastest time run company mountain view 35 minute using hardware available kind private data look team worked tensorflow aws innovation done mentioned able get done 20 faster 28 minute using p3 instance available actually care support major framework tensorflow pytorch team mxnet team also optimize algorithm ran actually 22 faster time 27 minute always going give major tool need job going make decision must use give right tool right job many expert machine learning practitioner world exist kind hang tech company really want machine learning expansive believe make accessible everyday developer data scientist built sagemaker launched couple year ago really change ease developer data scientist build train tune deploy machine learning model incredible many customer started using sagemaker already ten thousand customer thousand standardizing top sagemaker avis squibb cond nast dow jones ge hurst liberty mutual panasonic siemens broad group sagemaker team gotten lot great input developer thank keep coming please hard work launched 50 feature last year touch year ago launched ground truth make much easier label data gave marketplace give hundred algorithm others use machine learning first build reinforcement learning service like sagemaker people using conjunction deepracer year way deepracer championship right werner keynote thursday always able training sagemaker spot may take little bit longer training save 90 built something called neo let train compile practically every imaginable place edge type capability make sagemaker much easier use popular customer said `` made much easier machine learning made every step easier still true work step giving visibility figuring going right wrong still lot harder wished could say always true software development integrated development environment ides problem never really ide machine learning excited announce sagemaker studio first fully integrated development environment machine learning sagemaker studio based ide allows store collect thing need whether code notebook data set setting project holder one place one pane glass make much easier actually manage piece building model thought would share thing part sagemaker making available today first notebook think lot people know notebook machine learning place people use build machine learning workﬂows contain section code documentation visualization result sagemaker notebook paired compute turn need compute le compute actually go spin another instance work transfer content first notebook new notebook little bit tedious customer ask u make easier excited announce launch sagemaker notebook notebook elastic compute spin notebook click happens second turn need compute thought notebook tell u cpu want notebook manage compute heavy lifting transferring content first notebook second notebook shutting first notebook want much easier way manage notebook people said `` well great notebook important part machine learning let tell another problem machine learning trying kind experiment iterating like crazy across lot different parameter dimension iterate lot creates artifact live place ca find ca share please make easier excited announce launch sagemaker experiment way capture organize search every step building training tuning model automatically sagemaker experiment allows capture input variable parameter configuration result automatically save sagemaker call experiment multiple experiment project browse active experiment see real time also search older experiment name input parameter data set use algorithm even result much much easier way find search collect share experiment building model much easier way manage notebook much easier way manage experiment people say `` well make training easier training actually quite different lot different reason least trying work across dozen dozen parameter lot time really know dimension really impacting model looking trained model little bit like looking compiled binary understand application work totally opaque like gibberish naked eye people want better idea driving model adjust fix explain excited announce sagemaker debugger allows developer debug profile model training improve accuracy machine learning model debugger default done bunch work 3 major framework sagemaker automatically setting metric want monitor see actually happening capability debugger called feature prioritization put spotlight actual dimension feature impact model 3 useful thing mean first actually know driving model hugely helpful training model second thing turn underperforming neural network model might want know dimension leaving could actually help understand getting prediction match think case also model feature prioritization show overly reliant number dimension might bias model want change useful help train understand matter also able interpret model easier manage notebook experiment debugging profiling capability people say `` help model working long period time sudden look like prediction relevant anymore happens sometimes like take overly simplified example let say built model 2016 estimated housing price well model worked well worked well primarily condition 2018 interest rate changed housing price went model stopped making accurate prediction concept machine learning people call concept drift actually know concept drift actually make change model turn overwhelming majority model way complicated simple example gave really hard find concept drift kind data wrangling look model data model trained model making prediction different changed really complicated excited help solve today sagemaker model monitor way detect concept drift monitoring model deployed production automatically concept drift create set baseline statistic data train model actually analyze prediction compare data used create model give way visualize appears concept drift see sagemaker studio take charge figure make adjustment got situation concept drift thing mentioned notebook experiment training debugging profile concept drift assuming building model know whole bunch data set useful people time wherewithal capability train model data set simple example would let say operational database data set sale lead lead actually ended becoming real sale actually build simple model predicted variable lead convert sale would spend scarce resource particular opportunity promise talked past something people call automl automatic machine learning model couple problem though look automl model people tried roll first build okay simple model initially total black box turn want improve mediocre model want evolve something matter matter business idea model built nothing turn want make tradeoff maybe case may take absolute best accuracy may trade little accuracy something like faster latency prediction given nature application luck one simple black box model customer said `` want automl want visibility happy announce sagemaker autopilot automl full control visibility automl happens send u csv file matt woodwith data want model point s3 location autopilot transformation model put format could machine learning selects right algorithm train 50 unique model little bit different configuration various variable know one going lead highest accuracy way even know build machine learning model train 50 model take quite bit time useful give sagemaker studio model leader board see 50 model ranked order accuracy give notebook underneath every single one model open notebook recipe particular model tell built tell configuration tell parameter tell algorithm give whole recipe want take model evolve make something really change business long period time also look model leaderboard 50 algorithm may look difference algorithm 1 algorithm 2 difference accuracy tiny difference latency significant make application make prediction much quicker may choose take one autopilot allows automl way let create model automatically give full visibility control able evolve model make look sagemaker today sagemaker become change ability build train tune deploy machine learning model sagemaker studio giant leap forward first ide machine learning going make even easier everyday developer data scientist build machine learning model show whole thing come together pleasure welcome stage every year inevitable dr. matt wood thank andy good morning everybody sagemaker studio pull together first time dozen machine learning tool single pane glass contains tool need build train tune deploy machine learning model aim want able provide machine learning put hand even developer data scientist done past going give guided tour sagemaker today using simple example going build machine learning model predicts house price going using couple simple parameter thing like number bedroom number bathroom individual house along thing like mortgage rate price going go ahead collect machine learning learns example example better collect sale information across u.s. simply take wrap csv file drop s3 move sagemaker studio click inside ide launch new autopilot job simply tell sagemaker model data sagemaker autopilot point start spin multiple different model different set algorithm data set parameter dirty secret machine learning train single model train dozen pick best one sagemaker using information automatically pick train algorithm parameter train multiple different model iteratively showing 4 next iteration pick best feature using machine learning hood order seed next iteration next iteration time sagemaker autopilot start home best set algorithm data feature parameter provide best possible model provides ranked leader board candidate model ranked accuracy almost case going want choose model one best accuracy sagemaker studio using debugger hood providing profiling information autopilot automatically generating notebook dive one individual model get closer look look exactly sagemaker autopilot pull together data look exact parameter exact algorithm use generate using debugger hood default start inspect feature prioritization inside model allows new level visibility insight pick best model right accuracy also meet expectation whether treating data correctly whether model potentially contains bias point selected model want deploy single click inside sagemaker studio get deployed turn sagemaker model monitor step step start compare data used make prediction baseline data used train model point sagemaker model monitor start detect statistical deviation give alert really good indicator want able go back look model potentially retrain data see mean mortgage rate data started change probably something interest rate point jump back studio either pull notebook start scratch using autopilot train another set model probably new fresh data go process select model deploy production go fully managed elastic environment model monitoring continue detects deviation going forward first time sagemaker studio start pull together tool developer used using traditional software debugger profilers automation management single pane glass used build andrew r. jassytrain deploy manage machine learning model way way easier way accessible even developer even data scientist hand back andy thanks thank dr. wood always love dr. wood presentation appreciate okay talked bottom layer stack expert machine learning practitioner middle layer stack sagemaker sagemaker studio everyday developer data scientist top layer stack call ai service service closely mimic human cognition broad array service vision thing called rekognition thing like

accurate answer natural language query using machine learning model continuously improve machine learning expertise incredibly exciting able reinvent search machine learning hand back andy thanks thank dr. wood excited see kendra look machine learning end end said earlier sometimes people trick thinking machine learning like service single service machine learning need right highly secure highly reliable fully featured data store right access control right security broadest set analytics really robust offering 3 layer machine learning stack believe company modern technology capability future clearly operate 3 layer stack machine learning needed nobody set capability collectively like aws twice many company using aws machine learning anybody else think transformation mentioned earlier thing transform thing transform meet new technical opportunity situation one thing notice get first 5 piece transformation talked oftentimes people get addled ca figure move every last workload workload must remain somewhere cloud sometimes stall plan make transformation easy run hide angst big change got make accomplish much see type activity thought process sometimes various company hard task making big transformation ca figure move every last workload know move forward sometimes something tried help last number year continuing make easier customer mention 3 first really around customer say `` moving overwhelming majority application cloud workload stay premise maybe close something like factory help kind got started unusual deep partnership vmware joint offering spent bunch time together working launching called vmware cloud aws allow customer use software tool used manage infrastructure via vmware also use manage infrastructure aws something customer excited managed service vmware run sort like fair bit traction 4x customer year ago time 9x number vms number company know using like cerner accenture pennymac p global script state louisiana customer appropriately said `` well great love use tool managed infrastructure manage aws make easier move application cloud application told guy keep much something thinking last year model try solve issue heard customer work provided solution different apis different tool different control play different hardware really hard customer use surprising taking 2 thing different cloud try connect 2 thing together clunky bridge end something clunky hard use thought problem took different approach thought le building clunky bridge 2 different thing distributing aws announced last year keynote building something called aws outpost outpost rack aws server deliver data center got aws compute storage database analytics decide composition want deliver plug set maintain patch lot work announced coming year ago lot customer conversation thing really important build inside excited announce general availability today aws outpost outpost come ec2 eb ec eks emr vpcs rds adding s3 first half 2020 bunch thing time make run workload need live close something aws apis aws control plane aws hardware tool allow leverage learning seamlessly connect aws application public region really easy get started go console set outpost decide composition want computer storage database deliver outpost door install handle maintenance plugged power network able see new aws outpost aws management console able use provision resource outpost excited available today come 2 variant somebody used want use aws apis control plane operate outpost alongside rest aws public region use aws native outpost available today somebody want still use vmware control plane like using vmware cloud aws number customer use variant outpost vmware cloud aws outpost available early part 2020 excited give today solve issue certain workload need live premise data center ca move cloud second barrier hearing number customer particularly larger organization say `` end user particular geography workload need millisecond latency data center kind colo clunky gpus desk want manage anymore interesting issue well cloud provider like u expensive launch mega region like 200 300 city around world lot coming know really contemplated 200 300 thought issue thought actually provide solution take typical example real example medium company l.a. content creation video game workload building need millisecond latency take company new york switzerland financial service close market data need millisecond latency thought different type construct provide solves issue scale excited announce type aws infrastructure deployment called local zone new type infrastructure deployment place compute storage database service close large city starting l.a. local zone available today invitation local zone compute storage database available kind went back root little bit solving problem said `` think history aws built highly ﬂexible building block build lot top think many service aws service service built top thing like s3 ec2 worrying thinking type problem local zone realize outpost really useful ﬂexible building block taken outpost done innovation variance customer could bring outpost data center area want data center built local zone metro city building manage outpost compute storage database analytics millisecond latency end user metro city need latency get job done first one available l.a. today expect u moving forward solve workload stay data center solve workload certain geography end user need millisecond latency want data center han e. vestberg andrew r. jassy han e. vestbergthe third barrier increasingly hearing customer mobile connected device world connected stealth network get type millisecond latency well promise 5g people become curious started believe possible like new technology true cloud big data machine learning iot becoming true quantum computing true 5g well lot hype lot misunderstanding technology want try figure collectively leverage 5g give type customer experience first really understand 5g leverage ca think somebody better explain u 5g work close partner ceo verizon han vestberg please join u andrew great thank welcome han appreciate let start question heck really 5g different much better 4g matter folk matter lot room matter lot 5g different g ever seen think 2g 4g basically took 2g phone sm voice today 4g phone great experience verizon phone stream 2 different capability speed throughput 2 5g actually 8 capability call 8 currency 8 currency give example understand big difference speed going 4g phone today 40 60 megabit per second 10 gigabit per second individual device 5g phone room right 1.2 1.8 gigabit already 5g speed throughput going terabyte per square kilometer today gigabyte per square kilometer latency super important service developing going maybe 40 80 millisecond 10 millisecond latency network combine also many device connect today connect 100,000 device per square kilometer 5g 1 million much people device go currency think important slice give individual application thing transformative technology going transform consumer behavior going transform business going transform society andrew r. jassy han e. vestberg andrew r. jassyyou need build certain way need fiber basically load radio base station need spectrum need sdn network need virtualize network need lot real estate edge verizon build 8 currency everyone going build right say want give customer already launched 5g home 2018 home broadband launched 5g mobility april 18 city want 30 course continuing lot new innovation start 8 currency matter everybody develop new thing bringing 5g pretty awesome people wo tethered anymore lte network think first spectrum position millimeter wave big frequency get enormous throughput get 10 gig latency 10 millisecond course secondly connectivity speed 2 thing thing 5g bring processing edge virtualized network bring call mobile edge compute 5g really innovation consumer low latency immersive experience machine load heavy happen edge right virtualized network 8 currency yes make sense well could tell 5g pretty compelling think thought mean aws customer want type application connectivity actually something meaningful application always need amount compute amount storage done past reached aws go get compute storage problem many hop along way like go device cell tower city aggregation site regional aggregation site internet aws back type application excited using 5g thing like machine learning edge autonomous industrial equipment smart car city augmented virtual reality ca afford want round trip back forth really want want aws embedded somehow 5g edge location think customer want ca walk telco say `` edge one telco serve entire world geographically go lot telco say `` edge manage work different telco manage kind abstraction still want api han e. vestbergtools apis control plane thing sort hard problem people try solve 18 month ago han team team started working collaborated deeply excited announce new aws service called aws wavelength allows build application deliver digit millisecond latency mobile connected device aws compute storage embedded edge 5g done embedded aws storage compute edge 5g network started verizon collaboration partner really true innovator space sensitive portion application want millisecond latency way fewer hop actually get compute storage go device aggregation city aggregation site right 5g city aggregation site aws much better experience worry launching first launch partner verizon also kddi sk telecom vodafone part time worry figuring manage across different telco built abstraction make easy said started verizon often leader innovator space tends invest network thank thank u historic day mean said first 5g home first 5g mobility world course today talk bringing 5g mobile edge compute edge call verizon 5g edge collaboration engineer working together 18 month virtualize network way radio packet core bring wavelength order create platform actually start innovating 8 currency low latency massive throughput think massive moment u verizon actually lead sort movement world lot transformation new platform already preview chicago already customer using technology much buzzword actually preview nfl bethesda gaming company using low latency time able slice currency together aws wavelength move load course way higher level data center wavelength beauty going game changer think everyone extremely excited verizon extremely excited collaborate best greatest cloud company world bring innovator really want see today go booth verizon booth actually start experience 8 currency year progress 2020 going deploy much real estate andrew r. jassy han e. vestberg andrew r. jassy han e. vestberg andrew r. jassycomes edge compute together aws see bringing innovate customer partner great day case obvious pretty excited giving think complete think pretty dramatically change customer going able get done could chosen better collaboration partner deep partnership love working verizon team han thank much thank great thank thank man talked making big transformation sometimes happens company get stalled ca figure move every last workload spent fair bit time trying solve continue work trying solve moving forward 3 big barrier think able help knock deal application stay data center want work seamlessly rest aws application deal end user geography need millisecond latency want data center work seamlessly rest aws application leverage incredible innovation 5g millisecond latency connected device part application 3 big barrier knocked today going close comment think big change happening think change happening move cloud titanic shift seen technology lifetime sometimes hard think handle think lot people tell love embrace change would say experience necessarily true think lot people get nervous change know mean whether skill successful change mean scope job thing spend lot time working supplier built relationship lot time big change transformation like first reaction dismiss becomes hard dismiss people moving value reaction oftentimes `` well better le expensively performantly appear true lot time reaction try slow roll enough nod look like actually paying attention problem dip toe water long period time transformation radically change industry find tail end big shift suddenly way behind sometimes pretty startling far behind become quickly mean history business littered company adjust big technical transformation left dust reality cloud offer give lifetime chance totally reinvent customer experience totally reinvent business build thing never possible opportunity u unlike lifetime probably unlike moving forward opportunity right right take every step way help hope great rest week invent thank
