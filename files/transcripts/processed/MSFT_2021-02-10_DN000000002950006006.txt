helping fuel point sort longevity look pretty excited growth seeing always catch mentioned big business always always got kind remember big business sort temporary outcome basic thing aspect business every time speak microsoft get sense growth driven new workload trying think migration transition take point lift shift right much still around looking microsoft server business 25 year got massive massive installed base got big market share right ever start quarter moving cloud point yeah look think definitely seeing right mean think see significant migration existing workload window linux sequel right like microsoft core component lot lot exciting open source development migration say well definitely big component would like said new workload sure driving lot incremental growth know think trade hybrid actually big selling point big value add customer right hybrid story sort enabling customer think digital transformation cloud answer right think capability like like azure arc creates sort unified experience kash rangan corey sander kash rangan corey sander kash rangancloud enabling run thing like current sort managed data service place allows customer make digital transformation step without boundary whether going public cloud result still buy addition growing cloud think great outcome customer right really sort sort boundary condition sort limitation take digital transformation way want think unique set offering enable customer see growth right something think get question lot car growing server component right customer growing sort hybrid picture enabling seamlessly got one point time two transfer going sort parallel cloud development azure stack still remember heard azure stack early could brieﬂy newer upgrading azure stack seeing actually even positive business still seeing lot business workload going microsoft longer period time make decision go cloud going benefit right yeah exactly mean think azure stack sort bringing first component overall picture hybrid yet point mean really offering choice really saying look picking sort sequel use sort best example make tough decision cloud manage vms giving choice able use sql however want use wherever want use think value add point going keep using sql think bill see value sort renewal conversation continue expand even usage sql continue grow right one example type product

business around covid cloud significant way seeing benefit important market share whatnot prognostication get benefit computer sense undergrad person credential able viewpoint see database cloud microsoft positioned future could potentially yeah walking sort one favorite maybe topic think differentiator azure synapse link product one thing sort go depth database challenge customer sort split data operational data thing supporting website right analytics data rate thing sort running overnight sort deciding hey product put first page second whatever retail example go everywhere one biggest cost customer trying bring operational data analytics data calculation run like many customer year basically every night run big etl process cost whole lot money sector think future database opportunity able one global scale database longer spin one place click button got seven place worldwide support website synapse link something recently announced allows database term effectively join operational data analytics data effectively run analytics query determine sort right product show page without moving data anywhere without duplicating data basically hold operator possible type cloud innovation know database going built deployed way know analytics service going deployed way make connection behind scene save customer time money energy sort point mentioned even beginning one biggest silo data exist world unique solution got little bit bit byte think think direction database generally cloud going break barrier going little manage going little extra processing need done going consider data one entity going pick choose value want get want operational store great click go want run query click go little work make work together anyway got really exciting point sorry went long corey sander kash rangan corey sandersthat great start partnering writing business cloud butter decade back great see segment opportunity comparative market share gain displacement legacy database something microsoft giving attention big market yeah mean think one big thing focus choice running think look sort modern capability sort global scale look something like cosmos db built around open source database solution cosmos db basically click button fully managed global database built whole bunch open source model go use allows easily move perhaps feel sort legacy database sort feel weight legacy data able make migration solution aggressively think going see lot customer move digital transformation decide need global scale solution hard manage existing one think continue see legacy data base move infrastructure think making sure customer going key earnings call announcement company talked 10 billion type transaction azure microsoft 365 speak customer thinking microsoft positioned
