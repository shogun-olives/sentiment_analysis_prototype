great thank good morning colette good morning bmo listener viewer real special thanks colette may aware lot fire brewing part wood colette happens close thank colette really appreciate taking time despite mind elsewhere well thank joining u absolutely thank joining u question answer pleasure talk today reported earnings last week maybe start near term real quick expecting business near term visibility various segment could please start colette kressthank yes let start group whole say nvidia lately want think company post overall mellanox let focus couple piece talk seeing future term near term first nvidia overall computing adoption computing adoption accelerating many different piece example gaming emerged probably would refer leading form entertainment exactly growing growing worldwide nvidia term rtx stand ray tracing taken opportunity redefine graphic period time geforce continued solidify world number one gaming platform one piece overall computing move overall data center taken opportunity launch next architecture ampere architecture start new product cycle available platform first brought overall data center biggest generational base architecture already started strong a100 first product a100 demand strong still early ramp le quarter half since launched still le 1/4 recent reported result q2 data center hyperscale adoption going well ramp industry even started yet still future continuing ramp a100 ampere architecture first quarter mellanox mellanox closed beginning q2 allowing cloud scale ai service within quarter accelerating growth overall mellanox platform also included many product bringing market a100 dgx dgx superpod future egx well agx overall product set even dealing california remember worldwide dealing execute within overall pandemic ambrish srivastavawe quite well integrating overall mellanox overall launching a100 bringing dgxs producing selene dgx superpod well lot different multiple software stack also put market delivered strong quarter keep mind employee remain working home covid negative impact professional visualization auto business case impact overall economics due shutdown believe short term hope return quarter future question really see near term looking term next quarter move forward provided guidance next quarter 4.4 billion total revenue 14 sequentially 45 gaming expected grow expected grow 25 sequentially q3 data center also expected grow low digit sequentially well data center would approximately 150 growth case still economic impact enterprise many using cloud continue roll a100 keep mind still seeing enterprise industry impacted overall covid pandemic good visibility hyperscale demand turn corner q3 majority data center growth q3 coming nvidia compute versus overall networking side looking automotive professional visualization move q3 expect similar level q2 kind summary seeing hope see future look q3 great thank actually wanted focus trend business segment colette kressso maybe start gaming clearly strong quarter guide big guide see benefit play home work home couple question one sustainability growth seeing also colette business changed lot laptop become pretty meaningful portion business u following tend think old gaming business mostly desktop switch came along two three year ago question number one think sustainability strength seeing question number two think seasonality mix lot different used sure let remind everybody overall q2 q2 demand across gaming demand across region different product well different channel correct multiple piece including desktop including laptop including overall console work well turing demand continues strong turing architecture several year still see strong adoption due overall covid really strength bringing rtx overall gaming rtx ability ray tracing one market platform enable overall ray tracing speaking overall strong laptop growth seen continuing provide great price point purchase laptop overall also ability get ray tracing example ray tracing price point 999 including 2060 additionally also taken turing overall laptop low price point 699 overall laptop gtx 1650 ambrish srivastava colette kressso thing continue fuel overall laptop growth think u quite time additionally seen overall ecosystem support overall gaming platform overall rtx dl content continues grow right 30 rtx game announced and/or shipping including famous one minecraft cyberpunk death stranding super important ecosystem pole drive people look overall gaming solution play exciting game incorporate overall ray tracing turing still le third installed base time common stage product life cycle still significant headroom overall upgrade feel good momentum going second half year generally second half year tends little bit larger h1 year people get ready back school also term key holiday season start early western holiday move way asia pacific holiday beginning next year well thing see long term think gaming believe created environment providing overall ray tracing many different platform great overall entertainment medium continue time okay good think one thing mentioned call also game developer console coming also accelerating across platform help business well right correct continue term working game developer think holiday season year fueled lot possible new console coming overall market great game development game development continues spark need overall hardware know two year making working overall ray tracing working much overall ecosystem drive game ambrish srivastava colette kresswill coming market okay awesome wanted switch data center seems step back look longer term going compute demand versus unmet need quite ball started rolling along nvidia solution mention mellanox acquisition jumped made acquisition usually skeptical deal announced think business around 300 quarter reported growth lack better word question data center start addressed visibility part earlier earnings call talked certain vertical going weaker a100 starting ramp think a100 business surprised 25 business already given launched kitchen top ttc jensen conducted initial demand seeing top stack virtualized gpu environment adopted hyperscalers something different could touch initial uptake a100 sure let kind frame term saw q2 give great recognition mellanox acquisition overall result q2 data center growth rate great growth nvidia compute also included inclusion overall mellanox nvidia compute side within q2 continue accelerate growth versus prior quarter mellanox also reached overall record level maybe something long period time took u reach regulatory close nobody noticing great overall work mellanox opened product portfolio term work establishing many ai compute cluster happening across hyperscales across enterprise give great kudos mellanox work excited well within quarter overall q2 established ability u take overall accelerated computing farther overall compute side absorb ability look acceleration focus overall networking model keep mind overall data center tam close 50 billion even prior overall mellanox mellanox could add another 20 billion term overall tam look result term q2 data center moved annual run rate 7 billion two u together interesting overall announcement overall a100 stepping back little bit actually announcement ampere architecture first product overall a100 a100 important ampere important key thing focusing building overall architecture overall product address seen term overall ai data analytics lot focused model complexity model complexity last three year essentially prior launching overall v100 probably grown 3,000x lot thing seeing work every single day including deep recommendators conversational ai natural language processing required strongly increasing overall model complexity overall launching a100 provided unique architecture product allows overall customer choose whether needed product inferencing trading a100 key term seeing term uplift limitation right bat term complexity model a100 given tremendous improvement performance versus v100 allows take overall size model also continue term expanding workload migrate cloud key area overall growth particularly time cloud becomes important enterprise overall hyperscales ambrish srivastava colette kressbut also able unlock new workload new market particularly area data science heard u discus term work importance data science importance apache spark apache spark gpu accelerated expanded 500,000 overall data science well 16,000 enterprise use ability data science using overall gpu acceleration speeding significant amount work going back overall ampere architecture a100 yes le 25 overall data center revenue q2 keep mind early stage ramp record fast ramp already cloud platform google fastest ramp history moving overall a100 cloud platform month cloud provider coming soon azure also announced last week announcement a100 instance also available also scale thousand overall gpus turn corner q3 q4 see system available many server manufacturer dell hp lenovo many others path allowing a100 continue reach enterprise enterprise outside overall cloud instance term premise edge feel really great term well overall ramp gone excited term work team get a100 launched given term overall pandemic growth durability platform continue drive growth trend going forward great one question mentioned azure announcement also incorporating mellanox right yes ambrish srivastava colette kress right question development collaborating close combination separate decision microsoft made yes worked overall azure announcement logged quite bit excitement bringing market super record fast ramp azure allows scale everything one vm eight a100 gpus one time hundred vms running thousand gpus also incorporates infiniband interconnect demonstration yes nvidia mellanox working together even prior overall deal continue look overall universe area mellanox customer set mellanox project also benefit nvidia gpus and/or vice versa nvidia gpus incorporating overall mellanox also add value overall customer ability azure case accelerate full stack hardware software networking together really true test term data center architecture really evolving evolving think different component together think disaggregation compute overall occur sale team working together case case working mellanox completed work together future opportunity u together also great opportunity road map alignment move forward right see u unique product coming market announced product together mellanox inside many nvidia overall system bringing together happen term road map think future great start already ambrish srivastava colette kress ambrish srivastava mentioned apache spark 3.0 announced think june july prior solution kind tam opening nvidia data science side yes spark really great platform leading term data analytics open source discussed 500,000 probably data scientist important part work accelerated rather ineﬃcient process data scientist process term reworking algorithm reworking overall abstraction data quite ineﬃcient excited announce work overall apache spark gpu accelerator mean gpus accelerate entire platform etl refers extract transform load essentially pre data processing part training also inferencing result overall query data scientist put used take hour something done term minute excited work term work spark outcome came perfect a100 unified architecture take advantage one final question data center know bunch question line well mentioned run rate 7 billion run rate part business nascent market point reaching point thinking sort seasonality business mellanox worth colette kress ambrish srivastava colette kress ambrish srivastavaif could touch still continue look data center buildup together overall mellanox solidified still case work company really based building seasonality seem apparent time last several quarter overall project breadth depth continues build excited continues show build project rather overall seasonality okay sound like least near medium term also characteristic lumpy business given explained project see pipeline ramp okay helpful right gave overall guidance overall q3 looked outward term expecting data center business based fairly good visibility overall q3 keep mind move forward continue provide generally provide guidance one quarter right staying long term one really jumped least mercedes announcement automotive side sound like mean longer term could potentially really transformative business relates recurring revenue talk thinking kind timing colette kress ambrish srivastavaand second nearer term get headwind infotainment behind u start see work automotive guy ai side ada side start kick yes sure let start first legacy infotainment revenue currently right approximately half business little le term q2 area legacy infotainment overall longer strategic focus u long design win continue provide overall strategic priority reside term av ai overall cockpit go forward seen challenge last q2 really also affected overall pandemic shutdown overall manufacturing overall purchasing probably see return starting see automotive manufacturing start pick keep mind infotainment business necessarily planned overall growth move forward let kind turn focused importance overall announcement really great example overall mercedes working nvidia term developing overall hardware full overall technology stack car overall entire ﬂeet deal overall ai av move forward vehicle continue future upgradable likely air life overall vehicle give u opportunity upgrade thousand dollar per vehicle across million overall vehicle plan transformational deal mercedes share overall revenue two company believe opportunity quite large believe margin quite rich well case see overall production likely calendar 2024 see overall head overall market excited term important transformation deal think continue lead others really focusing streamline think building complex overall av solution going forward colette kress ambrish srivastava colette kressi question capital allocation given current uncertainty around covid understandable conservative paying debt raised close mellanox paused share buyback could talk capital allocation thinking sure correct completed acquisition mellanox 7 billion cash currently right 11 billion cash book keep mind also 7 billion overall debt currently book capital allocation focused dividend continuing dividend program overall buyback overall ongoing review opportunity three key area focus term capital allocation case buyback probably depend mostly overall marketing market condition may consistently evaluate time time overall repurchase stock great point going pause poll question operator instruction let okay first one line colette relationship nvidia tsmc thinking relationship going forward yes super important relationship relationship tsmc partner 20 year relationship built understanding process also u understanding tsmc process keep mind dual fab provider work tsmc work others important piece u think overall enterprise risk one several year working across overall fab provider relationship bringing overall ampere could pleased work together tsmc ambrish srivastava colette kress ambrish srivastava okay second question think impact extra week january quarter relates revenue and/or opex yes correct year extra week 53 week within fiscal year extra week hit q4 q4 provided overall guidance opex basis gaap basis term operating expense gave last quarter confirmed overall q3 guidance full year extra week incorporated within guidance key thing overall headcount cost compensation benefit well extra week overall depreciation many asset well lease would thing incorporate within q4 extra week revenue standpoint discussed term data center data center business essentially gamers gamer space term many gamers overall expect anything really change overall revenue profile inaudible hmm keep going sound seems stop okay hope answer gentleman question wanted touch upon something actually good question asked earnings call jensen addressed importance process technology seven nanometer ampere chip really put engineering hat wow many transistor back right way think moore law slowing way think importance process technology nvidia solution colette kressclearly think tsmc tsmc committed making manufacturing location u.s one company much foundry capacity industry know samsung second source colette cfo business leader given concern possible concern one company control much manufacturing balance concern potential threat geo threat ca predict course manage think outsourcing yes think step back understand lot work even bring new architecture market many year know multiple architecture hopper working bring overall market scenario look architecture across overall fab provider tape and/or bring production allows u continue fabs also continue fabs different type node continue test node along go overall architecture allows u ﬂexibility well understanding overall process technique would beneficial customer workload bringing market dual dual term multiple different node well testing overall fabs think given u ﬂexibility move forward pleased work done across work overall samsung leader well tsmc leader really relationship really understanding process allows u go market successful actual machine work even done afterwards term building product ambrish srivastava colette kressso continue believe relationship strong pleased overall partner think great balance across fabs inaudible sorry question coming back capital allocation looking think mellanox seems like really helped solidify position data center connectivity side also got ethernet criterion area looking bolster compute network yes think look portfolio quite diversified portfolio across gaming across overall enterprise graphic whether virtual reality ar thing term overall design project data center taking overall whole within data center including gpu including overall networking well lot work term storage well overall automotive great unique opportunity overall edge bring inaudible look forward think overall opportunity lot different opportunity many come u thing tend review like review really great strategic team part company tough u really signal specific area lot thing interesting also extremely thoughtful looking know largest reach stage company use believe really drive important strategic change u company ambrish srivastava colette kress ambrish srivastava yes make sense going toggle back line couple question colette number one expected time line autonomous vehicle continues ﬂuctuate back forth probably clearly reﬂection said market nvidia time line launching av robotaxi service key current functional technology bottleneck yes path overall av think many overall manufacturer last couple year really understood complexity overall driving experience amount compute necessary therefore significant amount software widing would happen time car road also use opportunity bifurcate two different path one would robotaxis robotaxis would confined overall area maybe block mile order could provide overall passenger car would continue improve period time starting something level 2 av offering going level 2+ time period car built lot better understanding manufacturer working challenge bringing u number one concern number one concern always going safety safety assurance top priority company focus av move forward possibility strain actually hit market time moved couple year really taking time define test really improve overall platform production overall car moving couple year probably see first production piece road robotaxis well passenger colette kress ambrish srivastava colette kressokay thank another one ada side question ada side collaborating many company across spectrum pure hardware ada solution customer feel supplier potential competitor think opportunity overall ada look opportunity providing av solution synergistic approach manufacturer may building define overall compute long term use type hardware overall ada end solution manufacturer well customer consistent platform well received opportunity go forward area concentration ada always swing pick move overall hiring platform going forward great wrap colette first going say thank good luck u need front closing remark would want leave u would great sure thank opportunity one first ability come earnings love fact virtual experience working well one thing keep mind nvidia overall breadth depth overall portfolio ability accelerate compute overall compute remains data center gpu really focusing compute networking type compute opportunity overall gaming overall gaming term work home work home play home served u well gotten u focus u entertainment medium period ambrish srivastava colette kresswe believe take u second half year well thank interest nvidia hosting call thank thanks simona thanks stewart take care guy back 15 minute thank
