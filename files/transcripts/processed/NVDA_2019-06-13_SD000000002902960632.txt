really excited option increasing expansion overall gaming market many maybe chance realize fun clear view expands market cannibalize existing market definitely near term absolute expansion market many people would like opportunity continue gaming anywhere large amount access gaming fair enough last strategy question earnings call jensen said nvidia accelerator company accelerated computing company message u mean yes accelerator necessary given overall end moore law looking going expand computing eﬃciently future given slowdown moore law use accelerator always option case around time still significant percentage accelerator overall market accelerated mean something added top general purpose overall compute often accelerator limiting accelerator rarely overall programming capability rarely overall software stack order enhance type component underlying platform think focused overall gpus overall future mellanox acquisition thinking entire compute platform thinking accelerating level platform networking level well intersects may happen q unidentified participant colette m. kress q unidentified participant colette m. kress q unidentified participant colette m. kresssoftware networking cpu accelerated computing think thing jointly together term adding okay helpful let go opportunity originally talking gaming side last quarter gaming increased 11 sequentially declined 39 extent 39 decline basis crypto versus inventory pure gaming card since bounce sequentially mean inventory issue behind u sure growth sequentially believe back sequential growth think continue throughout year prior year definitely inﬂuenced availability overall crypto possibility using overall gpu card essentially diﬃcult comp u overcome inventory excess inventory believe part pretty much behind u believe able concentrate full stack turing available market focus great capability ray tracing begin believe hope normalization overall business occurring somewhere q2 q3 okay excellent gaming notebook growing talked gaming notebook opportunity yes great design worked overall oems worldwide realized gamers wanted mobile willing go backwards give thin light wanted thin light wanted high performance time worked design oems incorporating call launched since ce probably 120 different laptop gaming capability also bringing ray tracing consumer prosumer well enterprise capability important great gaming notebook great performance would see desktop well okay opportunity seems ray tracing important ray tracing game available saw press release guy topic week think bring u speed ray tracing yes ray tracing believe essential next generation gaming distinguished piece architecture capability allows thing look near q unidentified participant colette m. kress q unidentified participantreal longer simulating capability ray tracing physic behind actually real time turing card starting well 300 price point lower absolutely use overall ray tracing announced many new game starting back late fall even last 1.5 week computex e3 probably nearly half dozen new game including call duty cyberpunk couple really great game coming endorsement ecosystem game engine building well apis microsoft others begin entire ecosystem focused ray tracing hardware platform focused overall ray tracing really pleased ongoing excitement brought ray tracing okay let shift data center declined 10 7 sequentially think every company sell data center saw great growth last year recently decline think company believe digestion period going data center talk visibility like today data center describe order process forecasting process data center customer pinging asking lead time give visibility program going back half year shine little light process u sure latter half 2018 significant amount purchase worldwide hyperscales others associated overall data center probably would refer little bit much saw turned corner 2019 saw first month january feel lot replanning occurring across world term much purchasing term year replanning took good portion first quarter moved second quarter still little cloudy term see data center believe second half stronger second half return overall purchasing confidence relies overall engagement engineering level several ongoing engagement time across board whether hyperscales whether consumer internet company several enterprise think use gpus broad possible us training inferencing term machine learning overall data science significant amount work leaf u overall confidence case order processing po going use engagement engineering proven timely term think ordering happen customer inference market bright spot data center sequentially talked t4 product colette m. kress q unidentified participant colette m. kress q unidentified
