okay think ready get started thank coming morning toshiya hari cover semiconductor semi cap equipment goldman sachs pleased colette kress chief financial oﬃcer nvidia u morning colette thank taking time busy schedule sure question answer wanted start recapping 2017 year clearly phenomenal year company think business grew double digit exceeded estimate crazy number hoping could go back share surprise year major accomplishment company sure finished fiscal year announced earnings last thursday great year term revenue company well accomplishment made technology standpoint term establishing great market front u closed year 9.7 billion growing 40 4 market platform refer gaming business pro visualization business data center automotive discussed group grew double digit case data center business many people follow quite closely reached almost 2 billion grew 130 extremely strong growth overall platform big year volta platform volta platform blended data center announced gtc last may probably greatest surprise greatest accomplishment overall adoption volta across overall industry starting cst moving quite quickly internal use term training also capability using within cloud seeing many cloud instance come day using overall volta architecture let take away overall gaming business grew quite strong quite strong pascal architecture 1.5 year tremendous success term keeping heart mind overall gamers well bringing new gamers overall market pro vi business established term market well design important piece transformation pro visualization think use ai use virtual reality much design taking place enterprise well started business growing double digit automotive business also growing 10 really associated infotainment system probably key highlight many announcement made throughout year term partnership many auto manufacturer partner tier 1 automotive industry focus car pleased term overall revenue growth also come term overall gross margin know business shipping overall chip best hardware also full stack software many industry started year lot concern term absence internal royalty going expire first quarter ended still growing overall gross margin 100 basis point including term 130 basis point direction absence intel royalty growing 200 basis point term true operation really showing value platform full stack term people appreciating able see term overall gross margin invested business invested business growing opex nearly 20 also producing overall operating income margin expansion margin increased 500 basis point think tremendously great model leveraged overall r team mean leverage focus one product focus gpu able build term also work software stack take one specific market benefited u well think overall investment overall profitability growth growing 60 even term overall eps line summary really solid year taking advantage great large market opportunity front u fortunate thing front u q toshiya hari colette m. kressnot concentrating one large market many large market gaming gaming tremendously healthy get point maybe every person world overall gamer platform able really fuel lot gaming gaming see right game coming many saw holiday season well overall content game demand overall graphic additionally advancement seeing term artificial intelligence use gpu democratizing lot seeing term first stage ai large market front u great see progress year also progress opportunity going forward automotive autonomous driving extension seen data center hard problem solve using artificial intelligence build car future whether level 3 level 4 level 5 going forward excited excited future great thanks much guess hoping could walk u business formation transformation nvidia gone past five year since joined company lot happened stock 15 sitting today 230 completely different company walk u change opportunity different today relative joined company got joining company five year ago discussion would term onstage today versus term 5 year tremendous transformation actually feel transform every day take part term market yes company 25 year making lot really based really strong core technology gpu used even back primarily overall pc platform five year really talk actual transformation actually go back little bit farther yes pc platform great piece u start importance overall processing capability graphic essentially great application use processing capability gpu happened probably 10 12 year ago establishment programmability gpu enabling many establishing cuda establishing cuda several different gpus available time allowed u build overall developer base today developer base grown astronomically exceeds 600,000 developer worldwide established success today data center well pro vi maybe even term artificial intelligence future autonomous driving reason find use case tremendous overall processor solve many challenging problem required much data much processing put together yes five year ago would talking pc market pc market would declining would ﬂat concern term attach rate long time since question really really talk stage q toshiya hari colette m. kresswe term ai big going first car hit freeway see huge change required company keep toe think company probably one agile company really focused thing changing evolve company reach market opportunity great guess wanted dive segment start data center given focus guy focus investor well clearly major growth driver today walk u individual subsegments within data center performed past 12 month sure data center business essentially focused 5 different business within first one probably good percentage overall business focused ai training ai training requires significant amount data process called deep learning allows process data writing software allowing infer large set overall data still significant part business started early stage csps hyperscale provider well use training application internally well application use consumer standpoint overall internet business continued evolve continued grow second key business emerged emerged quite well last year cloud business using overall application hyperscales research team serving different user enterprise researcher get started quite quickly quite differently maybe infrastructure built maybe 10 15 year ago would build cluster within data center allowing ease use researcher well entrant term enterprise use cloud get quickly started ai get quickly started deep learning many different use case overall cloud instance focus creating cloud instance big piece last year say sizing quite well overall deep learning training seeing first business third business focused inferencing inferencing take different stage ai data already trained going focus new incremental data coming processing speed usually referred per second image per second instance per second type case super early stage business using overall gpu traditionally done primarily done cpu market getting complexity type work need done analyzing video example analyzing voice gpu processor actually tremendously beneficial super early stage term market going continue focus future large market u overall capture fourth market computing new business business probably close 15 year large supercomputer around world deep computational type work done performance computing established term top supercomputer world probably 1/5 well top 15 q toshiya hari colette m. kress q toshiya hari colette m. kressoverall application computing using overall gpu acceleration sped year realizing slowdown moore law slowdown using general cpu improve performance time time using something else accelerate overall performance supercomputing gpus established little bit different ai seeing term conversion conversion computing ai together take thing infer using ai deep computational transaction also using term performance computing long design win market likely continue really great part business year last business really focused ai edge autonomous machine people using centrally data center machine pc going forward also great opportunity think smart city think autonomous vehicle still going significant amount work term putting platform different business within data center today okay mentioned early gain inferencing recent call think jensen talked opportunity help u understand big business today within data center view opportunity next say 12 24 month yes business data center today majority stem training cloud computing inferencing still early stage wide set partner overall trailing overall inferencing see inferencing occurring many part world within hyperscale application well still early part business term representative data center business okay understood guess term competitive landscape data center clearly given growth potential multiple competitor aggressively going market got private supposedly emerging sometime year solution well remind u value proposition nvidia differ competition sure mean think artificial intelligence course would lot interest around world folk interested part long term sure going many different player artificial intelligence simply come overall focus focus enabling ai many different platform many different place around world focusing one framework focusing one hyperscale focusing one form computing ability create software stack enables allows quick start term working q toshiya hari colette m. kress q toshiya hari colette m. kresssignificant amount metalware confused always best processor capable handling significant amount data democratize ai many different type population researcher lab higher education enterprise well hyperscales without aligning single one platform really focus thing develop long term probably specialty within see u looking extend work certain industry certain vertical probably add software enable example health care software help term overall manufacturing arm use ai really available almost different type platform guess specifically yesterday get quite question investor amazon announcement google announcement well perhaps address issue well sure discussion people refer custom service time customization see player looking customization specific workload nothing new essentially emerged yesterday google coming gpu 2 allowing beta version cloud seen strategy still remains focused different cloud provider focused different framework enabling nothing new term piece amazon way chip single kind device necessarily large autonomous machine although would probably focused device coming chip specific okay make sense shifting gear little bit wanted ask couple question crypto given focus call last week talked part business bigger percentage business q4 relative q3 know really hard gauge big business help u understand relative size see going next say 4 quarter sure probably interesting part last year fiscal 2018 emergence overhead cryptocurrency necessarily brand new several year ago cryptocurrency popped term bitcoin mining moved overall asics take place right current currency using gpu beneficial work need done last couple quarter watched quite closely important market dynamic popping professional miner starting take place also case extra time outside gaming people also mining may dual q toshiya hari colette m. kress q toshiya hari colette m. kress q toshiya harioverall function term seeing use gpus consumer side tough gauge extremely tough gauge think selling term gpus gpus gaming gpus crypto sold adding card maker sold exact channel case maybe exact customer gaming part time well also mining understand probably looking valuation overall gaming believe amount work need done believe market grew time q3 time q4 see able pinpoint exactly something capability may dual probably evolved since couple quarter ago market dynamic getting critical mass critical mass amount happening cryptocurrency probably underlying trend time carrying forward yes still volatile absolutely okay way manage potential decline crypto pricing gpus ﬂooding market hard manage stage sure path given volatility overall coin sure see additional coin future hard tell point okay got guess talking gaming business still well north 50 inaudible get little air time day given data center crypto 2017 another strong year mostly crypto gaming well drove strength 2017 kind outlook 2018 gaming business still growing strong definitely see success see lot game coming pubg example probably one best game 2017 came started early back fall late reached 25 million 30 million different user gamers new gamers gamers moved new game play continuing upgrade overall pascal cycle thinking gpus tremendous success towards latter half fiscal year though challenge gamers crypto miner point supply constrained gpus lot need meet lot different thing yes overall success gaming clearly seen revenue growth also think overall success growth game easily see colette m. kress q toshiya hari q unidentified participant colette m. kressgreat competitive standpoint clearly done really well gaming past couple year gaming share expense nearest competitor going forward view landscape intel talked coming back got discrete graphic business well multiyear basis see competitive positioning changing yes think focus addressing gamers company unique strategy address overall gaming market many competitor thought chip would establish overall gaming platform much differently focus focus term surrounding overall ecosystem overall gamers providing geforce experience providing overall seamlessness gpu overall playing game remember continuously working many game developer bring life many great feature inside game graphic intensive working many month game ever even come different approach term befriending overall gamers established channel know reach overall gamers inﬂuences gamers coming back time time trusted value best processing capability also great seamlessness understanding overall gaming industry competitor changed much competitor year inﬂuenced type gamers well early entrant early entrant continuing use nvidia product meet different need whether 100 spend whether want 1,000 gpu gaming something think competition always tough nut crack something take couple month strategy well ingrained system ecosystem think stay okay great 8 minute left still bunch question wanted make sure question audience one right seventh row think mentioned earlier last year different driver used crypto mining versus normal gaming able tell difference gpus using used crypto one used mining sorry gaming think latest crypto stuff people using latest nvidia driver hard differentiate right think one thing still overclock memory able figure percentage gpus selling like memory overclock versus normal overclock q toshiya hari q unidentified participant colette m. kressokay let room talked last year yes brought market specific overall gpu card specifically cryptocurrency market captured gaming business captured oem business essentially see overall oem business differ also graphic really overall computation yes still selling overall card overall price increase seen cryptocurrency valuation within q4 people bought also moved buy regular gpus caused significant amount supply constraint moving also regular overall gpus could planning gaming mining together second question memory overclock type thing something specifically see remember still even perfect understanding pure miner gamer see merge necessarily overall data figure term overclocking overclocking something new something folk expert along term gaming use gpus overall inaudible choose best type clocking overall game sure also may possibly cryptocurrency sure question term process term product autonomous side sense think level 4 level 5 autonomous time line see automaker versus intermediate company better ready better placed today ready level 4 level 5 okay sure opportunity talk auto good opportunity drive px platform many different part px platform autonomous driving car important piece want people understand probably transform lot within year one earlier year people really started believe understand autonomous driving going probably take place without ai really really ai problem able process data around car nanosecond type order create path overall car function going key also interesting discussion regarding level 3 level 4 level 5 move term level 5 level 5 essentially say steering wheel brake pedal essentially driver want move way level 5 go serial processing say going get level 3 going add level 4 level 5 probably introduced pegasus platform within year pegasus platform focused primarily level 4 level 5 may level 5 confined type community area several block radius college campus downtown area area could actually map quite heavily could actually bring process market remove driver quite quickly functioning thinking q toshiya hari colette m. kressabout bringing level 5 need car drive san francisco new york probably necessary today rather thinking coming day additionally level 3 moving advancement level 2 overall safety feature certain scenario would able drive whether freeway driving whether parking lot park car et cetera also probably near term time likely see robotaxis certain community well level 3 may time already tesla car road today functioning overall platform announced continued work audi pilot term volvo well many different robotaxis term u.s .. also international term area asked discussion auto manufacturer thinking involved actually different type stage different approach term want address market really want part shuttle want part robotaxis others would continue similarly infotainment system creating end car autonomous driving point unique market versus people put car year start ﬂeet car talking transportation industry whole affecting transportation service see overall partnership uber think ﬂeet without driver affect term trucking overall hauling material across country think using ai scenario improve safety overall eﬃciency term market u.s. market tremendous amount work china overall car company also term european term significant amount ﬂeets focus term probably one largest transformation transportation seen last 100 year going take different start different finish based quickly move area colette wanted finish asking ability expand margin going forward done great job growing gross margin operating margin past several year personally think mix improvement alone would drive gross margin higher time expanding opex pretty fast rate think ability grow margin going forward yes company focused really value platform really underlying machine regarding overall profitability overall margin expansion interesting focus gross margin see cost platform term actual component reality value often tremendous amount work software engineer hardware engineer create full platform work overall opex work unified structure support multiple different platform together focus one thing inaudible enable whole combination allowed u grow top line gross margin people expand higher platform also allowing u think thoughtfully term investment q toshiya hari colette m. kress q toshiya hariin term opex right measure certainly overall margin overall operating profit reached probably close 3.5 billion profit year even fourth quarter expanded margin close 40 still tool front u go forward focusing higher end platform see fast go want make sure true initial excuse additional investment going required business think complexity platform going forward still make sure investing internally customer take advantage gpus using great thank much time colette thank taking time u today thank thank thanks much
