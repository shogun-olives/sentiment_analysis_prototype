good afternoon thank tim arcuri semiconductor semi equipment analyst ubs happy nvidia u next slot colette kress cfo going simona read safe harbor beforehand launch question thank tim hosting u reminder presentation contains looking statement investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business question answer question answer perfect thank simona colette going ask question sort grouping first gaming business talk data center want talk auto business category question well let start gaming guess first question obviously demand strong revenue 2x since launching ampere still growing based upon guidance question always get sustainable calendar maybe first sort colette m. kress q tim arcuritalk also importantly walk u growth driver business head next year yes great set question first thank much hosting u look forward speaking everybody able answer question nvidia think gaming business remember gaming business u beginning gaming growth continued evolve decade gaming broad entertainment sport inﬂuences many different type participant important piece adding ray tracing essentially game changer industry also seen large rise notebook notebook gaming type notebook inﬂuence thin light type configuration also allows great gaming allows gaming matter mobile take gaming experience additionally seen many additional type user gaming area seen creatives seen broadcaster see many different type student stem population focusing different configuration using ray trace card using also infrastructure gaming think going forward looking right holiday season front u think important closest u time excited continue provide gaming card market holiday western world well turn corner new calendar year early speculate term demand trend go forward next year believe demand strong believe right channel inventory lean believe still great opportunity front u continue upgrade gamers ampere architecture well ray tracing see decoupling gaming see additional type opportunity use card using geforce company whole take appropriate work continue procure supply right situation demand exceeds overall supply able grow quite well year quarter sequentially growing continue plan q4 believe better situation term supply look second half next year great thanks colette talk also crypto moment know diﬃcult question answer really know much bought miner sort feedback getting channel sort maybe give u anecdote feedback channel convinces crypto big factor make worry maybe maybe potential colette m. kress q tim arcuri colette m. kressminers ﬂashing old firmware onto rtx card still hear happening sort hard really determine widespread nvidia developed strategy nvidia developed strategy lite hash rate type card coupled cmp product crypto mining processor product help steer supply gaming card towards gamers also provide cmp processing card crypto miner correct diﬃcult u determine much maybe crypto mining low rash lite hash rate card work driver ready driver poster back may announced lite hash rate card beyond lite hash rate card also target ethereum ethereum popular card excuse crypto see using gpus heard report software partially improved performance lite hash rate card gpus able fully restore understand would effective hash rate strategy effective way reduce value card miner steer supply gamers diﬃcult miner buy ampere gpus large quantity cmp targeted large ethereum installation reason discussed seeing ethereum 2.0 government policy affected overall desire cmp continue watch overall carefully believe strategy successful best really produce geforce card overall gamers yes think maybe point think thing people often miss hear improve performance may lite hash card going get would going get way back full performance thanks guess maybe talk trajectory balance obviously look pricing channel still well msrp tell channel still tight point lot inventory talk sort trajectory sort see imbalance 2022 think getting enough supply want talk purchase commitment part obviously gaming probably huge piece least part talk demand imbalance sort see manifesting throughout year sure looked quarter trying make good understanding seeing channel level channel continue procure supply meet need ecosystem piece work think improve q tim arcuri colette m. kress q tim arcuri colette m. kressoverall supply think supply procure create overall card would want put channel also think card partner oems also integral term getting technical diﬃculty gamers take u working procuring inventory next couple quarter seen u also procuring longer term longer term year also seen snow enter agreement take u many year term capacity need believe ecosystem whole need better understanding think possibility future help build capacity work today wait finish holiday season see inventory channel looking holiday get back seeing feel able really get stabilization point supply demand thing monitoring colette thing rest u looking sort looking site looking secondary market pricing versus msrp team sort ascertain get balance looking mostly aic distributor working creating channel best manage part channel second hand card going case maybe particularly thing short supply opportunity potentially resale overall pricing see market something control control term price sell card aics oems market essentially defines channel market determines price see love bring back believe bringing really take providing reasonable amount supply market versus lien amount today guess colette last thing gaming move data center way determine much growth say introduce ampere much growth obviously revenue 2x way think much mix versus much pricing well providing geforce card market decade looking historically year term compounded growth rate seen factor increase term unit either upgrade and/or new gamers coming onboard purchase well increase average asp average asp reﬂection people buying stock buying higher end card consistently time important q tim arcuri colette m. kress q tim arcuri colette m. kressdrivers even today look time ampere consistently driven unit asp think sorry maybe one question gaming think recently gave u 20 base upgraded think sort think number mean least looked historically half base seems upgrade new generation card drew curve sort asymptote 50 range roughly fair b would kind light characterize 20 upgrade rate indicative hey like even halfway yet term upgrade opportunity announced believe looking installed base 25 installed base upgraded either ampere architecture participating ray tracing card look look strong growth ray tracing inﬂuenced installed base additionally also look opportunity front u still great opportunity nearly 75 still opportunity get ray tracing whether ampere future great milestone u keep focus really mean people looking benefit existing card installed base common installed base include multiple different architecture generation focused pascal focused turing focusing even ampere think upgrade opportunity installed base two generation architecture great power think upgrade continue build card meet overall demand think got thank let shift data center first want ask question networking talk core compute networking side obviously said demand exceeds supply sound like constraint worse networking side given substrate issue whatnot pretty consistent message others sound like maybe 550 million 600 million number networking data center segment last quarter question sort help u quantify much demand word several hundred million dollar short demand obviously also said demand still exceeds supply even january maybe help u quantify number maybe think start ship demand level yes within q3 networking demand much much stronger supply available q3 probably expect something similar q tim arcuri colette m. kressmove q4 company whole continues work supply situation hope improve second half next year nothing really different term networking focused many supply challenge necessarily one thing think complexity product think complexity ecosystem really work beginning builder way ecosystem end construction product getting market really focus whole company done tremendous job given strong demand improve situation believe really get strong position second half next year great maybe moving core compute growing 60 fiscal look like grow another 50 mean guiding fiscal core compute look pretty reasonable business grow 50 next year mean obviously ampere really hitting beginning product cycle similar question asked gaming way characterize much growth seeing compute side unit versus pricing get question lot frankly know really answer sure look data center business data center business broken primarily different type customer big part overall hyperscale growth hyperscale customer still represent 50 overall revenue today half selling enterprise oems and/or odms mean year expanded breadth depth term able sell hyperscale building internal workload workload needed term monetization data coming network focused ai acceleration also set cloud instance cloud instance really important area enterprise begin work moving workﬂows acceleration taking advantage ai really help business great momentum also inferencing remember several year ago still early stage inferencing ability provide platform card also a100 really dual allowing partake training inferencing inferencing important driver revenue likely outgrew data center revenue whole term growth seeing inferencing sale break whether price point unit think really tough way look supply overall customer different version want want full system want card want choose type system q tim arcuri colette m. kresscan enable every single one even provide cloud provide type hybrid world many different configuration probably easiest way discus business based asp unit continue focus trying data center scale type provider mean ability focus gpu acceleration overall acceleration data center whole incorporated work system also focusing three different component may whether cpu future gpu well current dpu field well got ask enterprise people talk cloud think people get driver cloud frankly see big seven hyperscalers look capex trend visible underlying growth trend enterprise well milestone availability software stack ai enterprise vmware partnership expansion launchpad dgx running whole stack talk maybe sort milestone enterprise think growth side keep cloud mix still roughly 50/50 sure enterprise strategy democratize ai make mainstream type workload order enabled nvidia ai enterprise software suite contains tool need develop deploy ai allows supported maintained way enterprise require enterprise really important software capability service capability continue run mainstream server run instead siloing type workload infrastructure also important part term work partnering vmware example help drive dpu adoption well data center increasingly becoming implement example zero trust security important part enterprise think deploying acceleration ai mission critical type job may also launched something referred launchpad nvidia ai want think try buy enterprise continuing serve different option ease adoption ease learning many different way whether infrastructure fully complete system software stack continue work application stitching together one way wanted start base piece infrastructure build go enable dgxs example base command development ai edge workload engage egx running deployed ai managed ﬂeet command many different type software offering tending q tim arcuri colette m. kress q tim arcuri colette m. kressbe oem system odm system cloud offering future believe think growth different type ai workload whether training whether inferencing whether edge computing great size enterprise important area focus already know 50 standalone know cloud participant also enterprise growth think term future enterprise would important part got thank want ask dpu timing mention bluefield know past said sam bluefield 2024 ultimately entire server tam mean get really big number taking server tam multiply 1,000 asp provided sort insight term think ultimate share sam might like right way even think sam take entire server tam multiplied 1,000 asp discussion dpu data center become important topic enterprise hyperscalers continue focus place stage data encrypt data environment safely already talking current availability bluefield also future generation continue improve many customer trial working qualify dpu term well future continue see important area data center whole probably see ramp term revenue next year got maybe last thing data center kind go auto jensen said last call whether really realistic server ship accelerator obviously still 10 think ultimately penetration get 100 guess question arm road map help get talk sort interplay accelerator side grace road map help kind get sure way want think discussion every server likely acceleration ai gpu believe believe long term data center driven one one many time multiple different type solution inside server multiple gpus many different type configuration support think opportunity front u right think still single digit term type penetration seeing type deployment many different q tim arcuri colette m. kressindustries looking ai solution readily available software get get believe continue able penetrate enterprise future work term hyperscales dug larger larger model new workload new workload focus conversational ai recommender type model well important thing well see term omniverse future great thank want ask omniverse want first talk auto obviously huge pipeline 8 billion pipeline said parked back half decade clear mean obviously mercedes partnership going start manifest probably would think 2024 certainly 2025 number partnership done well lot chinese well guess talk timing mercedes number one number two look market valuing vendor mean ada market putting high multiple vendor seems debate whether tier 1 want control software stack degree willing basically hand key also talk okay different question important area u working autonomous driving really led way helping folk understand complexity autonomous driving term compute needed solution ai really help deployment autonomous across lot different type vehicle discussed autonomous pipeline going forward 8 billion 2027 includes design win today across transportation industry think important understand many different type industry pipeline first established oems mercedes hyundai volvo several others also includes electric vehicle neighborhood electric vehicle type company nio xpeng li auto several others trucking also important area safety autonomous driving ca forget robotaxis robotaxi across world also included pipeline see start reﬂection revenue growth associated pipeline probably starting second half next year larger round maternal corner calendar year mercedes deal important part healthy part pipeline ability u sell hardware also participate software software monetization daimler split u think important deal know many people focused unique way work together oem share benefit kind deal excited working daimler many others across world full stack type solution hardware hardware q tim arcuri colette m. kress q tim arcuri colette m. kresswith system solution work anyone term want complete overall software daimler probably one stronger relationship quite long ﬂeet work working software many different supplier great thank mean seems orin start ramp ship calendar really going catalyst start open backlog would agree orin architecture expected start shipping 2022 calendar discussed orin architecture back coming live orin soc feature 17 billion different trend delivering probably 7x performance prior generation xavier orin support autonomous vehicle also embedded platform including robotics interest orin high design win comprise probably good amount autonomous design winning pipeline win based everything oems trucking robotics exciting term orin part term continuing development work build platform production look forward shipping next year got probably good question sort pivot question getting investor lot thing one piece mercedes partnership one piece effort move revenue recurring model vmware partnership directly licensing software obviously omniverse well high level sort outline strategy recurring revenue business model particularly gaming ai thank think software nvidia software new u talking probably 10 15 year onset building cuda really delivered probably inﬂuential software package folk necessarily separate monetization could development platform across gpus essential added significant amount software today may offer term separately offer separately monetize separately important enterprise important enterprise know application work service component something count term continued innovation support fuel work ai assist continue provide lot different software application overall stack infrastructure well focus key area monetize separately infrastructure whole across company whether q tim arcuri colette m. kress q tim arcuri colette m. kressgaming data center professional visualization still meaningful part revenue monetization addition software separately really helpful u year come still early day monetizing separately yes mean geforce part saw announcement ea would go couple month ago seemed like pretty big deal mean pretty simple math take several ten million user 10 month nominal number get pretty big number even given large company today talk well geforce another great opportunity providing optionality building cloud gaming geforce infrastructure inaudible service top working partner across world include type software package building infrastructure enable work many different provider assure yes get expand gaming many gamers great opportunity able reach gaming whether price point individual device gaming using different type package mag allow availability many pc type game geforce many different way procure make available gamers continue strategy try inﬂuence gamers world yes obviously part moving revenue current model vein talk omniverse bit talk omniverse bit guess sort laid three sort three monetization area three vertical attack guess first one talked clearly creatives engineering cad design people 40 million sort talked realizable opportunity also digital twin stuff also intelligent agent stuff avatar big tam well talk part success omniverse getting cae vendor board platform trying push standard talk see competitor customer see competitor kind talk evolution omniverse sure let start omniverse u omniverse hardware software platform nvidia able introduce 3d design collaboration building virtual world building digital twin building virtual world distributed collaboration investment across many different type company different level stand benefit case q tim arcuri colette m. kressfrom computing graphic technology infrastructure software whole working delivering solution help industry think tam think tam front u still early day term outlining correct lot different collaborative designer target 40 million designer think available 40 million designer working stitching together today collaborative productivity application moving 2d world 3d world could license example one user 1,000 user per year start building 3d environment one form monetization refer omniverse enterprise term purchasing seat per user per year general availability today additionally opportunity creating digital bot creating customer support call center car assistance large opportunity front u see improvement could also taking omniverse avatar example pricing approximately 1,000 per avatar per year also beta available soon software revenue one piece omniverse multiplier think system infrastructure chip revenue also necessary designer would likely need workstation order design work additionally building complex large model 3d virtual environment new data center level type infrastructure inﬂuence well building metaverses already started content creator cloud gaming infrastructure enterprise continue start work building digital twin well look tam opportunity building continue refine next couple month contribution software hardware talked relationship customer partner mean part success platform getting cae vendor board partnering cae capability guess piece view need necessarily ammo past feel like maybe need cae capability platform really successful least fruit 40 million engineering people yes look ability engage enterprise many different industry continue follow path done first thing working oems odms different type infrastructure built industry continue certified system q tim arcuri colette m. kress q tim arcuri colette m. kress q tim arcurithat support different industry might begun working financial institution need manufacturer retail list go omniverse yet another example important infrastructure connected partner ecosystem look current existing software application designer work connect software application omniverse taking exact work moving 3d overall path get enterprise understanding industry ecosystem software partner infrastructure program go market exactly incremental build software engagement partner guess also cloud customer want build metaverse mean different thing obviously also want build platform well view tension big cloud customer also trying omniverse approach accelerate computing ai solution always agnostic work everybody market assisting software application specific certain industry also help hyperscales may working certain framework certain large model stitch together make optimized eﬃcient example right 150 software development kit available market support support different type hardware provider may well whether cpu hardware provider storage memory important thing fine tuning think support beginning supporting world acceleration ai whatever put together yes thanks mentioned certainly cloud gaming issue much whether technology ready whether gaming interest put title cloud thing like sort behavioral thing seems like hurdle sort get anyway really really appreciate time thank much colette thank much hosting u appreciate thanks thanks
