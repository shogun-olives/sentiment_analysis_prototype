share business large scale others relatively small built within business unit area like healthcare may hear u talk building health business already large healthcare business across country pharmacy professional serving community every day way building top big base place building something much smaller core retail business growing top large retail business way think relativity based market trend thing like food consumables see unit share unit share growing faster dollar share good thing taken longer term view share scale business really important u yeah speaking share obviously dollar comp tell story said actual tonnage unit obviously picked lot momentum year may trailed behind little bit last year share perspective look today think gaining share back see playing going forward next several quarter look maybe go back really last year first shutdown happen march 2020 number thing solved top line obviously take care customer safety included closing store night many location 24 hour moved way 7 morning 8:30 restricted number entrance obviously wanting make sure compliant thing like social distancing closed service like optical tire really narrowed offer core grocery consumable business definitely slowed u customer time shopping karen short john furnerchannels probably many moving whatever closest home thing begun somewhat normalize think still lot work delta variant pandemic going continue prioritize safety customer service overall thing going format closer home seen sale increase second quarter first quarter look like momentum walmart picking said first couple quarter thing first quarter also closing second quarter inventory level 20 year ago plus single position going really important season great plan serve season underway got big holiday coming positioned well coming quarter able serve customer going back half year okay actually note price gap least seen never wider grocery comment guess question communicate value walmart price point relative competition guess grocery question seemingly value still become much important consumer given much stimulus dollar ﬂoating around yeah couple thing important first customer value proposition think price assortment experience trust 59 year 28 year part organization every little price price leadership always core know comment important expand offer adjacent service like healthcare financial service focus thing like walmart connect walmart plus wo ever lose focus core retail business core retail business successful relative value offer versus competition value come leverage thing like supply chain fixed cost care thing talked year wo change throughout last year maintained pricing level certainly saw number promotion stop around market maintained price position term costing inﬂation thing could happen u stay disciplined merchant broad range category interest portfolio merchant mix portfolio within department karen short john furner karen shortwe mix category within department building density local market delivery offering like announced couple week ago golocal thing small business community really make local close 5,000 community around country helpful maybe thinking inﬂation little bit obviously come every single conversation maybe see inﬂation today guess would ask cost relative retail inﬂation versus cost inﬂation know could maybe parse consumable perspective versus yeah sure easiest answer would share number trend seeing food consumables unit share growing faster dollar share think thing like dollar refer internally penny profit versus margin rate know p l see strength margin also includes income activity like walmart connect core retail margin want maintain price gap ensure customer value trust value basket good either shop walmart digitally buy basket grocery inside store supply chain pressure continue course dynamic chartering vessel securing container private ﬂeet inside country leverage shortage back something said beginning since march 2020 really focused building ﬂexibility able yeah ensuring use supply chain asset including store fulfillment center dynamically serve customer demand understand turn meet demand really depend walmart team lot capability term able optimize cost long time great thing ultimately supply chain cost tend ﬂow growing volume base advantage give back customer ability leverage fixed cost create room p l reinvest customer proposition okay guess thinking guess broadly inventory promotional environment holiday season guess ask partly perspective probably still shortage supply side maybe kind john furner karen short john furnerof lead think promotional environment much muted even extended period time even possibly thought yeah sure ca speak retailer decided late last year early year quite obvious consumer balance sheet strong point assumed would remain strong time really took step back early year decided would take term purchasing call open buy merchant position u well late first quarter second quarter beyond took aggressive stance inventory led closing second quarter inventory level 20 throughout first two quarter significant presence walmart rollback program store online continue maintain kind promotional activity said earlier one thing used buyer merchant still today get cost inﬂation coming actually mitigate taking price higher margin item rollback mix within category think important u relative value gap position mentioned food proud work hard every day want meeting relative value gap situation whether customer budget sensitive time sensitive trust get value transacting walmart okay came prior meeting think asked many time know provide kind thinking com profitability broadly obviously analyst day february 2020 indicated loss dollar think margin basis peaked obviously saw massive acceleration would helped profitability kind frame thinking specifically within p l yeah sure really thinking business total july 2020 four month talked new york merged two business together team source team come together changed really thinking measure thing internally externally term channel business customer business led work customer value proposition ultimately trying understand intent situation whether physical digital karen short john furnerthen reason lead clarity reporting two channel line become really blurred point give example morning ordered express order 8:36 walmart app 9:20 run heard dog barking order arrived included item store part order place also going come fulfillment center part tomorrow another piece look like going next day signal even though order app fulfilled partially store fulfillment center lot value spending lot time trying break internally looking total profitability important thing next year balance profitability coming margin retail item p l like walmart connect data monetization marketplace number opportunity really mix well together ultimately trying make sure understand customer intent could match catalog intent okay actually note change guess app consolidation happened talk little bit still come already accomplished still come app perspective consolidation perspective glad asked couple year ago two apps called one orange app orange represented grocery shopping app called blue app blue walmart ecommerce business worked well served purpose time create friction customer analogy would compare went way

basket transact one time supply chain team background optimize best way give customer meet customer promise come really excited say customer experience customer deserves able anything need walmart figure film background always say internally never want show customer old chart blue app orange app pretty clearly showed orange chart dealing want take visibility away customer anything need u okay thinking guess core customer realize mirror kind top general population would argue core customer probably going ﬂushed cash get 2022 would argue put walmart good position know mostly would say core customer tend save much maybe higher income demographic would think state consumer get end year next year like stimulus comparison perspective also child tax credit maybe could snap well change coming along pipeline october 1 yeah think general said earlier overall balance sheet strong amongst customer across country way think customer maybe core income bracket high back workforce next month real income big benefit shopping addition stimulus think ready ﬂexible direction price gap mentioned earlier could even important time going timeframe maintained throughout last couple year thinking entire time pandemic want anything would ever erode customer trust taken year build trust business many team team trust always top mind karen short john furner karen short john furner karen shortand probably throughout pandemic prioritized safety serving community managing result needed building future think team nice job balancing always focused trust safety beginning think specifically snap know
