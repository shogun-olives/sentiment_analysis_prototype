feature mean cloud run one best oriented container runtimes addition gke also another question one coming sachin glad ready vladimir ph asking u benefit anthos edge versus anthos vmware know even different guess start think question could vmware edge think distributed cloud edge guess kind help demystify richard seroter sachin gupta richard seroter sachin gupta richard seroterif think question feel little bit similar previous question actually trying actually trying modernize anthos environment provide simple management plane built kubernetes run containerized application also run vms path modernization looking looking operational cost reduction simplification want sort new world containerized world win going option run similar perhaps solution may software layer package hardware software completely together google distributed cloud built anthos come together real question looking modernize pure legacy environment going remain looking modernize need ï¬‚exibility vms well anthos anthos vms perfect yes vmware footprint edge already obviously run right top everything amazing like ï¬‚exibility work look want run vmware footprint inside google cloud region google cloud vmware engine support ï¬‚exible based customer trying achieve yes awesome another one sachin one think interesting thought anthos already whether talking cloud api already new api yes anthos look year right cloud api really instead bring cluster gke cluster control plane well every single cloud run control plane google cloud manage cluster may sitting aws azure somewhere else simple way control plane simplifying deploy cluster manage bringing power gke anthos together yes love demo showing single command someone today could deploy anthos aws first stand management cluster user cluster hard simplify take responsibility look like think really simplification story awesome sachin gupta richard seroter sachin guptathis one somehow awesome choose gke autopilot cloud run look autopilot amazing feel like serverless kubernetes right kind magic behaves still kubernetes cover goofy extra extension stuff gke cloud run also kind serverless environment look difference two really extent want

want hear tell u joining see check marco sure enough see everybody excited interact talk today still hanging next event website click blue button say interactive experience activate feature okay let get going cover three thing one entire workforce securely access legacy modern application without exposing network attack two get better protection threat data loss right within browser three gain visibility unsafe activity even user corporate network device going beyondcorp enterprise beyondcorp enterprise bce call google cloud zero trust access solution bce use chrome access apps resource background google network protects proxy traï¬ƒc enforcing access policy policy use factor identity device info location signal authorize access apps data need job awesome marco let get good stuff think easy developer work remotely securely right know tough task know making life easy developer also protecting code critical new beyondcorp enterprise feature client connector important enables zero trust access legacy thick client application yes think lot people run today let take look developer would use set laptop cymbal group way fictional company cymbal around since 1970s modernized application sound familiar one main developer application still hosted private data center see quite bit recently cymbal developer way access application remotely without vpn security team constant concern remote user could expose network even worse source code attack hacker using beyondcorp enterprise client connector access apps without vpn let show cymbal tanisha rai marco genovese tanisha rai marco genovesedevelopers would connect via ssh git repository show let say blink might miss simple let go ahead swing developer machine simply open google chrome google chrome actually loaded see authenticated mykit application repository already corner simply click endpoint verification extension click start connection endpoint postured background secured connection made gitlab simply turned green course minimize browser left hand side going go ahead open terminal application thick client application going go ahead run git clone actually going pull code git local machine application pulled locally onto endpoint know probably seemed pretty straightforward might noticed first client browser probably already opened second background continuously validating identity device bunch factor identity proxy third tcp proxy seamlessly securely forward traï¬ƒc fact developer around world remotely simply securely without hassle vpn pretty awesome beyondcorp enterprise worker allowed access application permitted use prevent unwanted lateral movement across network audience want know would use method remote access organization awesome let see workforce securely access modern web application even device let look cymbal extended workforce call center contractor meet rhonda one thousand remote contractor help cymbal 24/7 support holiday shopping season security community share chat past year onboarded new temporary worker send laptop make install software could secure look like would yes contractor also tend vulnerable attack last year 44 organization experienced breach 74 breach result giving much privileged access third party cymbal keeping user corporate network decrease risk exposed attack like ransomware using beyondcorp enterprise come cymbal contractor employee tanisha rai marco genovese tanisha rai marco genovese tanisha raiable byod onboard quickly use device feel comfortable bce layer protection keep secure way rhonda secure access device clear separation work personal activity let show exactly see begin day first navigates google chrome browser navigates cymbal call center application enter credential authentication time security key passed authentication cymbal call center application saw rhonda log chrome cymbal credential call beyondcorp protected profile extends threat data protection soon log see agentless approach mean additional software get right work device rather picking laptop waiting hour everything get configured therefore saving time money awesome tanisha thing zero trust access automatically trust rhonda login credential authorization continuous first log beyondcorp enterprise enforces cymbal contractor access policy based identity contextual information device location well fact authenticated titan key security community want know use authentication sm code security key maybe authentication app maybe something else completely hopefully nothing security key every day especially since always phone yes easy use provide strongest protection phishing regardless use form authentication critical basic security hygiene highly recommend especially remote access let take look know anybody anything look like people use let say security key b awesome love hear let get back rhonda authenticated app explore integrate threat data protection right within browser great let see get work show bce protect cymbal customer rhonda ease really busy day enough time finish processing batch customer refund next call want save marco genovese tanisha rai marco genovesethe customer credit card information local file refund thing slow saving sensitive information another location cymbal security policy let show experience let navigate credit card file let download rhonda refund another time see blocked see message appear bottom prevents yes exactly actually see credit card pdf sensitive dangerous content inside show policy configured cymbal detect risky behavior like let go ahead look administrative console admin.google.com left hand side see security menu scroll underneath security actually see data protection going go ahead authenticate obviously administrator securely let go type password authenticated able go ahead look data protection policy notice say managed rule going go ahead drill managed rule actually see credit card detection policy ron hitting right also got detector thing like social security even detecting code copied pasted shared developer admin decide want automatically block user action cymbal done want trigger warning user instead addition thing like credit card number also set specific dlp policy detect file type source code way protect sensitive information code monitoring controlling even blocking people upload download exactly use granular policy type information order protect exfiltration showed type data protection policy set also customize access policy change take effect real time really big deal get continuous checking whether user policy giving second security control fact let make update real time rhonda okay community going ask policy change location maybe operating system policy whether corporate owned device please chime really love understand hear guy deem important wait result come say see kind thing time customer want able dynamically change policy depending circumstance particular customer really tanisha rai marco genoveseinterested controlling location perhaps limiting access certain country additionally company going org change maybe merger able change access policy select group user department real time crucial beyond three choice poll many way customize access policy based organization need let go ahead look back poll look like corporate owned device awesome love thanks everybody contributing let go ahead right going go ahead jump gcp cloud console see proxy actually see cymbal gitlab developer application also see call center application application could anywhere demo gcp going go ahead select call center application bottom see rhonda right hand side application access policy let go ahead edit going go ahead remove existing access policy allowing access europe u.s. going go ahead delete one going add new rule simply going go ahead select cloud iap iap web app user going go ahead select access policy everybody chose required corporate device right okay want make sure remember correctly let go ahead save place click save save policy actually going propagated across world within short period time proxy across google global network immediately updated next time user try access protected resource evaluated new policy set mentioned continuous authorization earlier key part authorization occurrence even begin new session mean perpetual access exactly company like cymbal employ hourly temp worker ability dynamically update access condition important instance could set policy worker access application resource shift hour working day allow access specific geography also may want require device operating system security patch important condition manage especially contractor using device exactly rhonda meet condition updated longer able access call center application think faced one frustrating thing remote access especially using vpn think access something reason working tanisha rai marco genovese tanisha rai marco genoveseit worse let see change worked rhonda try open new task call center application let take look see let navigate back home denied access result change marco bce rhonda covered report error using new feature beyondcorp enterprise policy troubleshooter informs end user blocked tell get help quickly see would follow prompt email admin get help let go ahead email admin admin notified u blocked beyondcorp enterprise policy troubleshooter admins quickly fix issue blocking user keeping productive yes bet let show cymbal admin would see side request unblock user like rhonda going go ahead switch gear let go gmail another google application look like got notification credit card detection good know ron taking interesting action within endpoint oh look like got email rhonda actually blocked application link sent let go ahead click automatically logged directly google cloud platform actually see different policy binding place let go ahead select call center application right hand side actually see granted condition denial let go ahead look binding detail interestingly see rhonda failed meet listed access level sure enough requiring corporate device granted normally go back block updating policy access level evaluated like contractor going keep moving interest time sound good easy way yes super easy let look bce give u better visibility unsafe user activity whether unsuccessful access attempt like saw anomalous activity across apps bce protects let put security dashboard chrome give look going jump back google admin console security menu left hand side actually click dashboard wait load second something make note chrome data protection actually going get whole slew different information see chrome user see individual dlp incident want scroll little bit could actually see many user forgetting password figure use track pad see user login attempt see example message encrypted tanisha rai marco genovese tanisha rai marco genovese tanisha rai iman ghanizada sri subramanianinterested whether credit card number making let go ahead drill little bit one report see every single file uploaded file downloaded web content upload example actually see every single time took place social security detection well credit card detection actually drill credit card detection think really cool going show everybody real quick since like another minute sensitive data transfer taking place block detected otherwise even organization using device still monitor security event investigate alert awesome marco audience think let u know chat definitely know something interest last 15 minute seen entire workforce access modern legacy application securely improve threat data protection get better visibility risky activity even unmanaged device yes call right end day beyondcorp enterprise make
