combination key graphic understanding taking graphic capability gaming leveraging within center console well future digital cluster see many midrange car unique offering offering best type graphic pretty much removing dial button part term car go forward also focus center compute overall car go forward hearing autonomous driving go forward autonomous driving self driving car underlying compute essentially data center problem similar problem face already today many key industry putting together ability train overall computer recognize thing outside car process information coming camera sensor lidar radar central computer serve need self driving car key focus four market lot going maybe starting pc market gaming talked growth rate broke gaming versus oem analyst day updated several quarter since good picture growth rate talk really driving talk right growth rate colette kress blayne curtis colette kressand interesting computex go ptams struggling half business gaming laptop well big laptop part overall gaming pie today think people would traditionally think graphic card maybe gamers developed last couple year yes let break think overall gaming result gaming market adding card market see today people necessarily purchasing pc take part overall gaming pc updating experience gaming producing better gpu game want play fueling good percentage overall growth highlighted key interesting piece also notebook gamers want game everywhere want pc take friend mobile space need solid gpu experience oem manufacturer working u also model truly gaming marketed gaming population growing quite well several quarter past nearly doubling size business still coming small base see focus much interest regarding notebook got way go keep overall size adding card market term data center excuse gamers piece type device gaming going going make sure focused whether tablet key device well well streaming part cloud going see term overall gaming result look discrete card market driving customer buy next generation powerful talk whether moving term directx upgrade physic processor lot going term gaming look like movie almost term production value right way think cadence upgrade changed think surrounded overall industry surrounded see full ecosystem around gaming platform blayne curtis colette kresscontinued evolve production value game work continuous software developer game make realistic gamer receives go purchase card experience come life minute plug minute open back computer start overall game continue relationship underlying gamer providing new driver new upgrade new game coming also good understanding type game inﬂuence improve experience exact game better gpu set call gameworks key design focused harder part graphic whether fire hair smoke water key thing see game really come life work done exclusively game developer put place thing inﬂuence gamers continue come back platform allow u continue leadership share overall gaming market rate upgrade little hard determine sure absolutely enthusiast type gamers coming back every single time put new architecture new platform still little bit early see fast movement term refresh cycle tremendous success current architecture want ask necessarily application broader gaming vr almost gaming experience feel going ce three four year much look maybe drone vr actually going something else focus still early day curious thought play getting gaming base upgrade capability yes good question think next exciting evolution pc gaming absolutely virtual reality forefront term new game new device enable vr experience virtual reality becoming experience based underlying technology great experience really solving really hard problem latency order put encapsulated position great experience key blayne curtis colette kress blayne curtisnow many different type form vr probably see coming 2016 key one concentrated would needing set glass pc pc enables keyframe rate necessary great overall position work oculus well also htc recommendation coming regarding type pc would best enable hardware coming probably one top three gpus currently sell overall retail value price great opportunity u probably assured already started movement getting excitement upcoming release 2016 great opportunity u upsell refresh obviously hard forecast big market could trajectory going put spot term requirement generation obviously going future generation probably even ante term installed base today going buy oculus rift much installed base could actually even support today obviously rough term yes think upgrading installed base key part focus strong growth rate today still way go term upgrading installed base something see correct ca make prediction next year many unit kind upgrade see think early tell term supply available beginning think continuous content vr improving vr experience go forward even capability moving beyond gaming see many use case prototyping different scenario enterprise well look forward still little bit early tell term big get want change gear obviously lot talk auto probably easier handicap know win know big platform could maybe timing could move around today bulk revenue console dash application obviously interest autonomous application talk think ramp colette kress blayne curtis colette kressof win talk maybe competitively see opportunity gain share sure currently business automotive right 80 million quarter also risen 80 growth last year average continue see growth platform 8 million car road today infotainment system backed nvidia probably pipeline 25 million car need hit road safe say yes see growth exactly quarter quarter perfect crystal ball term yes strong growth automotive business count think work term autonomous driving platform seeded platform 50 different oem manufacturer researcher startup around world interest quite high platform central compute autonomous driving hear u talk automotive ce outside virtual reality also great presentation talk next step term automotive term seeded development platform continue work probably see next development service individual provider look console business business tesla put big screen lot people chased look performance requirement talking driving digital dash seems go car seems make sense talk 8 million going 25 million based business say 8 million quarter still see suﬃcient growth longer horizon start layer autonomous driving yes think continue evolve position really best end graphic necessary digital cluster go forward frankfurt international car show next piece essentially virtual dashboard button nothing key company demonstrating see future concept car continue stay part overall graphic able benefit right think additional car blayne curtis colette kress blayne curtis colette kressdesign win landing really luxury line really car able take platform move many mainstream benefiting maybe even keeping competition know key selling point overall technology within car digital display well received see u go model expands well probably next gen infotainment system going forward xonex stage many semi company pursuing ada driver assisted one real growing area semi many solution would programmable term gpu base versus maybe pld even assp maybe could see mobileye fixed algorithm could talk also different type google plus driving car may major oem deploys still lot moving piece term correct self driving assisted driving think dan talked one platform turn 45 mile hour obviously illegal notification well gpu fit going early stage move volume think maybe move fixed solution see oems actually dynamically changing learning would benefit yes think correct assume lot different semiconductor company inside car probably 50 different microprocessor whether single function two function type service thing going lot focus ada focus center compute different type need technology assist ada really talking underlying supercomputer inside car necessarily focused single function focused eliminating also going necessary car blayne curtis colette kress blayne curtisour strategy really providing underlying platform thing coexist remove driver replace driver supercomputer would key point think different angle many peer seen approach really focused overall platform want ask talked growth business mentioned data center workstation business also directed obviously muted year everybody year talk maybe business ﬂat respectively look next year type visibility returning parity yes enterprise business focused pro visualization recall first part calendar year quite bit volatility term macro condition particularly around fx rate inﬂuenced term lot channel overall thought term pricing worldwide saw many different change term would purchase overall capital needed refresh expand take growth overall business saw first part year seen lot stabilization fx rate necessarily change stabilization produce little bit better result thought q3 well stay focused still question term get back term growth ca make prediction right going forward next year generally look one quarter see ﬂattish little bit stay focused data center business strong pipeline lot key area seen result year ago early year inﬂuenced large project large project next new large project next year get little bit lumpy term look confident data center business continue add term strong growth go forward large project probably produced little bit lumpiness right colette kress blayne curtis colette kress blayne curtisi want ask gross margin look next year lot moving piece well pc oem drag small gaming growing deliver good gross margin talk moving piece maybe auto volume could mean lower margin think adding lot value time could accretive well talk moving piece yes talked four market refer four growth market strategic market go forward far year date fiscal year 2016 overall revenue growth approximately 5 far look growth market growing 25 far year date even though overall company growing 5 still piece pc oem business tegra oem business become based necessarily aspect seen particularly growing correct become relatively small part business last quarter represented le 10 business continue watch continue compete business right economics pc oem see u concentrate four key market think tremendous tam opportunity front u also great leadership position four different one ca make prediction term next year really look one quarter great tam exciting market whether artificial intelligence virtual reality autonomous driving many three key disruptive market see talked underlying platform able enable three last question asking everybody actually see disruptive trend think answered look next year actually involved many disruptive trend correct q unidentified participant colette kress q blayne curtis colette kress q unidentified participant colette kress q blayne curtisi want leave little time question audience couple minute anybody question answer think accelerated headset accelerated gpu addition pc gaming console whatever device would okay hear first part would put gpu headset physically know still early term solve vr overall performance better actually glass right near future see glass overall pc probably key focus sure continue improve overall technology vr becomes desire gamers wanted ask like two supercomputer car take supercomputer get stronger time year personally feel need one one time two powerful chip car okay think referencing platform put together drive px actually enables two overall socs incorporated right question two enough actually get need even given functionality need occur parallel processing dual support within car need possible fail capability performance actually may get stronger one two could multiple term underlying computer generates self driving car removing human car pretty big task amount compute capability human year year driving think look hard amount thing replicate necessarily replicated one simple little microprocessor significant supercomputer probably necessary colette kressthe clock say zero appreciate time colette great thank
