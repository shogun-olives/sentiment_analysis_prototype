lot focus thank goodness amazing tool help u partnership conversation continually focus partner making sure lined success motion corey sale team applied learning expertise successfully realm digital transformation become enormous topic inaudible strategic deal seen walmart seen seen kroger seen others earnings call heard satya actually called two year digital transformation happened past two month taken many question mean walk u mean customer perspective investor think statement also wanted ask topic inning digital transformation u global pandemic impacting deployment large budget discussion sorry four question one four question let go yeah first question around sort data transformation past two month one thing important step digital transformation sort passion energy excitement top company making shift either deciding going become much remote workforce going leverage based solution also opportunity productivity improvement automation able take digital service manufacturing plant using iot able smarter approach thing running many year whether need repair big set digital transformation push leadership right thing need think progress seeing typically hard conversation take work typically cost involved sort think workforce need change get think shift seen lot conversation dramatically accelerate suddenly become goodness right new world either financial perspective remote perspective need happen immediately right think shift really sort paved way accelerated conversation also accelerated customer already underway right already sort seeing go said need move little bit faster actually think sort mean sort thinking especially world sort multiple phase challenge recovery going see lot digital transformation obvious business continuity seeing sort uptake sort experience service solution obvious one team seen sort huge spike window virtual desktop seen huge spike perhaps le obvious one solution curbside pickup kind interesting one remote assist used hololens sort support people factory repair thing without someone looking shoulder remote safe location even thing like remote sale really picked obvious reason people still need make sale able take advantage next sort wave certainly see hybrid period recovery part remote part back oﬃce sort enabling solution automation real exciting place seeing sort energy around digital transformation sort really accelerate sort structural change thing already mentioned automated factory smart building able understand oﬃce able fraud detection able take solution got digital twin really apply change going happen overnight right much would love happen two month going take work go deliver going back maybe think covered everything except last question sort stage sort impacted deployment discussion stage early stage think sort important point think sort customer deciding want clearly sort early stage promotion think huge amount opportunity going continue see growth around q mark murphy corey sandersand conversation think seen lot give take come deployment large budget discussion energy sometimes desire give whole lot upfront money part may strong enable growth opportunity perhaps reducing

said something along line god need immediately know satya talked concept remote everything earnings call walk u going mean customer perspective looking term horizon yeah absolutely place seen immediate impact remote everything certain obvious one team sort usage team sort realization must set type environment able continue either teamwork learning sort obvious one actually window virtual desktop sort fast exciting growth area similar reason need able work secure remote way security also really important concept part remote everything necessarily elicit concept something remote lot structure security solution like azure active directory conditional access enables work remote way still secure based whatever policy principle think big one really twitch excuse solution one fundamental change way folk work think best example maybe sort digital sale customer service able sale motion fully remote definitely challenging folk think new experience able tool solution similar customer service right sort many case expectation people point limitation make harder service like remote assist become much easier leverage one interesting thing say seeing interest customer taking

interested topic want ask well spend consolidation potential recession look back think microsoft played offense extremely well economic expansion view eventually point budget come pressure recession maybe customer trying reassess value getting alternative using think microsoft going convey higher roi kind cohesive architecture versus point ph product thinking market could span everything collaboration communication security file sharing area think behave economic period absolutely yeah common conversation customer sure understand appreciate really tco conversation think going set interesting impact different place business certainly m365 microsoft 365 actually great tco conversation around typically vendor consolidation discussion right able say seven different security solution three different compliance solution customer think met customer said 43 distinct security solution using shocked could keep track opportunity take subset solution consolidate leverage sort single solution single price tco really quite powerful common conversation across board certainly opportunity u similarly team right certainly team really expansive platform chat collaboration meeting voice application hosting platform becomes opportunity consolidation right instead one platform really good meeting one platform really good q mark murphy corey sander q mark murphy corey sander q mark murphycollaboration chat one maybe application platform suddenly bring together think really type solution think azure going interesting one think azure also really valuable tco conversation think actually sort negative impact actually revenue transparently think going see customer opportunity able reduce spend actually passionate helping built checklist seller go say way got customer reduce spend removing workload rightsizing vms making sure using right size paying right price making sure scaling versus static usage like used using cost saving option reserved instance actually making sure seller pushing sort much cheaper ability buy computer pas service area think actually really powerful tco conversation customer think headwind u transparently opportunity build trust sort prove value prop much precisely customer think tco okay would right thing customer relationship part going helping get eﬃcient use area including actual azure inaudible usage fair way think ph right think place vendor consolidation single product give cost saving think way helping even product usage reducing way using get think right yeah okay corey want come right back team interested okay wanted ask well going back last earnings call amy commented seeing weakness smb market wondering think trend digital transformation spend discussion ask corey sander q mark murphy corey sandersyou think going play customer segment environment yeah one biggest partitioning looked sort impact actually industry right think actually industry segmentation shown lot distinction sort impact playing sort leveraging little bit gartner list sort impact caveat education think high impact education actually positive growth area u think opportunity even look industry across enterprise smb going see challenge think existing workload see cost reduction effort looked may see slowdown new workload think going impact think smb likely going see higher amount impact nature business little bit le fungible sort little bit le expendable cash et cetera think see industry slice happen think see impact greater smaller business lot obvious reason course countered fact actually seeing massive amount growth area right interesting retail kind interesting one seen massive growth retail place established online presence obvious reason struggling online presence seen le usage little bit even give take within industry good amount industry seen healthy growth public sector education retail et cetera think helping way helping driving growth enterprise smb alike helpful logical obviously one quite global scale reach microsoft look across slice mention wanted come back team went back looked quote actually recent survey work let want read two team basically zoom slack together make argument zoom

bringing component together unique hard competitor emulate whether bringing phone ph audio conferencing chat collab et cetera one thing well like yell screen described love able attack people angle including inaudible exactly multitasking powerful thing exactly q mark murphy corey sander q mark murphy corey sander corey quick competing product partial overlap team recently suffered scaling issue security issue wondering benefit microsoft publicity right try highlight differentiated architecture team think big opportunity team addition sort point mentioned full connection security think unique opportunity think customer really looking think folk work remote also realize endpoint exposed potential statutory risk think team offer opportunity team offer customer look team come back say hey like buy security solution top make sure enabling type protection think benefited consideration customer look think outside competitor challenge competitor may area really important topic discussion customer working remote endpoint may frequent endpoint common endpoint le control helping secure whether identity sort endpoint protection security solution analysis absolutely ongoing conversation okay couple question coming q want get trying get 5 minute let kind finish team discussion help u understand maybe team play broader strategy around microsoft 365 sitting looking exponential usage increase team help u think translates financially yeah place think going see opportunity certainly part m365 conversation right sort got integration oﬃce 365 even within component within team component upsell opportunity adding telephony adding voice type solution actually upsell revenue opportunity baseline consumption already talked little bit security opportunity also upsell opportunity taking baseline usage team able add whether azure active security solution whether q mark murphy corey security solution connecting team even sort integration security solution part team able secure document moving around leveraging collaboration environment upsell opportunity look sort m365 suite team part actually part parcel business sort third one kind one exciting one platform conversation able take team build platform solution top using power apps power automate creates licensing opportunity solution well customer use get excited get band ph seat well quite sort taking base usage expanding customer excited buy expand continue use solution corey extremely helpful wanted come back touch azure involved instrumental beginning heard comment made moment ago could impact think

even slowly begin reopen return oﬃce yeah absolutely mean think seen continue see lot customer excitement growth come business continuity requirement requirement look run big range thing whether run supporting application running team window virtual desktop seen large growth solution even need leverage fungible infrastructure data center may accessible may able go make change want go make expand data center need sort fungible agile usage certainly quite bit deployment remote work based deployment continues see continue structural perspective think actually continue forever right aspect people learned remote work possible learned done work set think see good amount continue whether application support remote work even window virtual desktop think continue see desire disaster recovery solution ready go case need use public cloud think also net new application built scaled whether sort new solution bot spun q mark murphy corey sandersrespond need thing like telemedicine education sign pointing continuing used continuing change see many month frankly interesting time sort mentioned got big reduction tco big opportunity customer save money coupled spike demand expectation cloud becomes hybrid extension data center lot give take seeing across azure business think describing try look product perspective drill within azure anything starting bubble within azure would say know might want pay attention potential become much larger topic maybe year road mean corey know azure sentinel azure stack azure cosmos db azure edge zone azure arc azure active directory obviously big one think hone yeah great good list service mentioned think probably say area one hybrid talking hybrid lot certainly think think digital transformation hybrid opportunity especially come solution think see lot energy regard would combine even mentioned azure arc offering sort single control plane managing environment cloud azure stack hub able deploy sort hybrid environment able support solution azure stack edge well kind bringing piece three together think lot digital transformation mentioned already manufacturing sort reworking manufacturing plan thinking iot analytics going component fuel enable sort disconnected experience still enabling cloud experience whether get manufacturing remote site energy retail location going think pretty exciting big part digital transformation story couple last one sometimes get really caught talk azure azure sentinel mentioned azure sentinel absolutely think something much customer energy around think m365 usage security bridge azure single analytics security analytics platform two sentinel become really positive environment couple mention github sort remote development really picked github really exciting part collaborative development even remote especially layering security q mark murphy corey sander q mark murphy corey sander q mark murphy corey sanderssolutions think going hot one synapse analytics platform also going really exciting one drive outcome corey took eye clock two minute let see maybe give u one liner know multiple speaker audience yes challenge ph power apps biz one key even faster growth discovery applicability broad range use case environment discovery process accelerated new code apps inaudible yeah one answer question yes yeah absolutely think actually seen really interesting power apps platform really powerful oftentimes need first one two get idea right need sort like example app going go build actually launched part response covid crisis response app launched sort healthcare support application tracking supply like said sort working going back work application template solving customer problem enabling people understand discover sort called question art possible possible power apps stuck template start saying wow let look six thing think scenario template becoming really quite powerful deliver excellent well done corey final maybe one minute looking back discussion around sale digital transformation think see next couple year term microsoft customer dialogue motion evolution customer relationship way sum term looking yeah mean think exciting thing team may perspective opportunity sell enable customer across solution area think example gave even today able q mark murphy corey sander q mark murphyoffer remote assist hololens azure analytics able bring component together thing get really excited one super unique two customer problem want solution want product help people enable solution crossing team platform azure crossing dynamic power automate component coming together way think never seen super excited fuel think going drive lot growth lot unique opportunity customer next year two corey hear energy enthusiasm come across ph clearly infectious want thank much taking time u j.p. morgan tmc conference letting u home location new jersey thank much looking forward next time thank much blast come back
