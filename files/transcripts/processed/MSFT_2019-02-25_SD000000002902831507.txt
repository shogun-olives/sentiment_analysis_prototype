business true whether person listening web right way dave thank joining u maybe benefit everyone room give u little bit introduction sort role microsoft purview little bit sort history tenure microsoft sure thanks cfo commercial business microsoft commercial business people familiar role working field term field finance expand field footprint well scott guthrie c ai side harry shum ai side question answer david m. q keith wei david m. q keith weissgot maybe like get product division one thing dave talked fundamental behind research lot primary work lot survey work one thing got excited microsoft part 1 trillion cio survey past couple year really starting three year ago saw real turn way cio seeing microsoft went legacy tech something people increasingly looking invest looking increase wallet share microsoft budget think happened past 3 four year really changed perception among cio microsoft vendor want push dollar well one think understand big focus enterprise thing enterprise looking provide great security trusted provider think breadth software interested look microsoft shop one thing hear lot customer `` want solution want person go think microsoft represents closest going get see think really started seeing pickup cloud came hybrid strategy thought customer big microsoft footprint plus also want move cloud want time frame want way work best help came hybrid strategy cloud mix timeline think really resonated lot customer got hybrid strategy pretty differentiated big cloud vendor like amazon google cloud ... yes think something microsoft uniquely others ca make offer company partnering together trying come sort hybrid strategy feel like literally lot footprint lot cloud footprint help make smoother transition uniquely microsoft value proposition got dive hybrid side equation want start azure azure probably part portfolio get question fundamental question people trying understand durability growth azure long could really impressive growth rate continue beginning use really big scale term big business talk u think growth trajectory azure david m. q keith wei david m. key customer driver point driving customer demand platform sure start meta level every decision make generally start think total adjustable market every year total addressable market cloud get bigger remember first started certain number year keep growing number perspective total addressable cloud market going continue grow foreseeable future look opportunity say every year get little bigger every year seem able expand footprint feel good lot runway cloud starter one message really resonating first heard lot customer say `` go cloud go cloud well past every customer need cloud strategy saying `` think cloud workload move basic thing like storage compute trying get aligned think cloud much deeper see much interested thing like security em offering see interested think ai think iot much advanced think safe say really selling encouraging folk move cloud way pulling u lot innovative idea even see lot disruption industry think newer company coming disrupting old player older player see coming u saying `` help develop cloud strategy help get modern current think sort know go far say limitless lot runway one thing cloud selling offering sold per seat effectively limit number people world sort lack better word cap sort per seat offering cloud offering literally cap take workload want move cloud think really hard anybody say big going get confident going get bigger got dig little bit term workload running azure right kind visibility could give u net new workload people building natively onto azure people moving workload public cloud environment azure environment kind visibility could give u people azure environment yes would divide couple huge category one migration migration existing workload cloud see lot people storage compute even heavier biz apps moving cloud lot stuff run eﬃciently cloud get scale see lot q keith wei david m. q keith wei david m. work going also see lot innovation work migration innovation database big thing cosmos db offering sql database offering pretty popular lot time people want migrate get going start innovating increasingly seeing folk saying `` wait minute going move stuff cloud great opportunity optimize let optimize migrate time innovate 2 major category see got customer going migrate existing workload public cloud environment using compute using storage still see additional solution around workload tend cap compute storage definitely see lot one thing finding even sale environment transform field need able create arc story say `` ought think moving cloud company really want know `` give sense end game moving workload trying save money like `` really trying accomplish really trying get work `` different way could transform business could work cloud could connected would get better data could use data serve customer better need holistic story need know going think get better sense going easier say `` okay get roadmap start moving stuff end state mind u really important able tell story paint vision end state could said think sort interesting lot u educating selling oftentimes customer pulling u forward saying `` hi try much innovative think look like lot guy side fence thinking sort transition public cloud maybe oversimplifying look lot sort percentage workload run different environment percentage people running environment percentage people running sort public cloud environment judge growth kind net new workload growth plus migration public cloud sound like like third vector got thinking workload get additional monetization workload public cloud sort migrated functionality vector thinking q keith wei david m. q keith weissyes think even going pick category iot example think iot still undefined think edge think device could benefit connected cloud almost literally limitless mean device room connected cloud already even device walk retail outlet think potential cloud opportunity whereas device addition compute get data analysis think better serving customer really hard put finger big going get think untapped opportunity people even thought yet think additional monetization opportunity identified monetized yet right talked little bit service like cosmos db data side talked security sort ai machine learning functionality actually utilized big way today sort woven sort new application development older application really early get real mainstream adoption yes think something like ai perspective different way could monetize one build ai existing apps make better people feeling like getting new additional value apps already consuming paying think piece see lot integration product today two lot company want understand like `` possible either mc partner organization basically get consultant contract helping drive innovation build business think big service component tech also thinking around tech evolve business think partner u big service component going help drive revenue folk want consume stuff sort per byte basis service available pay go consume want monetization strategy well think add expanding tam got think biggest investor concern come sort azure public cloud general risk commoditization big vendor putting lot capital work going able differentiate solution time going differentiation microsoft brings market infrastructure service platform service sustain price going race bottom term cheap compute cheap storage run environment think differentiation infrastructure service platform service maintaining price point microsoft longer term david m. q keith wei david m. q keith wei david m. think u company obligation keep delivering value top core storage compute think good job think ai one example iot another example even em security continue expand security offering top cloud dynamic people always asking think dynamic strategy oﬃce great saas offering would agree ought storage compute business adding value top paas typically better margin iaa saas stuff much better margin really sticky think incumbent u make sure driving service top think long people pay u got one last one azure term sort gross margin profile overall cloud gross margin trending really nicely past couple year recent quarter ahead expectation amy two year ago talked sort azure gross margin scaling line seen like aws similar scale still hold true still think could sort align sort seen aws time yes think still hold true already said believe could gross margin profile aws point time reality business getting really big think reach point sort hit chronicle gross margin number think yet still think room improvement think eventually get point say `` gross margin going start least moderate gross margin growth going start moderate still feel like good runway got shifting back hybrid discussion well think sort hybrid positioning help guy differentiate aws google seeing differentiation actually win guy deal today certainly see differentiation see hybrid message landing think u primary benefit customer 2 primary benefit customer one cheaper way pay stuff twice hybrid offering paying want move cloud move window server license cloud covered certainly cheaper option two think timeline perspective give lot ﬂexibility one thing company said u along `` hi made big investment current infrastructure want throw move think q keith wei david m. q keith wei david m. q keith weissabout think able allow continue run current infrastructure get cloud able expand cloud really like time frame time frame good news got think ﬂexibility expressed least satya amy talked u lot term azure hybrid use benefit contracting methodology customer talk u exactly sort give ﬂexibility customer sort financial impact thinking investor looking result sort rise hybrid use benefit show income statement sure basically hybrid use benefit say licensed window server sql server current contract run license cloud going run license aws example going aws going pay u additional license run aws environment said `` look already paid microsoft could run azure additional cost cheaper show income statement largely revenue question keep getting asked lot think window server growth window server growth think perception going start decreasing materially obviously seen decent growth number part hybrid offering way structured show revenue fact tied cloud offering try stay pretty pure term account stay side part customer eventually shift sql server license cloud still stay shift revenue right way accounting revenue think would continue account looking ir person make sure script answer yes would revenue got mentioned concern people around server tool part come sort expectation sort server shipment going slowing go negative window server tied server shipment right concerned sort declining server shipment environment negatively impacting broader server tool business microsoft david m. q keith wei david m. q keith wei david m. server tool business healthy people seen number reported good solid q2 feel good outlook intelligent cloud business still feel like demand still confident customer going continue purchase product way look going back gross margin question second obviously former world gross margin high simply shipping cd cost lower building data center example also feel like much offset expanding cloud opportunity way look yes gross margin percentage important really also think least equally important gross margin dollar driven business continue expand cloud gross margin opportunity absolute dollar perspective much material feel like gross margin shift settle end good dollar gross margin growth well continue drive percentage gross margin cloud got really asking question little bit different way like driver like mentioned hybrid cloud hybrid use advantage guy started talking lot last year business growing digit quite time core driver server tool business yes well think core driver continued data center people think using window server data center one thing said along continuing geographic footprint data center others well window server pretty popular product people license data center know going continue drive growth business question get long continue see cloud role getting smaller anytime soon think eﬃciencies gained generally think growth continue got talk little bit azure stack sort problem customer azure stack looking solve particular kind traction guy seen azure stack think really first rolled last year kind traction seen solution thus far yes azure stack really intended customer one maybe want little bit control want azure stack environment control access cloud sort intermittent one example example folk q keith wei david m. q keith wei david m. q keith wei david m. always connected example take cruise ship maybe connected connected still need able run environment whether connected cloud trying give people comfort control environment able continue run environment whether connected industry mean lot need able feature early day azure stack good customer demand anything one thing one thing customer like choice feel like forced one decision another azure stack choice make lot time look say `` know comfortable going cloud anyhow let see like fact option want got something think term impacting financials see yet still early day think early really see material impact look part broader cloud offering plus important thing able give customer choice across range option cloud azure stack one choice got term looking sort financials end support sql server 2008 window server 2008 end support significant impact expect another significant impact financials would say significant impact think u key make smooth transition customer working customer expect see material financial growth want make sure transition good experience continue path think taking care existing customer okay sound like guy talk percentage commercial revenue coming recurring source bounce around like 85 90 since much recurring much tied contract individual product life cycle going much impact financials ... yes think right mean recurring number last one pretty close 90 plus minus continuing migrate customer move q keith wei david m. q keith wei david m. q keith weissthrough cloud transition think recurring revenue net new got want talk competitive environment hybrid touched little bit seems like lot motion past year think people starting realize hybrid architecture going mainstay large enterprise seen response sort microsoft strong positioning aws came outpost offering anything seeing marketplace today early see outpost well see sale environment would say early day well think benefit u hybrid offer big share big presence already come new offering lot time cloud version old offering transition much smoother something anybody need ramp get going u existing footprint well new footprint many case near super helpful easier experience customer come add new stuff growth opportunity u think cloud vendor existing footprint trying come offering way mimic mirror feel like customer already using stuff already make better experience guess one could argue aws relationship vmware trying got vmware environment already something comfortable could run vmware public cloud environment aws kind familiar interface familiar solution portfolio running public cloud environment credible threat hybrid cloud storage microsoft well think aws obviously formidable competitor lot respect aws exactly intended think still 2 company 1 okay 2 company looking become 1 ibm plus red hat similar least term sort positioning acquisition investor ibm bought red hat think going sort improve hybrid cloud strategy guy compete red hat lot operating system side equation lot different area compete ibm think david m. q keith wei david m. q keith weissthat really going change competitive dynamic seeing 2 vendor get together well year ago really started developing much better relationship red hat right half vms linux feel like open source presence lot customer want mixed environment want open source existing vendor mix want continue relationship red hat think beneficial think confident continue make work customer think interest think red hat ibm interest continue work closely together see continuing got want switch back broader cloud gross margin one way think sort cloud gross margin kind function model view much capex investment sort expanding footprint expanding global footprint cloud investing much spent filling data center within utilization function effectively utilizing capex within data center fair kind framework think cloud gross margin story yes think fair framework point time couple year ago getting lot question cloud gross margin said `` hi playing got started game little late expand geographic footprint pretty accelerated way went lot money go land data center networking thing go building data center feel like good geographic presence feel like best global presence cloud provider think started seeing growth cloud gross margin focused driving eﬃciencies rather driving geographic expansion focused `` okay built lot cloud get eﬃcient started vms per server kind good stuff really driving improvement gross margin time competitive market aws google focused delivering best price customer time price coming driving eﬃciencies key u make sure driving eﬃciencies faster gross margin faster price coming still expand gross margin feel like game got think potential drive eﬃciencies assuming tech tech software running top david m. q keith wei david m. q keith wei david m. still probably lot eﬃciencies could grind plan yes think still also think lot expansive growth talked thing would say eventually hit law large number going pretty big number see abating anytime soon ultimately get point think start moderate right feel like still good growth still good eﬃciencies got one thing came last quarter seemed like disconnect lot data point investor getting component supplier oems ship hyperscale cloud vendor like talking sort weakness demand trend sort shipment coming cloud vendor including microsoft saw really good demand trend term sort azure growth dead stable term 76 growth capex number still really strong disconnect getting want say bad read sort timing difference see component supplier versus kind see demand trend revenue trend well think part move time eﬃciencies drive core fabric example get utilization server utilization networking bandwidth look series quarter even year core fabric get better amount hardware think maybe even though cloud market continues expand fast faster think equipment perspective getting smarter use utilization look like know call disconnect would say sure growth rate industry simply get better utilization hardware used linear got shifting gear developer one actually always fond relationship developer good relationship developer one biggest news item 2018 acquisition github squarely aimed sort developer community fostering relationship talk u little bit github important acquisition microsoft impact azure side house sort environment want developer building stuff q keith wei david m. q keith weissthat right happy github acquisition spirit even talked red hat partnership started developing good relationship github year ago satya scott guthrie example involved frequently meeting github management team opportunity came acquire github like u clearly existing relationship customer seeing benefit management team knew strength opportunity came said exactly said `` hi 30 million developer 30 developer lot good news think azure mostly really embrace developer community think satya clear articulating look acquisition really look community perspective like community serve community could benefit cloud even github committed making sure github presence major cloud microsoft cloud think company work together even opportunity educate azure think developing apps top azure certainly promoting azure github community github developer really whatever cloud want build going support think u community growing community benefit azure great github strength among developer got shifting gear oﬃce 365 commercial sort move oﬃce 365 say one big success microsoft past three year work outside think guy would agree half kind unit seat oﬃce moved oﬃce 365 thinking world trajectory oﬃce 365 basis past peak term unit enough pricing side hill sort sustain type growth seeing oﬃce 365 business think vector term think oﬃce 365 growth one said sort halfway point little past term moving customer still big growth opportunity u even though sort point two e5 offering example think technology service provide maybe replace existing service maybe augment existing service look e5 new sku think arpu opportunity really go benefit customer taking advantage stack third continue push smb space still think seat penetration arpu may still strong solid look existing customer base think new skus like e5 think smb growth vector oﬃce david m. q keith wei david m. q keith wei david m. q keith weissgot think pushing arpu higher time think likely going see e7 sku coming corporate given functionality thinking today maybe drop e1 skus push guy force onto e3 e5 price increase start roll oﬃce 365 day yes would say taking sort random order feel like customer benefit e1 sku long customer benefit still going continue offering think always new functionality add oﬃce team great example great adoption team tech personally use internally happy think team think going say likely likely going add new tech current oﬃce offering figure best strategy customer monetization look oﬃce say `` taking price side focus u focused adding value customer existing offering customer new current would say 3 choice likely add offering tech got mentioned expansion term potential user base assuming talking f1 sku yes talk u little bit let take oﬃce 365 value proposition giving worker mean perspective sort number user huge expansion potential number user outside core information worker big expansion term number user monetization obviously different think whole different user maybe whatever reason old world oﬃce seen tied pc need tied pc simple mobile device type user think user get organization using oﬃce way shape form loyal going microsoft really getting expanded presence customer base couple question want take chance get question audience question audience q unidentified participant david m. q unidentified participant david m. q unidentified participant david m. signed lot recent deal large company exxonmobil last week also walmart kroger walgreens gap et cetera view evolution relationship existing customer moving transformative large deal yes would say good news microsoft almost company customer way shape form lot time existing customer existing customer going whole new opportunity need basically reframe conversation personally get spend lot time deal bigger deal super exciting customer u also looking u sort lead way u existing customer renews go process continuing customer existing customer say `` need think thing completely differently think like `` hi want continue customer help drive transformation addition exxon announced deal walgreens deal walmart lot big company want move new world also mean continuing existing relationship case could talk gaming business integrate cloud going forward see opportunity yes sorry said business gaming business video gaming business game business u gaming long time watched gaming evolve cloud business sort away hardware think cloud good news percentage user gaming small one intense see gaming growth business u would describe unique position sort like saas software running iaa paas gaming also core offering well infrastructure think put u unique position optimize also give lot choice gamers said lot gaming company popular title running u know q keith wei david m. distribution also help drive eﬃciencies look gaming certainly expansive business u got unfortunately take u right end allotted time thank much joining u dave yes thanks keith
