welcome everyone amy hood chief financial oﬃcer microsoft kevin scott executive vice president ai chief technology oﬃcer wanted welcome kevin talk directly investor given significance ai leadership position ai era wanted spend time talking myriad question gotten meeting investor conference call think help frame growth opportunity ahead really speaking consider person charge running show let jump right first question get asked way kevin ask way listen seen multiple hype cycle tech crypto metaverse transformative ai really question answer multiple hype cycle ai grad school called ai winter many boom bust cycle like wikipedia page describing bust look like say like machine learning ai work since stopped computer science professor 2003 really interesting exponential trajectory 20 year think kind ﬂat part curve 20 year like really started see inﬂection like starting first 2012 realization finally compute data needed really extract performance deep neural network seen remarkable way one reason done investment openai built supercomputing infrastructure able build new category application calling model past handful year become behave really like platform thing training conditioning single use big piece infrastructure build use across like many many many many thing look technology cycle amy hood kevin scotthave gone lifetime personal computing internet mobile revolution think sort next thing progression evolution technology really change way build software way talking folk try describe profound actually writing computer program using computing technology way 180 year ada lovelace wrote first program 180 year ago thing le way since powerful computing device powerful software abstraction basically human want get computing device something either skilled programmer get skilled programmer anticipate need run program written ai tool anyone use express thing want accomplish ﬂexible way get computer thing like done progression yet term much capable technology going get interesting one kevin would say perspective talking customer showing every conversation asking hype different asking hey listen quickly based really said make much approachable solving real problem people every seat organization feel see opportunity think asking deploy far gosh real thing certainly resonates given broad sort excitement investor know ai strategy differentiates really think amount news sheer news come past feel like long time really three four month maybe help distill difference plan make different yeah mean think strong point view thought ai platform trending past five solid year like started transformation inside microsoft year even partnership openai part really believe model becoming platform believe going small handful going use foundation software creating rethought build infrastructure way design deploy data center compute networking look like way software development environment look like talked little bit year build like notion stack distinctive think lamp stack beginning internet revolution thing say u one line investing past five year reason see amy hood kevin scott amy hood kevin scott amy hood kevin scottthis news focused way built platform top application getting built delivered way would able produce many copilot application microsoft 365 copilot bing chat chatgpt probably going say whole bunch copilot even launched let get carried away way would able deliver real platform underlying would expensive painful one independent thing think interesting talked kevin platform really approach every problem company people think approach ai incredibly similar yeah thought would encourage investor go back look build keynote key aspect every layer platform yeah built mind think particular certain thing really resonated microsoft fabric example right really resonated broke really different think also hard sometimes capture large technological transformation happen think would say sort generational moment term watching innovation showing across world across company size think probably make exciting particular think developer last week mean certainly changing perspective always tell people think oh platform well audience always asks `` well revenue show really come two place right tool service customer use right build ai apps service run azure openai apis run azure infrastructure point going built every microsoft cloud solution everyone whether announced announced whether named aspect something show think reason sort next generation ai business fastest growing 10 billion business history think confidence energy seeing amy hood kevin scott amy hood kevin scottyeah 100 thing say really general platform like lot different way 10 billion arr going first show like people want come use infrastructure whether training model whether running open source model got whether making api call one big frontier model built openai like product like slightly different potential business model like way going able sort monetize think really interesting like excited developer even top probably going get business model existed history like going business model innovation happening well really hallmark almost big technology shift technical transformation platform transformation business model innovation think always exciting lived maybe first transition cloud around second one think way people investor ask `` gosh worried money take invest try remind people company different spot leading cycle understand run cloud business said something really important earlier built single platform ground effectively used consistently every service frankly decade ago term reusability fungibility think course see scaled capex cog growth associated also far better spot started ability leverage confidence feeling customer demand feel quite optimistic yeah mean thing say capex like capex deploying feel like got go spend catch like capex deploying feel like gigantic opportunity ahead u going big return investment capital yeah think put head different spot term talking customer see developer another question get lot investor customer view think really topic read lot ethic regulation overall safety come ai really capable share topic work already done responsible ai principle know one key component think every day scene yeah one thing think actually another strategic advantage building platform think think amy hood kevin scottsafety responsibility security system one necessary bit platform ca platform without whole number reason like maybe starting customer trust trustworthy platform trustworthy infrastructure trustworthy application building looking whole discipline responsible ai many year think even joined microsoft satya satyacharged bunch people microsoft research legal team building real ai ethic responsible ai practice investing year everything need put legal team need research infrastructure need build help product team make sure test ass system safety responsibility one anecdote share press around bing chat infamous kevin roose article interesting thing like even deploying learning much build thing safety responsibility like believe everything launched adhered strictly publicly available responsible ai standard second version right even sort learning use safety system tune thing meet preference expectation user kevin roose thing basically wo even call fixed adjusted product within couple hour story breaking reason able make change quickly safety infrastructure built allowed u make sure change making particular product conform preference user make sure people using product way intended stuff built let u assessment make sure fix cause problem addressing think important said listen waiting regulation take proactive approach responsibility think going process heard also mention regulation needed said company talk conversation well think look sort technology ubiquitous impact society always regulation favorite metaphor electricity sort think ai system think like hope time similar sort impact 10 year 15 year diﬃcult time imagining world could function without get point must expect going regulation regulation generation bit way regulation power generator turbine generation facility ai probably regulation distribution electricity regulation sort endpoint technology actually get delivered product user touching know exactly regulation look like brad really brilliant job think couple week ago articulating like initial point view also believe going lot debate amy hood kevin scott amy hood kevin scottand public conversation regulation really need like like would really suspicious honestly would sign technology maybe impactful think believe need regulating yeah think interesting way thinking thing get asked lot customer focus privacy think surprise right people learn technology obviously people clear data belong customer data belongs customer like today applies world ai well use azure openai example customer data remains within tenant boundary llm data remains data applied master llm think important keep reiterating customer hearing sort question talk people yeah absolutely think said like thing make sure everyone really understands like using people data improve foundation model covenant everyone around data respect tenant absolutely respected technology whether openai model something built like like super diligent one thing lucky spent past 15 plus year building infrastructure able rely deploying new ai technology absolutely want move would say second popular question get investor call least regarding openai partnership openai choose u partnership get started people worried ip really required area considered leader valid concern two big question kevin one yeah let start first one think first foremost able bunch really amazing work openai work done testament start initial intention first deal 2019 wanted like someone outside microsoft addition research engineering team able come incredibly high level ambition trying ai would put pressure infrastructure system software could make sure building best possible platform training serving new frontier model calling amy hoodand like think anything like worked incredibly well like able design infrastructure along open ai like quickly partnership built first ai supercomputer thing trained addition using infrastructure like also able partner using model incredibly creative way power product like yeah first github copilot like deployed like whole bunch different way like relatively silently bunch product github copilot first generative product think anyone really built generative ai front center allowed u thing people thought five second launched actually impossible little bit ﬂavor like bunch application like deliver like go people mind like impossible like wow ca believe yeah nature partnership way understand ip right broad license open ai ip term deal work incredibly closely together part stack like pushed u incredibly helpful way make sure infrastructure system software think see right number people choose cloud thing definitely helped u incredible way sort scale pace delivery yeah obviously benefit tremendously well open ai like think one smartest group ai researcher planet also complement thing well like like really really ﬂuid partnership aligned platform vision aligned safety responsibility real mission incredible obligation right society pretty ﬂexible help one another think lot people little bit hard capture relationship company partnership also internal research capability partner others unique partnership fundamentally think built trust mission alignment always important thing reiterate think two key point made kevin talked broad perpetual license openai ip developed term partnership mean even partnership end would still license right ip agi thing critical think kevin lead lot conversation legal team openai ethic team sorry ai ethic team share value responsibility safe deployment ip ca tell foundational able make progress u independently make technology available respective user developer seeing happen think good everyone really keep innovative spirit ai capability

going deploy `` use case seeing today `` open mind use case see tomorrow would say maybe say thing hearing kevin think probably hear even especially possible hosted ceo campus long ago kevin hosted conversation met fascinating mean every industry whether healthcare talk epic medical record whether manufacturing talking detect describe problem plant headquarters whether education personalized tutor retail developer point think coming almost would describe global conversation industry conversation thinking term use case possible think closer industry case sure yeah think broadly speaking particular wave technology transformation going really driving productivity place people cognitive work sort totally wordy way saying white collar work like job job like anyone really using mind like something think going enormously obvious coming month like huge amount stuff cognitive work sort routine repetitive like probably super excited annoying stressful part job think almost every one thing like get impacted tool way thinking choice term describe new type software like really deliberate choice believe going lot pilot going general like bing chat chatgpt like github relatively focused particular type cognitive work think whether software development marketing customer support like prior auth insurance sort pick thing know encounter thing every day multiple time like `` ca believe still thing way moment sort finally think get get past `` ca believe still thing way get go different way think longer term real prize generally capable ai system really go solve big problem like thing talk folk know happen sort aspirational thing ai scientific expertise ability go think problem really long time said hey 100 million worth amy hood kevin scottcompute ai expert go cure pancreatic cancer form like would easiest 100 million human being ever gone spend amount pain suffering economic loss general misery disease cause aspiration future like system help u go solve problem ca solve right even using best tool better tool help u go solve really nasty problem think many way time period real concern power technology far much optimism possibility think two thing coexist think frankly always large transition history thing first kevin thank much joining u today way think better person tell investor vision different person responsible making sure vision strategy get executed best capability thank taking large mantle u joining u today thanks everybody watching getting bit educated term different approach say waited long time get productive company kevin maybe final secret get increase cfo productivity least thanks everyone look forward delivering really kevin customer developer frankly society think right adoption technology leadership position thank
