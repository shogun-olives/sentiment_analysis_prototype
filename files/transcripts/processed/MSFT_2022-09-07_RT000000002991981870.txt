opportunity sort look full range service think put u good spot able help customer le frequently speak span consolidating m365 security product leveraging ai ml build new product shipping customer even sort optimizing developer resource taking advantage low code code platform able expand many people develop way look resource across customer span obviously macroeconomic environment even job market developer market sort ability le across facet pretty excited offer great maybe could ask question specifically azure cloud consumption big topic among investor peer partner work marketplace talked customer optimizing cloud spend seen slowdown cloud consumption even azure business recent quarter corey sanderstalk consumption trend seeing azure customer approaching managing optimizing cloud spend topic yes think mean general think conversation customer first looking across full microsoft cloud sort looking across capability think spend prem way spend cloud way think sort azure specifically

sort changed work customer ph press conversation coming pretty regularly opportunity shifting le sort vendor much strategic partner ability sort solve immediate need also partnering strategy change many customer obviously still thinking change sell would get part front line judson think selling full microsoft cloud versus selling sort point solution opportunity course customer look full microsoft cloud broad saving versus looking sort point point potential saving therein also sort change little bit built sort new team come sort excited build around leveraging combination service solution able drive value getting best service spanning left right opportunity certainly reduces overall spend able take q tyler radke corey sander q tyler radkeadvantage sometimes frequently improves top line well able create new value putting service together think unique opportunity unique role seller solution thus get sort deep conversation price per core actually also opportunity really strategic partner customer work goal strategy service help get think breadth service put u better spot conversation drive right outcome customer great think number report azure think last time saw

different conversation macro conversation conversation slightly different u lot le sort immediate opportunity immediate anxiety around strategy benefit stage customer need go need happen next 12 month need happen next 12 year think conversation becomes much interesting actually sort mentioned drive broader strategic conversation customer looking necessarily quick fix looking ability partnership able drive change sort opportunity across microsoft cloud sell build become quite advantageous u partnership customer think little bit would equate different think sort fear initial one different think sort strategic approach seen customer today got okay helpful think seeing region obviously different part globe different stage cloud transition data center versus cloud guess seeing kind regional performance differ region may seeing slowdown macro perspective prioritizing cloud le give u little bit regional commentary context cloud versus corey sander yes think sort role seen

deployment strategy global deployment enablement still see quite bit demand pretty much everywhere world think interesting sort course macroeconomic environment continues something u watch notable region shift perspective say sort mentioned point one big opportunity sort place spend lot time focusing around enabling value customer right way hybrid edge strategy really focused good reason customer deploy continue deploy environment sort agnostic think macroeconomic environment think benefit really focus team hybrid solution one enabling customer operate environment extension cloud sort simple policy simple security control consistency sort cloud environment allows sort continue take advantage investment even sometimes expand investment without necessarily sacrificing benefit cloud bring also see lot focus edge part separate maybe macro environment probably aligned area see sort edge sort proximity need actually increasing sort define spend putting sort additional server either storefront always joke sort server oil rig able sort take advantage cloud power whether ai ml solution running analytics edge still take benefit cloud capability behind seat service like azure arc defender cloud really offer unified support security last one actually seeing perspective may sort regional push frankly certainly government side look sort recent announcement microsoft cloud sovereignty announced couple month ago focus around enabling government able deploy way make sense right certainly government spend government digitalization rise exciting offering opportunity able take advantage public cloud make sense sovereign capability policy governance control also taking advantage make sense able put sort environment able leverage cloud capability like azure arc manage q tyler radke corey sandersso one seeing little bit think continue see part sovereign deployment certainly region sort growing greater interest certainly europe hot area type deployment seeing globally well yes think piece interesting context mean also heard michael dell keynote talked lot edge computing actually seen really robust server growth microsoft remained positive territory despite really strong growth azure guess kind think steady state growth given going hybrid environment going forward point industry like government really investing kind sustainable rate think azure get bigger business start decline eventually mean point think indication necessarily declining obviously michael dell talked want disagree think indication declining think continue see sort customer expanding
