city heavily penetrated go new development apt impact one existing unit knowingly intentionally solving long term opportunity would highlight recent year continued grow total transaction china double digit growing store mid teen playing long game china right comparing track mile looking u guy phenomenal footprint seeing similar level cannibalization put new store parallel draw le cannibalization part growing slower pace whereas china new unit net unit growing mid teen outlook u range 3 4 think still strong concept starbucks scale u underpins 3 4 growth rate still region u starbucks

notice talk key driver growth going forward food figure prominently strategy say food important business current sale mix think around 21 decent part business mentioned growth scale agenda significant extent rooted focus discipline think company scale like starbucks given stature brand scale globally sustain double digit eps growth long term requires considerable focus discipline one element focus clear point differentiation putting effort energy resource behind key point differentiation u relation product offering beverage innovation focus u term going drive around beverage food would say somewhat secondary sense see food complement beverage help build ticket help build additional day part necessarily key point differentiation u goal make sure consistently high quality consistent starbucks brand food product pair well innovative beverage offering food respect alcohol think seen isolated example see alcohol figuring prominently growth strategy going forward may unique occasion

average unit volume 75 lower starbucks average unit volume add two thing together even growth 80 smaller starbucks one fifth size starbucks china grown rapidly think important highlight going different occasion occasion third place occasion cafe designed way think reﬂected low average unit volume satisfy different occasion different price point also implies different quality offering going different segment market say dismiss presence established also bear mind done back extreme marketing aggressive discount think remains seen able sustain growth time compelled strip away marketing aggressive discount continuing watch see mentioned earlier one three contributing factor tapering comp growth china starbucks competition generally would say necessarily luckin specifically part mix

company category settling still credit leverage ratio lease adjusted ebitda 3 time credit rating bbb+ baa1 think starbucks terrific place term improves overall cost capital still give u ﬂexibility make kind investment believe instrumental ability sustain long term growth capex front pretty healthy capex budget building store u china referenced earlier scale u add slowing current run rate good run rate capex pat grismer q katherine fogertey pat grismersomething would cause remain higher unit growth time think capex well would first clarify say run rate speaking say last three five year capex increased dramatically really looking current spend rate year see opportunity temper take account couple thing first bring increasing focus lead growth market u china implies time transitioning market license model past year france netherlands recently thailand position would make sense right time right circumstance transition license model provide relief total capital spend addition siren
