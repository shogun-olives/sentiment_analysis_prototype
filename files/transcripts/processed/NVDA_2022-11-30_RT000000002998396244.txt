think pretty good pretty good music welcome music thanks everyone chris caso credit suisse semiconductor analyst welcome back conference next speaker nvidia know nvidia colette kress cfo coming back home arizona colette welcome thank thank chris want make opening statement first reminder presentation contains statement investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business thought open term key theme takeaway finished last quarter gave guidance fourth quarter working inventory correction needed gaming business making progress q3 definitely showed progress term reducing inventory channel also opportunity u begin beginning ada launch gaming well going quite well believe approach end q4 reached normalized level inventory gaming business secondly got great product new launch architecture gaming business data center business colette kress q chris caso colette kressand continued work automotive orin architecture ada running hopper data center business begin ramping next year start production q4 guidance wanted open key thing focused right question answer question answer great thank maybe starting think spoken investor past week seem appetite semiconductor space pullback think lot folk looking extent thing derisk making sure shoe dropped said call talked believe end demand gaming order 5 billion two quarter period 2.5 billion quarter consensus estimate gaming business running 1.5 billion quarter pretty sizable gap give confidence inventory burning point get back steady state demand even demand weakens bit know china shoe drop gaming yes correct highlighted onset saw inventory correction need help folk understand saw term solid term gaming came view normalized gaming 5 billion stretched two quarter yes always seasonality sometimes going 2.5 billion quarter give take depending quarter leading still see gaming solid continuing watch every day term seeing particularly looking western holiday right time gaming time correct inventory channel discussed plan hopefully end q4 approach end q4 solid position mean move forward start get back get point equilibrium likely get selling build channel q chris caso colette kress q chris caso colette kressada launch additional ada product see coming market following look april quarter provided guidance assume going provide guidance right put take think got thing like seasonality gaming business normalization inventory new h100 start going cloud instance starting april quarter maybe could speak thing thing consider thinking april quarter correct given guidance q4 going new year new year going year focused new product coming market ada early day right shipping shipped one card 4090 4080 starting sell well plenty opportunity innovation brought market gaming also true data center business well data center business coming forth h100 architecture great opportunity really take advantage lot innovation put focus large language model transformer big thing overall performance improvement eﬃciencies total tco get h100 ph start beginning production q4 move year start ramp h100 discussed term earnings see cloud instance already h100 start new year well know important product feel great position new product coming market h100 data center networking often coming coupled together selling h100 though ca control macro condition macro condition around world u.s. definitely europe china talked term economy really really tough right china important go april given new year holiday occurs holiday season china area well still seeing solid china however lockdown experiencing covid make thing little harder distribution sale process happen continue watch closely q chris caso colette kress q chris caso colette kress maybe could speak ada launch think perception gaming one pandemic beneficiary could go anywhere would impact thing extent seen perception success ada launch compared 30 series 20 series launch benchmark look gaming always discussed may little bit folk looked type sport pandemic see great new gamers joining market taken advantage leadership term gaming ada leader industry ampere number one number two top architecture nvidia continue watch see term steam steam still record level gamers online gaming top 15 card steam nvidia 15 15 area gamers gamers life watch industry great time also hard time sport economical choose many different form factor many different price point gaming want ada launch 4090 came yes first card card sold two week pleased see something nod u knew gaming matter time year matter situation still important entertainment industry okay pivot data center bit h100 maybe speak mean term performance customer mean term content nvidia yes h100 term performance improvement depending type workload 6x see a100 went mlperf training mlperf benchmarking inference case hand everything nvidia show term outperformance see market led u design h100 continued advancement ai every season every year something new still early day ai large language model size large language model inﬂuence natural language processing within front center say recommendiator engine still way go popular consumer internet company well make sure marketing appropriately targeted h100 really hone think development h100 done coordination q chris caso colette kress q chris casowith customer coordination enterpriser coordination hyperscalers seen would need move forward h100 tip system thinking process ai beginning data enters data center time leaf see lot work interconnects link networking memory assist full process yes mean good segue next question sustainable advantage ai think much investor question growth rate ai point think much question nvidia leadership space room packed going forward sustain mean factor silicon concern voiced past thing like company taking perch hyperscalers thing challenge retain advantage think product coming market may first discus term performance availability people ask talk see importantly software built along way software last quarter last year overall developing talking 10 year 15 developing software platform really transforming world think computing computing architecture cpu lot time use gpu really rethinking application rethinking use hardware gpu full stack view software essential able package create full system package nvaie really help enterprise start beginning work term ai continue term workload sdks leading industry top application begin work hard think new chip work model software somebody work work 3.5 million developer develop solution hardware software using full system every time bring something market really developer looking going use u think extremely successful continuing model equally much focus term hardware focusing development platform focusing software colette kress q chris casocould give u help think growth rate data center time something incredibly different diﬃcult model part think underestimated growth good problem going forward need get despair growth rate within cloud part business half enterprise business half content asp rising well think way lot folk done taken look figured multiple cloud growth really accurate way looking know another way nvidia look internally discussed earnings talked business data center broken talking hyperscales talking vertical industry seeing end quarter probably 50 going work providing little bit disclosure going forward hyperscales important large company many also cloud company term serving cloud instance enterprise take time look seeing also cloud give better understanding really vast nature enterprise using ai accelerated computing go forward stay tuned u move forward see hyperscales cloud instance need many different type industry also researcher also higher education seeing period time cloud continuing important part important part historically likely going forward think challenge economy cloud instance get started easier path working significant amount capital build overall data center also becoming diﬃcult enterprise real size organization master complex configuration seen data center today cloud going important think announcement made q3 talking work hyperscale azure oracle selling enterprise real good breakthrough seeing important cloud provider also realizing importance relationship enterprise well software stack ability market software stack create instance enterprise could get whether built put cloud really pleased term partnership working cloud provider mean say time perhaps see cloud part business going bigger part business maybe see migration cloud eﬃcient way dealing workload colette kress q chris caso colette kress q chris caso colette kress tough say different growth rate still many desire stepping back indifferent right indifferent whether consumer enterprise want build prem want use cloud instance whether hyperscale want many different way use ai use accelerated computing throughout world indifferent yes cloud important industry going forward also want speak one product cycle expecting year grace cpu product get added maybe could speak term timing think arm model expecting moderate impact second half year speak mean customer term performance mean nvidia term content yes grace grace first cpu first arm grace cpu coming market plan start testing bringing sampling first half second half talk market grace grace work together hopper architecture geared toward large model type ai general purpose cpu specific focus accelerated ai together excited bring market worked really understand importance cpu workload ai see second half year capture value obviously customer buy board grace remove need accompanying intel amd server cost platform pretty close would a100 today nvidia position capture value essentially giving customer better performance actually remove additional cost developing system total tco moved accelerated computing one architecture data center improving tco enabling dgx incorporating grace hopper together better tco customer specific cpu workload trying uncommon though u also use peer cpu well within dgx also beneficial u long moving accelerated computing q chris caso colette kress q chris caso colette kress q chris caso colette kress right safe say content gain adding higher performance nvidia company generally price value drive performance market asp going yes price innovation saving tco really underling whether gaming whether data center trying fair enough macro concern mean several colleague credit suisse concern cloud capex 2023 obviously pressure enterprise moderate view h100 grace product cycle go 2023 something take little modern expectation expect 2024 think studied continuing watch macroeconomic condition one thing see time enterprise really study work going purchase sometimes lengthening time overall close deal may happen though certain industry ai accelerator important work important monetization platform important term new growth focusing accelerated computing ai whether sustainability trying think use energy eﬃcient platform leading edge ai important many business good position new architecture well leader industry macroeconomic condition though watching carefully know cloud essential keep going time okay pivot something else nvidia spoken pretty consistently last year think high investor focus software think software interesting add software economics semiconductor company model could pretty important important expect software financials go next 18 month 24 month yes started selling software separately example data center product gaming product software since beginning time done packaged key software probably three different area q chris caso colette kress q chris caso colette kressone nvidia ai enterprise set system software help every enterprise get started essentially treat see many enterprise software capability able monitor job able manage whole data center whole essentially get started much workload diﬃcult enterprise start would necessarily team engineer essentially also area enterprise want software applying application work want know support update keep software current double win term first piece second one omniverse omniverse important area thinking 3d virtual world simulation much build design twin environment many different use case area sell pod enterprise customer even individual basis third piece focusing automotive working automotive term av agreement selling software along hardware maintaining software life car meaningful piece three area u getting started working selling even see h100 certain form h100 come software coupled together h100 excited see driver also improvement term gross margin long term see drop chance get see software kind bit granularity near future something contemplated giving information key customer software key milestone reach term software think would beneficial help walk u journey u okay maybe check see packed room question somebody like ask anyway continuous think automotive well automotive transition infotainment part business trended waiting ada full impact sound like kind edge beginning occur maybe could speak bit correct seeing today automotive business solid growth right orin architecture came market important time q chris caso colette kress q chris caso colette kress q chris casowhere two important thing automotive industry ev electrical vehicle well av dealing ev customer really thinking complete redesign car bottom building car scratch important piece computing platform orin exact great product soup nut working consolidating different software one computing platform also adding av feature work seeing nevs across world particularly china area really lodged orin architecture using also agreement large company daimler jlr future really provide hardware full software stack coming next couple year start term start term sampling little bit year see term volume automotive two thing occurring time really guess way think 2023 kind going nev larger oems.is right way think believe general direction go nev material said auto business strong growth problem strong growth lot different area kind stayed smaller percentage revenue get oem larger like daimler expect auto grow significant portion nvidia revenue point correct look fiscal year believe significant amount keep mind automotive customer within car important purchasing nvidia also important data center customer order build want av future computing back data center important part also working course workstation since beginning time interesting see yes within automotive car keep mind also great business data center colette kress q chris caso colette kress q chris casookay almost time end question margin guess nvidia case fabulous many product margin fairly stable anything think regard growth rate different business spending consider regard gross margin operating margin looking gross margin continue see manufacturing cost remember much engineering working software first value distribute term innovation allowed u solid gross margin last year couple year certainly seen cost manufacturing cost component contract manufacturing continued increase absorbed lot still solid gross margin take opportunity time look new architecture value providing also take account cost take manufacturing important piece look overall operating margin another case strong operating margin time always opportunity u think spend money quite eﬃcient company 25,000 people large company operating well billion took time hiring focus engineer focus team think team rallied around also continuing look make sure spending money wisely focus focused gross margin long term also focusing operating margin well great look like time colette thanks time thank chris thanks everyone
