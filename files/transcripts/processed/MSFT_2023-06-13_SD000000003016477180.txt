sustainability accessibility security really want evolve responsible ai something people must comply something actually really strive take pride love thank could talk kind alluded even opening important microsoft success mitigate risk mean employee customer create new opportunity whatever want hit within basket question ask melanie maybe start u well first basket issue really see three way getting house order customer globally impact earlier month released annual report may year annual sustainability report really show progress journey talked way 2030 commitment water positive zero waste protect ecosystem reported carbon get detail carbon business grew business grew 18 emission actually declined 0.5 water able contract 15 15 million cubic meter water replenishment project really going volumetric lifetime project waste zero waste target actually diverted around 12,000 metric ton solid waste landfill incineration across direct operational footprint ecosystem actually protected 12,000 acre land meeting company commitment intricately interdependent transitioning world clean energy infrastructure end day path similar progress appear slow foundation really set ready take place like training marathon runner think u take focus planning perseverance reach finish line community microsoft 9,000 strong microsoft member employee provide vital component collaboratively driving progress environmental change within company externally brett iversen natasha crampton brett iversenon second basket customer sustainability journey tech company role play thousand corporate customer put trust microsoft technology many customer already made climate pledge microsoft working help move pledge progress much like company manage measure microsoft committed helping customer measure environmental impact timely accurate manner june last year 2022 launched microsoft cloud sustainability comprehensive environmental sustainability management platform includes microsoft sustainability manager microsoft azure customer also benefited significant upgrade past year emission impact dashboard help customer understand emission impact result use microsoft cloud also released preview version something call microsoft planetary computer enables customer measure monitor manage ecosystem may affected operation make important decision related climate risk yes lot happening three girl home peak perk hear sustainability talked amongst peer group well would add responsible ai point view always operated microsoft core belief designing developing ai responsibly leading developing responsible product developing fundamentally better product known trust really essential adoption new product particularly true talking frontier tech like ai working hard operationalize effort across company build culture responsible ai mentioning look employee trained responsible ai practice learning integrate practice work building tool providing resource help journey look customer exploring immense potential ai turning microsoft ai product insight deploy use responsibly really want share much committed making sure customer knowledge necessary use ai responsibly part published material

well busy sure trust piece mentioned lot friend sale side going kind cloud portion business product solution sell biggest natasha cramptonthing like would think price thing like competing great company trust piece biggest portion decision hearing consistently touched maybe another one involved responsible ai work key point development help u understand evolved time move principle really point kind core operation sure think fair say decade ago field responsible ai pioneering microsoft barely existed nearly seven year worked advance responsible ai company think sort building artificial intelligence product service grounded strong ethical principle let give two example concretely progressed practice last seven year beginning six principle mentioned earlier principle continue serve north star principle alone enough one thing done taken principle really provide concrete actionable guidance engineering team basically answered question build ai system fairly mean accountable mean transparent playbook engineering team use mentioned make available publicly really spell concrete actionable step need taken live commitment second working tooling one way making sure consistent practice responsible ai microsoft build tool keep engineer workﬂows whether tooling fairness interpretability making sure really understanding seeing error clustering particular way built tooling team

iversen melanie nakagawaso way think responsible ai today journey continue go forward know need learn continue evolve along way especially government starting define concrete policy regulation govern space go committed sharing learning making sure learning outside company well yeah governance point important sustainability share many important issue governance sustainability guess privilege opportunity commitment announced satya amy hood brad smith 2020 really demonstrating executive sponsorship commitment governance perspective internally microsoft also charge carbon fee internally business group help u work carbon removal carbon reduction really help business group see opportunity mitigation plan reduction plan could underscore point enough importance internal governance allows u frankly move forward key issue yes resonates yes thank stay know newer microsoft maybe little bit brought think helping company reach ambitious sustainability commitment see work evolving time yes still relative recording letting know relatively new first incredible privilege pleasure join company frankly one forefront leading ambitious commitment around sustainability matching action annual report year really chock full specific project action initiative investing got background policymaker diplomat investor private equity fund working say tech company around world part brought really bringing nexus technology policy finance together sustainability perspective leverage experience role sustainability microsoft part journey get led brett iversen natasha cramptonalso term kind go past month really learning microsoft journey get 2030 goal making investment every day sit wake policy team washington d.c. help inform u happening u europe around world policy action helping drive sustainability agenda really benefiting fact 2015 world government got together said committed greater degree celsius warming future world really important since 2015 government putting place policy initiative action company stepping helping drive business u participate sustainability also helping drive commitment actually meeting goal need planet quite journey far excited yes good well happy already talked bit microsoft operationalizes responsible ai commitment get little deeper governance management issue get lot question like board involvement team work microsoft leadership even broader org achieve goal natasha help sure really cliche say responsible ai meaningful really start top microsoft chairman ceo satya nadella supported creation responsible ai council oversee effort across company council chaired vice chair president brad smith report also kevin scott chief technology oﬃcer kevin charge setting technology vision company well overseeing microsoft research think joint leadership really core effort sends clear message microsoft going leader technology ai microsoft going leader responsible ai responsible ai council convenes regularly brings together representative policy engineering research group dedicated responsible ai includes oﬃce responsible ai lead aether committee also bring together senior business partner partner responsible implementation program team part find council meeting challenging refreshing challenging working hard set problem progress always linear yet know got confront diﬃcult question make sure driving accountability meeting refreshing collective energy wisdom among member responsible ai council often come away fresh idea advance state art melanie nakagawa brett iversen melanie nakagawa brett iversen melanie nakagawaand specific question brett board environmental social public policy committee board provides oversight responsible ai program regular engagement committee really make sure bringing full rigor microsoft enterprise risk management program responsible ai work actually similarly espp committee board also provides oversight sustainability work well love investor love hearing thank melanie much discussion challenging topic scope 3 emission address audience maybe familiar greenhouse gas emission company source purchased electricity rather across entire value chain going upstream downstream customer using product think microsoft challenge help others address know direct control sure challenging topic well great knowledge scope 3 fantastic yeah right studied studied know multiple speaker microsoft implementation stage sustainability journey really highlighted key part scope 3 fixated something need know scope 3 microsoft around 96 overall emission scope 1 2 around 4 scope 3 ultimately decarbonization challenge opportunity necessitates best practice business technology policy among thousand global stakeholder made carbon negative commitment 2020 challenge support sustainability business also invitation world participate journey translating action action impact major roadblock way call emission sector like material think concrete prime example growing source scope 3 emission one example addition concrete semiconductor chip global manufacturing semiconductor could probably account estimate 3 overall greenhouse gas emission 2040 one big challenge manufactured country south korea japan taiwan clean energy abundant service type manufacturing facility decarbonizing semiconductor brett iversen natasha cramptonsectors concrete material really depends transitioning world cleaner energy source cleaner grid cleaner infrastructure future country build operate cleanest grid really believe going competitive advantage economy really serving customer like u really want see purchasing tied aligned commitment country microsoft others ambitious climate commitment country going want invest procure also another way addressing challenge semiconductor material microsoft dollar climate innovation fund fund investing technology company stage renewable electricity low carbon material also invest fund called southeast asia clean energy facility help build renewable energy project throughout region another company really exciting highlight called prometheus material produce concrete building sequester carbon manufacturing process technology estimated reduce carbon intensity 90 compared traditional unit another similar company called carbon cure produce concrete injecting carbon dioxide concrete mixing mineralizes strengthens product reduces overall emission type investment could see appearing physical infrastructure type infrastructure mean compare traditional actually choosing product potentially better product end day type innovation investing thinking fascinating like example interesting hear especially somebody spends time finance side house thank natasha similarly space obviously huge interest get every question since calendar year started ir team included ai topic given recent advance generative ai incorporating across product service responsible ai issue unique generative ai company working address well first let say happy come generative ai moment benefit seven year responsible ai work point allowed u mature governance system tool practice get ready moment much practice building time directly relevant generative ai work well generative ai system specifically use method make sure identifying measuring mitigating risk said build long experience operating brett iversen natasha crampton brett iversenthese enterprise consumer service course deep partnership openai well really critical yes perhaps easiest illustrate unique consideration using new bing implementation example sort thing mentioned first step process identify risk new system new bing process called red teaming red teaming allows bring together team really push edge system understand challenge thing red teaming bit like identifying iceberg ahead important understand iceberg really understand size shape dealing engaged red teaming core component system especially new model came openai moved systematic approach measurement could start measure size shape iceberg really different type risk surface new system move mitigation phase purpose phase really think layered approach adopt mitigating rest system many way really use defense depth type approach similar might think security context make sure bake safety right model core system wrap safety around different layer top well core issue addressed part identify measure mitigate process included making sure response would get new bing would grounded bing search result sometimes people refer error generative ai system make hallucination u think situation grounded response bing search result huge help u bing infrastructure really leverage taken number step also made sure using past work made sure bing producing response might reinforcing stereotype otherwise unfair couple example leveraged past work layered new mitigation technique top feel confident continue build system harness learning think incremental release strategy carefully controlled release new technology extremely beneficial core part approach going forward love different responsible ai sharing given u discipline element across heard something side embedded function melanie nakagawaintegrated cohesive conversation think critical come different topic given still picturing u injecting concrete like need learn stuff given together appreciate tell see ai sustainability interacting future get question think concept together potential harm rapid ai transformation environmental commitment ﬂipping promise ai maybe accelerant global sustainability would two help think maybe melanie start u one thanks great believe ai essential part building net zero future ai already playing role improving sustainability management well measurement accountability think really kind awesome potential opportunity set using ai pick theme earlier concrete cement seeing use ai really accelerate rapidly discovery alternative material high carbon material cement think ai reduce design validation process new material order magnitude lead faster innovation material concrete used building material thing data center reducing overall environmental footprint carbon footprint data center ai provides opportunity go process really rapid iteration also used ai partner create satellite imagery produce first kind atlas living atlas map world measure solar wind installation planet allowing user evaluate clean energy transition progress different part world different country track time tool called global renewables watch partnership nature conservancy nonprofit planet really provides unique spatial data land use trend help achieve dual aim environmental protection increasing renewable energy capacity around world prospect ai advance sustainability tremendous second thing must also think side ledger one side amazing potential ai accelerate clean energy transition sustainability goal side also recognize ai model use energy scaled compute committed bringing additional energy onto grid around world also working ensure energy coming resource electricity microsoft today already one largest purchaser corporate purchaser renewable power helping advance innovative commitment energy source like contract announced fusion energy company called helion back may also investing research measure energy use carbon impact ai working way help make large ai system eﬃcient thing green software initiative reducing energy consumption eﬃcient compute network traﬃc brett iversen natasha crampton brett iversen melanie nakagawa perfect natasha add interesting fusion two concept well think melanie capture key point well mean think essential use ai address biggest challenge time course includes sustainability well also really grateful melanie leading charge making sure proactively addressing energy need compute demand new ai model work better define question also undertake research also critically important need deeply understand problem space make sure working towards finding answer durable going forward one dimension perhaps add may released blueprint ai governance part blueprint recognizing technology move forward important make sure proper control ai make sure realizing benefit one specific point recommended thought ai system controlling critical infrastructure safety break think system government would need define class system might controlling electricity grid water supply similar safety protocol put place important core technology need put brake ai system well might think safety break put elevator school bus train conceptually need ai safety break critical infrastructure well make sense covered lot ground short period time thank close share little bit think future area thought road would say group melanie start u sure well future optimistic optimist nature really feel good business investing purchasing confident strategy remain committed reaching 2030 commitment going continue help build foundation 2030 thing first going advancing partnership advocating favorable clean energy policy bring energy grid investing country build operate cleanest grid second going leverage role one largest purchaser corporate purchaser clean energy renewable energy going building market
