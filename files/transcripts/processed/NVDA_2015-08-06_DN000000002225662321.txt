analyst average 20 plus year buy experience broker dealer provide buy sell hold recommendation industry company context specifically semiconductor industry terminal user explore bloomberg intelligence analysis pressing industry theme company issue well jennifer rieregulatory ip trend typing bi semi g. also idc data semiconductor data semi industry trade body dashboard thought talk company thick and/or litigation matter undergoing significant intellectual property issue company qualcomm nvidia marvell micron also talk little bit ip theme regulatory trend going industry also talk offensive versus defensive patent thought start samsung one thing done extensive work effect samsung qualcomm company qualcomm choosing make chip versus buying qualcomm integrated baseband obviously qualcomm lost samsung handset potential additional factor one samsung balance tip towards lower end handset share loss towards higher end handset asp also get skewed downward heightened competition industry mediatek well discussed length dashboard part qualcomm deck would urge investor people interested qualcomm go bi semi also consideration part strategic review try split company two explicitly suggested would create weaker segment long run perhaps best interest company long run however segment might attract attention multiple suitor backdrop qualcomm recently settled ndrc china would permit licensing segment potentially gain revenue stream handset royalty make handset maker china use qualcomm chip background qualcomm jen start paint picture u investigation qualcomm underway across different regulatory agency current status timing potential fine action outcome mentioned eu specifically could levy largest sign right thank anand well yes qualcomm investigation actually quite year across world competition authority europe korea japan u recently concluded investigation china related way license standard essential patent pretty much finished investigation intrusive distraction end day really see one potentially kind real impact company would europe european commission let talk going first european commission done recently sort formalized investigation two different kind conduct first one older investigation kind lagging around year started customer complaint related chipsets comply 3g standard mobile phone alleged qualcomm predatory pricing chipsets mean price chipsets marginal cost order capture sale competitor ca price low without driving business concept sort garner monopoly raise price recoup whatever lost pricing cost see really turning much anything first kind claim diﬃcult prove enforcer really want discourage low pricing little bit conﬂict goal also law predatory pricing bit unsettled europe european commission tend fine area law unsettled second kind conduct looking maybe little bit serious situation looking allegation exclusive dealing sale chipsets comply 3g 4g standard used mobile device exclusive dealing u call de facto exclusive dealing offering extreme financial incentive rebate discount condition customer purchase chipset requirement qualcomm customer really choice worth stop buying competitor hinders rival ability compete reason think serious first law exclusive dealing europe clear set precedent presumed kind conduct investigation show going harmful conduct fact good example intel fined 2009 similar allegation similar kind conduct related cpu time fined eur1.06 billion conduct requirement well could see thing bear qualcomm violated law similar kind fine could assessed qualcomm talking timing though nothing going resolve time soon thing lag year european commission statutory deadline see anything happening le year probably thing think like clarify often see news european commission fine 10 annual turnover company really rarely ever happens unlikely happen happens pick percentage 5 30 sale product wrong directed look severity antitrust defense case exclusive dealing considered sort le severe side antitrust conduct probably looking something 10 intel case took 5 multiply percentage sale number year anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasanwrongdoing ongoing basically fine fine increased company repeat offender company involvement limited decreased see potential fine see occurring way road respect korea japan really see lot impact korea also looking abuse sep seems hearing korea somewhat satisfied imposed china term change qualcomm ... royalty qualcomm would charge ... really look like much going come also u see u looking whether abuse licensing standard essential patent looking ftc looking conduct section 5 federal trade commission act usually use section 5 think conduct sort le egregious end conduct section 5 rarely ever end fine usually end cease desist order simply saying hey reasonable way license really slap wrist anything else basically fall `` deal category summarize korea big deal japan big deal u itc big deal ftc u ftc big deal watch big fine potentially timeline still unclear right exactly right okay want shift gear talk little bit ndrc qualcomm settle ndrc clear way chip utilized chinese handset maker potentially pay royalty revenue still discussion make license agreement let say also potential change business practice also broader impact industry matt talk little bit ndrc settlement intellectual property perspective provide framework company stay cross hair matt larson yeah certainly ndrc settlement interesting couple different way certainly provides roadmap company like qualcomm looking license standard essential patent china standard essential patent patent cover various technical standard wireless communication kind interoperability issue may company decide standard used across industry one device work talk another intellectual property required implement technical standard referred standard essential concern general concern much company able strangle market owning technology everyone us every device ndrc settlement set term company specifically qualcomm license standard essential patent three main provision think telling first potentially impactful people license chinese intellectual property turn required pay people take license whatever patent return almost obligatory agreement party paying license offset price intellectual property depending size two patent portfolio could large offset could small offset little bit protectionist measure bring rate company intellectual property china second point think important royalty base way patent licensed based percentage rate device component royalty base ndrc settlement said royalty base apply licensing percentage 65 end device previously company would license let say technology 2 3 entire handset 3g 4g lte patent would licensed anywhere 1 3 end device china said longer use entire end device royalty base 65 reducing potentially royalty payment model quite extreme position seen jurisdiction example united state couple area people moving end device royalty base smallest component practice technology royalty base moving entire phone chip thing like actually somewhat neutral guide post ndrc settlement third point think worth raising standard essential patent licensing settlement fact company longer allowed bundle standard essential patent call `` cadillac patent licensing deal got anand srinivasan matt larsontechnology cover standard license separately bell whistle patent portfolio company previously lumping together generating premium licensing entire portfolio ndrc settlement put end practice requiring unbundled depending look could drive price able charge patent looking attract licenser going change licensing dynamic negotiation dynamic people looking get return chinese intellectual property seems like disaggregation intellectual property seems mo ndrc philosophical difference intellectual property body across different jurisdiction operate china different mean would dramatically saying mean ieee thing ongoing `` okay pay chip percentage phone pay chip ought worth right ndrc appears similar tact well question dramatic difference china versus u versus eu intellectual property thing think good segue larger discussion policy specifically seeing disaggregation couple different front see delineation u contractual requirement company undertake respect standard essential patent license reasonable term license term negotiate separate term call catalog patent china ndrc interacted letting company large standard essential patent portfolio bully company taking license essential feature little bit protectionist approach whereas u kind kind built system way license negotiated looking generally trend play remember china introduction intellectual property strict enforcement recognition intellectual property developing area law china bulk patent protection introduced globalization economy come developing area contrast u intellectual property baked constitution holding private property anand srinivasan jennifer rierights ability monetize always central factor u government u market whereas china getting speed read somewhere someone called china patent system vibrant yet ﬂawed system think good good description getting speed still issue cultural perspective united state always focused protection monetization personal property think approach china focused individual barrier protection see play negotiation way intellectual property enforced licensed regulatory perspective jen purview different agency dramatic difference regulatory agency united state eu view versus china starting get lot regulatory agency involved ndrc mofcom certain factor also used judge whether certain industry company risk regulatory interest last question add pile fine matter changing practice ip structural risk well think like matt explained development ip enforcement exact place development antitrust enforcement china law went effect 2008 really new entire regulatory regime new developing called basically wild card mean new decision something new occurs new approach regulator study carefully see history develops think understanding compare eu u competition law backed load economic analysis basically generally meant protection healthy competitive market word geared toward protecting company competitor geared toward keeping healthy competitive market everybody chance challenge incumbent compete robustly maybe little bit different approach far chinese enforcer concern enforcement largely protect domestic firm protectionist foreign competition even seen concern expressed federal trade commission chair people well representative doj stating concerned way implemented china matter industrial policy rather protecting competition continue see develops viewing approach might taken expect industrial area chinese enforcer going looking robust domestic industry bit anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasan matt larsonwhat seen seen active tech software electronics auto part think might occur going forward term fine changing practice ip structural risk think depends jurisdiction see jurisdiction willing dole big fine including europe case u think see jurisdiction like china might interested changing practice controlling ip controlling royalty rate thing like really wo see wo price regulation occurring antitrust regulator u eu really practice whereas look like chinese regulator willing price regulate talk royalty need certain type patent seems like mo chinese regulatory agency protect china inc versus keep china inc versus inc versus purview eu u regulatory agency may protect consumer `` big bad corporation reasonable description look today yes mean still seeing thing develop china lot discussion cooperation amongst agency lot assistance development regime least yes okay matt want switch gear talk little bit offensive versus defensive patent done little bit work subject become common practice tech sector gathering ip defensive purpose simply sword nothing else annoyance suit may versus serious product development effort yeah right number different way company utilize intellectual property specifically patent protection seeing lot creativity innovation space well think offensive versus defensive distinction good one commonly referred industry using patent sword shield traditionally think patent think think defensively shield get patent product came intent purpose excluding competition using technology came secret sauce want use product want anybody else use misappropriate want reap benefit able sell much widget kind traditional defensive portfolio company invest r anand srinivasan matt larsoninventors submit disclosure lawyer protect stuff getting incorporated product strong defensive portfolio side company starting look massive investment r also pay annuity keep patent portfolio maintenance fee question investor start roi getting asset sitting property right like anything else license start get using patent offensively using sword either looking others industry might benefit technology maybe license stale intellectual property using somebody else might able monetize company focus certain market competitor using technology might able monetize always option selling part portfolio either getting kind license back company acquires patent sort selling fee lot different creative arrangement company gotten order generate kind return patent portfolio property asset like sword shield analogy talked theme theme little bit talked qualcomm little bit detail let jump marvell company predominantly hard disk drive controller space also ﬂedgling mobile chip business specifically focused integrated baseband application processor chip le 2 market share qualcomm mediatek space 3 3.5g side 4g side intellectual property caught cross hair litigation carnegie mellon supposedly carnegie mellon huge 1.5 billion case marvell back active little bit tell u little bit thing stand timeline dollar impact going certainly kind high level overview overall case early 2000s marvell looking design improvement implemented medium noise processor le improves ability detect medium hard drive detect information kind need know technology really something developed part professor carnegie mellon long story short carnegie mellon went marvell patent infringement suit wound steamrolling marvell trial additional damage tacked dust settled marvell looking 1.5 billion verdict judgment marvell obviously pay opportunity appeal question finding district anand srinivasan matt larsoncourt made jury implemented try pick judgment apart little bit one couple ground looking jury awarded damage based 0.50 per chip royalty basically looked last 10 year marvell chip found average chip revenue 4.40 per chip found profit 2.16 gave 0.50 per chip quarter profit good 0.50 royalty moving forward get dangerous price chip drop eats profit margin percentage hard 0.50 diﬃcult part judgment one upheld appeal appeal court say `` yes correct royalty still hook 0.50 marvell able save large portion verdict said large portion chip supposed pay royalty never enter u manufactured abroad sold abroad incorporated chip incorporated product abroad never entered u subject u patent protection issue appeal court said enough evidence presented first trial going scratch 900 million approximately half verdict send back court proceeding marvell looking 278 million verdict potential add additional damage district court proceeding also looking 0.50 royalty moving forward think got situation party way far apart settle trial marvell going pay 1.5 billion ballpark couple hundred million carnegie mellon business putting marvell street want continuing royalty want generate revenue intellectual property think place could potentially see deal company lot closer interesting part part sent back ip entity bearing stuff made overseas part jurisdiction sold overseas u company would inaudible saying make product overseas sold overseas u intellectual property patent somebody take make overseas sell overseas wo able enforce fair characterization fair character notion extra territoriality u patent protects u law question far contact foreign jurisdiction really escape long arm law speak anand srinivasan matt larsonand interesting question case close call carnegie mellon presented argument design occurred basically everything happened u shipped design overseas chip subject royalty marvell disagrees patent well action actually occurred u entitles royalty product see battle one playing interesting question guess party frequently litigation interesting lawyer interesting everyone chinese handset maker qualcomm said whether could escape u intellectual property making china selling china maybe would subject interesting bit nvidia another company bloomberg intelligence coverage company done detailed amount work claiming undergo serious transformation pc graphic company pc gaming company transformation transformation make gamer le pc company result pc weakness impact bill announced earnings tonight get little bit detail whether trend continuing aside company litigation samsung qualcomm arm imagination involved lay case u timeline event monies involved yes high level look charge screen let click notice nvidia focused mobile space right segment putting lot energy go ahead going back concept using patent portfolio sword looking see generate additional revenue patent portfolio one option company taking look technology protected seeing space operating seeing generate royalty people operating space le exactly nvidia done taken look samsung us graphic technology nvidia major competitor got samsung sourcing graphic qualcomm arm imagination nvidia going samsung galaxy device similar device able generate revenue three graphic competitor area operating anand srinivasan jennifer rieso approached samsung licensing negotiation broke usually happens company reached standstill litigation ensued going fairly aggressively looking resolve dispute pretty short timeline based litigation filed filed fast jurisdiction really quick time trial look case timeline screen notice one trial already happened another one way jury trial coming 2016 judgment issued feeling case samsung nvidia want reach deal trying check scale favor one person right samsung couple key victory trial already held seem favor samsung although long way go kind final judgment verdict rendered case looking timeline considering nvidia samsung key representative meeting next couple week discus settlement may possible could resolve dispute end year trial start kicking final decision looking nvidia overall strategy well got 1.5 billion license intel going dry 2017 indication nvidia want get deal samsung done time negotiate intel kind based part royalty rate provision license exactly analogous technology company negotiate ip get prior license industry practice think important nvidia try get good deal end 2016 think good goal deal 1 billion probably paid typical license four seven year samsung continues win get good posturing litigation could see come based leverage value case got want talk little bit micron minute reported interest tsinghua university asset management arm breakdown micron dram nand leader consolidating industry jen lead u u issue perspective regulatory body perspective sure course unlikely significant antitrust issue insignificant competitive overlap least enough competitive overlap company create issue regulator think sometimes see statement problem really getting confused may issue u front committee foreign investment united state often called cfius anand srinivasan matt larson anand srinivasancfius executive branch organization charged identifying potential national security risk posed foreign acquisition u business committee chaired secretary treasury includes representative number different u department agency including defense state commerce department department homeland security charged determining whether foreign acquisition investment pose security threat process particularly clear cut cfius review micron transaction seems likely reason transaction involves acquirer entity transaction automatically subject increase scrutiny usually mean scrutiny mean cfius would go full scrutiny 30 day plus 45 day review happen deal blocked due national security reason could lot mitigation measure put place deal allowed go oftentimes deal usually blocked oftentimes happen mitigation measure include significant u oversight ultimate merged entity mitigation measure pretty extreme diﬃcult acceptable buyer happens deal get abandoned possibility certainly get cfius review got matt ip issue mean little surprising micron reasonable ip portfolio commodity industry perhaps talk little bit ip positioning perhaps deserves cfius review yeah think one attractive thing micron patent portfolio got pretty sizable chunk asset u shy 19,000 u patent portfolio actually one cited portfolio semiconductor space seeing company referencing micron patent filing patent also got 4,000 international patent interesting arrangement company currently monetizing patent micron sold couple year ago sold 4,000 u patent company called round rock research engaged fairly large licensing campaign file 37 lawsuit patent acquired micron also executed licensing agreement large patent portfolio round one really got pretty strong network intellectual property asset could leveraged potential buyer got thank getting end sort discussion may one question jen pylon effect regulatory viewing particular company one regulator one region look qualcomm know time reached jennifer rie anand srinivasan matt larson anand srinivasansettlement four regulatory agency started looking fair right well might think fair mean think couple factor weigh first increasingly global economy talking chip really global product talking emerging market becoming active enforcer increased need international cooperation seeing think actually end day good thing lot international cooperation amongst world antitrust enforcer particular korean ftc attacked lot importance international cooperation entered memorandum understanding 15 competition authority see u eu chinese regulator talking lot sharing knowledge happens interested protecting consumer country talk happening different investigation learn going look whether could effect conduct within jurisdiction end day sharing cooperation currently occurring might good thing long run business enforcement agency come together become aligned way treat antitrust business conduct certainty comfort business actually operating globally conduct whether may may violate law effect good also good thing slightly different differing agenda ip perspective right think similarity one reason seeing similar issue company similar intellectual property asset different jurisdiction file patent u key patent seek protection globally meanwhile patent law vary slightly jurisdiction jurisdiction generally similar approach jen pointed country apt get involved actual term agreement whereas others little bit hand party differ court system actually get detail nailed seeing little bit variability difference patent law approach resolve dispute matt larson anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasangot thank matt folk end standardized presentation reminder want ask question use q panel right slide pause moment look q matt talk amd quick minute two patent portfolio positioning thought amd yeah certainly amd pretty interesting portfolio right sitting 5,000 patent think little bit fewer 5,000 patent another 1,200 1,500 pipe lot amd patent activity happened right around 2000s kind 1997 2002 era somewhat stagnant since big portion electric digital data maybe another 20 semiconductor seems pretty unique portfolio able monetize fairly successfully 2010 samsung paid 283 million payment essentially settle dispute entered intel part overall litigation strategy intel wound paying amd sizable chunk dropping lawsuit although explicitly royalty would imagine large portion attributable intellectual property amd kind developed mean small sizable strong patent portfolio able monetize fairly successfully got jen given lot interest chinese entity late desire build semiconductor food chain homeland explain cfius get involved versus agency regional clearance might required well cfius going get involved time entity acquiring u asset always review going step going take look think warrant review review impose mitigation measure always going involved essentially entity acquiring investing u asset far region going depend whether test triggered say different jurisdiction sort framework transaction filed antitrust authority authority given chance review usually reach certain threshold certain size certain amount asset within country certain amount sale country depends product question sold matt larson anand srinivasan matt larson jennifer riegot matt since talking semi review intel apple sort portfolio really quickly give u skinny two yeah certainly apple taking interesting approach mean got large investment intellectual property got lot patent fashion big innovator certainly done lot innovation today nobody disputing apple term monetizing portfolio take interesting approach frequently target intellectual property lawsuit like using pejorative patent troll go apple want quick payday apple le concerned monetizing patent offensive sword way using shield apple taken lot effort reduce royalty payment talking standard essential patent apple take position royalty lower based smaller percentage device smallest component possible higher royalty dig pocket apple huge innovator also made lot step adverse say qualcomm ericsson nokia company really looking monetize innovation got recent passing law `` ip troll help industry regard make worse licensors owner ip think yet seen still kicking around provision bill going got good team bloomberg intelligence actually following kind recent activity surrounding bill going tough anytime adjust patent litigation system winner loser really kind depends final bill going look like think little ambitious think able pas litigation bill law lawyer control litigation seems suspect really going deter whole lot business practice see actual legislation come yeah also wanted raise talking lot ip tech wanted raise something else federal trade commission cover lot different industry area antitrust sort move ... different time focus move ... focused lot recently healthcare industry event april enforcer world ftc enforcer speaking panel one thing said moving looking standard essential patent making priority matt larson anand srinivasanand think tell u company owns license standard essential patent going kind come looking glass u ftc going forward next couple year made really clear something focusing yeah something focusing seeing lot court case lot company rather negotiating kind behind closed door going court saying `` alright want know reasonable royalty willing fight seeing big dispute apple ericsson focus issue ericsson tcl lot kind emerging area low think party looking court side ﬂesh really see chip falling got last call question wrap okay want take time thank
