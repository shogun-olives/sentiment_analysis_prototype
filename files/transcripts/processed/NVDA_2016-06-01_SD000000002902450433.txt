good morning everyone vivek arya bank america merrill lynch semiconductor team absolutely delighted welcome everyone technology conference especially delighted colette kress cfo nvidia kick semiconductor part session also joined arnab chanda shawn simmons investor relation team thought would start discussion q open question welcome colette thank joining u thank much maybe start thought could go different segment week computex show already announced pascal gtx product think formal unveiling product week news competitor amd also could take step back give u sense pc gaming market done last four five year pascal mean shape next year might look like business colette kress vivek arya colette kress sure representation gaming market big part nvidia gaming business represents 50 60 overall revenue size last couple year tremendous success existing architecture maxwell term driving overall market gaming seen growth rate probably 35 last couple year term cagr finished q1 fiscal year 2017 continuation growth business grew 17 mentioned also announced right end q1 newest architecture pascal pascal announced two new card two card 1080 1070 begun selling received astounding review reviewer well gamers extremely enthusiastic lot significant improvement term performance even end card last generation well price point thing prior architecture excited unveil work term computex continue talk talk underlying hardware work around ecosystem ecosystem around gaming overall design work vr work term sdks software platform help make gaming continue even better yesterday ebay saw card selling like 1,200 1,800 right two three time remember last time semiconductor product selling two three time list price question enough supply customer need right supply hurdle supply limitation really excited people enthused term founder addition coming first 1080s 1070s expected extremely extremely popular supply quite shortly aic card market quite shortly short period time founder card seeing lot unique price point ready aics shortly vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kress got lastly saw amd also announced competing architecture polaris started pricing card low 199 seen competitive landscape anything surprised sort expected going set pricing product yes surprise term seen really started path overall pascal trying create arena card essentially every part pc market enabling gaming also making sure enabling vr every stage performance card far extremely well received particularly price point continue see pascal come card probably enable performance almost every single level pascal continues got upgrade opportunity think lot time try simplify discussion growth term unit content remember analyst day said last five year 20 compounded growth rate pc gaming sort 9 unit 11 content look next three four year see two trend shaped individually unit side understand probably upgrade opportunity stronger pascal asp side thing card right course pricing new product better could talk unit asp trend think would helpful sure referring discussed investor day back early part spring result seen lot discussion 35 growth largest driver business overall tam improvement tam growth seen period time continuing benefit u believe big part expanding overall tam term bringing gamers market gamers come market based game available better production value game better accessibility broadband around world brought board also seen expansion esports vivek arya colette kressthe expansion esports literally put gaming arena form entertainment social platform people online together expanding overall user big part overall growth seen unit continue increase market aside people looking overall pc exactly grown also seen increase term asp necessarily u pricing different level gamers coming experiencing gaming much higher production term card buy seen continued move buying higher higher end card game become available pascal architecture another opportunity realize higher end gaming look opportunity upgrade think installed base probably 100 million gamers see 80 million one geforce experience downloading thing need game term driver configuration 80 million still small percentage currently current architecture maxwell moving pascal definitely opportunity upgrade see think term higher end card expect probably continue going forward well fair think somebody buying let say 99 card content part 99 card know whether 20 25 something range gamer buying 299 399 card content part card much greater percentagewise used reference regarding card market card consider jewel inside card representing chip memory key thing supply revenue u working card market supply rest different component may incorporated card still majority content matter price point inside card probably continuation seen addition coming founder also unique component really bring higher level component addition regular aic market term founder addition goal really provide right card right type gamer expect u earn historically vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kress role vr play already seeing direct indirect benefit still come think think early phase vr believe think vr next generation gaming absolutely see going forward goal enable vr across wide spectrum individual individual term mainstream vr player enthusiast type gamers well also vr move professional nowhere stage say vr already good enough mean significant amount work done improve focus providing card level also working software component engineer vr experience continue better think early stage bonus top see term gaming look vr ask quantify everything nth detail look trend whether rise number gamers increased attention esports whether look content game opportunity competitive position fair think still midteens kind growth opportunity nvidia next two three year think perception strong cycle sort peak rate cycle console getting later part side growth also slow pc gaming see anything slows pc gaming next two three year pc gaming extremely healthy entertainment market differs quite bit existing console type business console relatively long cycle necessarily one change go buy console stay many many many year level current production value game right lot gamers see continue expand term people coming online game really feed type game game developer building overall market see continuation seen great position vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kressour pascal architecture even allows come board experience great part pc gaming friend esports type thing see changing think healthy position think good space right new pascal architecture got last question gaming one trend remember investor day discussion emerging market still big part penetration obviously developed market anything special emerging market expand penetration level good question people tend look u european country understand key trend asia pac area unique see expansion pc gaming correct many part world broadband access term western world come much faster pace really surrounded pc excuse pc versus u division sometimes type form factor focus enabling different level asia pac area may seed initial thing taken place western world many year ago different market see asia pac continue fuel exactly done already existing market got one last question competition come frequently investor perception new amd thing different better architecture also adopted new 14 nanometer 16 nanometer finfet technology see marketplace difference whether term pricing different competitively dominant share market right making case easier u take share nvidia right point right much better point seen anything different competitive landscape say different last several year think nvidia think way chosen approach strategic aspect selling gaming market really transformed platform type approach vivek arya colette kressit chip bigger better chip resource engineering horsepower absolutely build best technology surrounded working across entire ecosystem software developer overall gamers giving ability involved community gamers continuing expand get nvidia term sale platform community overall understanding gaming whole get chip seen term strategy anywhere else nvidia say change primarily nvidia would say anywhere else gamers pretty much stay nvidia based commitment continue test boundary performance eﬃciency card provide think see got moving onto data center business one star recent earnings call could maybe take step back help u understand segment business whether hyperscale versus computing versus enterprise key application address sort quick intro business sure data center business little bit different seeing gaming side gaming take place really trying enable graphic need talking data center used using gpu accelerate computing key component computing platform move forward part data center business eight year eight year term computing using gpu accelerate many application computing several large supercomputer across world one part one segment data center business second piece also focus last two gtcs discussed term continued rise deep learning deep learning framework artificial intelligence new era using deep neuronets actually help artificial intelligence framework using deep learning build artificial intelligence many key application primarily right lot hyperscales breadth depth hyperscales using deep learning many different type application number three also place cloud computing position gpu cloud leveraged streaming vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kressenvironment partitioned thing one many using overall gpu three business underneath data center growing quite nicely continue scale understanding use gpu performance programmability power eﬃciency make probably form factor people using deep learning deep learning training going continue focus expanding enterprise industry real industry data essential understanding data serve end customer key focus driver underlying data center business expect continue revenue reported business think surprised everyone impact one two large customer think new baseline business actually sustainable even grow level yes actually watched discussion last couple year rollout deep learning really started lot research institution higher ed really focused new framework see every single hyperscale across globe focused deep learning really situation breadth depth project together overall driving growth know continue project rollouts across hyperscales also movement enterprise well take big market fast grow size something think early stage right deep learning u really understand scope fast could overall move excited progress really right platform right hardware right development platform enabled lot deep learning well visibility conceptually kind business understand lot trial lot thing going already somewhat good sense next one two three quarter might look like business vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kressit different business selling gaming card right gaming card one type sale one one type gamer case data center business definitely start understanding problem trying solve understanding architecture data center assist long relationship relationship still yet go build across industry really long relationship cycle seeing continue roll across many different workload many different project good visibility say good list people working yes okay provide good visibility good list people working thought would try google recently announced tensorflow product said replace cpu gpus lot headline around first sort claim true somebody like google going design product eliminates need gpus kind thing good get good understanding technology surrounding deep learning different part deep learning deep learning training really taking data working throwing deep neural network powerful performance necessary requiring see today form factor would gpus actually training environment see also use seeing inference standpoint well taking exactly algorithm developed deep learning framework using new data also entering overall network inference primarily used cpu easier form configuration maybe asics fpgas manner also starting see gpus leveraged piece vivek arya colette kress vivek aryaso overall ability use tpu deep learning training probably overall intention mainly overall inference market continuing work building pascal architecture came training also gpus inference well surprise someone would focus going complete deep learning process training side inference see sort see widespread industry phenomenon think seeing different market smartphones example apple able design processor right able design good processor hurt market merchant silicon smartphone processor understand different market google prevent facebook baidu somebody else overall deep learning even acceleration market using many different form factor quite anything new use built asic could easily done question performance well master overall performance something able continue excel based overall resource development see unlikely much custom asic design done actually challenging amount investment necessary build seen continued outperform coming new performance new power eﬃciency going forward think expect think different market single use may term mobile many way solve lot investment necessary would really preclude lot people really starting part business know harder pinpoint exact growth rate new market starting develop let say somebody say next three four year capex cloud guy would grow let say 10 15 year colette kress vivek arya colette kressthan market opportunity fair think could grow kind rate asking forecast trying say investor think quantifying opportunity grow faster growth capex cloud player yes think cloud player focused data center throughput focused improving workload serving consumer could looked capex important part future capex investment one component piece really break overall computing architecture material part improving throughput think architecture going forward tend look market data type workload would best suited deep learning focus look following data seen lot research big data firm also looking deep learning possibility think bad way look break capex term looking invest within let pause see question audience gaming talk automotive business okay keep going automotive another strong area growth nvidia much infotainment much like putting seed place autonomous driving advanced driver assist system forth think question say time dedication research think infotainment business infotainment business 8 10 year working automotive premium car manufacturer infotainment system see 10 million car road infotainment system car overall hit road strategic focus build upon relationship saw key need taking exactly understood data center solve diﬃcult challenge automotive company looking way vivek arya colette kressautonomous driving significant amount computational power going necessary understand everything surround car serve set instruction many form factor ada continuing advanced ada handwritten man year worth algorithm written order address market focus using deep learning using center computing platform open scalable build toward autonomous driving focus right absolutely autonomous driving building many car manufacturer tier 1 working probably 80 different example tier 1 startup research happening term autonomous driving majority revenue today course still infotainment world right starting term development contract likely next 12 month platform drive px platform autonomous driving production set car look competitive landscape automotive automotive semiconductor top mind one growth area people thought would grow actually growing see though competitive landscape like nxp bring diverse set product safety microcontrollers whatnot right broad set product typical smart traditional smartphone company like qualcomm intel approaching market smartphone mindset let worry processor let also think touchscreen controller power management putting lte baseband look automotive opportunity see nvidia spectrum enough growth computing part car drive growth next year hard look historically space say really talking space developed term yet car term digitalization key important part move forward right look average car 50 different microprocessor within car competition place overall play may single function type thing focus say overall compute power central repository absolutely necessary going take time build scale highest vivek arya colette kress vivek aryalevel autonomous driving next future transformation front u necessary focusing single microprocessor single function evolution see going focused creating connectivity central platform inside connect different camera sensor radar lidar may come car going forward algorithm deal using deep learning framework everything training data outside car taking information data receive car better create information going need moving forward player different form factor thing may incremental today looking going necessary full autonomous driving car future got maybe minute left talk financials seen strong expansion gross margin last year much business moving away legacy competitive pc market product mix shift key trend gross margin expansion sustainable continue see room growth gross margin think focus output gross margin underlying driver mix key component whether higher priced think platform sale value delivering often development platform layer development tool development library software come much overall product platform one specialized market go continuing work allowed u achieve higher gross margin mix product continue move closer product mix driven higher margin still going focus go forward see enterprise data center business higher gross margin company average gaming 50 big inﬂuence definitely term gross margin still going concentration know perfect mix fast gross margin may grow colette kress vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kressall right understand next year reset rolloff royalty think known understood let say two three year would shock see nvidia get 60 gross margin referring intel licensing agreement final stage existing agreement knowledge term way go fine assume may zero would impact renew overall gross margin aside focus key area large tam whether data center whether gaming absolutely opportunity gross margin go higher 60 sure good exact number would sit commit anything business prevent nvidia getting 60 always factor come conservatism yes everything portfolio company average could higher amount thing still work term getting focus right know automotive example typically lower gross margin business something expand gross margin exact process selling chip inside selling lot development platform development service working driveworks term autonomous driving value huge opportunity u revenue well term gross margin expansion q unidentified participant colette kress q unidentified participant colette kress q vivek arya colette kressquestions answer could comment intel agreement breadth depth agreement term access ip patent extend ip patent 2017 carry right beyond 2017 direction term license license portfolio refer capture period capture period end first quarter next fiscal year still access even capture period wo access anything new past capture period point leverage develop file new capture period finding anything filed patent period anything developed term fine clarity line term detail think easy say q1 anything new put true patent would captured term cost structure also think one important aspect strong control cost last year litigation expense litigation samsung qualcomm settled opportunity take invest growth opportunity think sort help actually fall bottom line prior year significant investment worked litigation samsung qualcomm peak though probably first half last year getting ready itc case time continuing wind lot high expense seen relatively consistent ﬂat overall expense base quite time really making appropriate investment see necessary one bringing pascal life today also term path data center new business well q vivek arya colette kress q vivek arya colette kress q vivek aryabut continue look eﬃciencies thing rolling order manage overall operating margin company growth like see really going focus continue go forward operating margin expansion making right investment assured continue expand margin going forward got look fable company able achieve 30 operating margin bad target think think nvidia think focusing u platform company u focus operating profitability right thing think talking pretty big market front u experience overall leveraged infrastructure definitely enabled u really attack market need make sure make investment also really achieve tam front u balance fast think pleased right perspective right sitting 25 last year grown 470 basis point moved quite well pleased output production engineering investment made continue focus continue focus profitability last two quick sort question gaming product also used data center accelerator classification thing small thing fixating much really small thing type researcher wanting dabble gpus easily go online get one delivered may one gaming card may one titan may start workstation may buy one one good way get started remember one gpus programmable come programmable set get started something see data center architectural design term sure researcher gaming well researching deep learning using gpu multiple speaker see big cloud guy going best buy buying lot end product colette kress q vivek arya colette kress q vivek arya colette kress okay last one pc oem business obviously come low level sort ﬂatten continues go insignificant part business right material part used material part looking number le 10 overall size revenue business people need overall discrete gpu pc business economic standpoint lose money go back design win design win back forth overall pc market may growth market near future either case probably level follow connection overall pc market play economic sense probably highly correlate overall pc market great right end time thank everyone thank colette really appreciate time thank
