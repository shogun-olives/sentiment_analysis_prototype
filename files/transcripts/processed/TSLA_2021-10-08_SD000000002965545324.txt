incredible work past year get well done record vehicle delivery already reported see pretty mean think might fastest large manufactured object grown like yes certainly one fastest perhaps fastest look like good chance maintaining future really dependent supplier challenge basically get chip hopefully chip shortage alleviate soon feel confident able maintain something like least 50 quite model 3 became premium vehicle globally premium vehicle got arrested one point claiming 5,000 week literally anyway great think model best selling vehicle kind globally think exceed model 3 think got good chance vehicle revenue next year think quite likely selling vehicle kind numerically 2023 basically need olsen get online berlin get online reach volume production think going happen cash term free cash ﬂow generation obviously tough year back think looking little dicey say least 2017 2018 want go back got thing looking really good think see continued strong cash ﬂow generation especially multiply unit volume time autonomy increased eﬃciency factory think time see manufacturer make electric vehicle eventually manufacturer make autonomous vehicle think tesla open licensing autonomy think autonomy significant lifesaver preventive injury technology think morally right license manufacturer would like use ... course made lot progress cost reduction despite average selling price actually going significantly introduction model 3 model much lower priced car managed still decently well gross margin getting average price gross margin diﬃcult managed yes good goal really make car affordable possible seeing significant cost pressure supply chain increase vehicle price least temporarily hope actually reduce price time make affordable yes unfortunately expedite mean sheer amount money spending ﬂying part around world great hopefully temporary need lot battery hence battery day shirt mean going need lot battery going combination battery supplier supplier discussion supplier asked outright going put business something like many cell want make supply u affordable price buy limit like oh okay like want yes increase 100 sound good basic plan really going order lot mean ordered lot battery supplier basically telling supplier literally go much make take prioritize battery vehicle use excess cell powerwall megapack time think demand stationary storage going least high demand vehicle sustainable energy primarily solar wind intermittent wind blow time sun shine time obviously need battery buffer power fundamental pillar sustainable energy future basically solar wind primary stationary battery electric transport 3 sustainable energy future long sun shining people ask fusion like idea way think totally doable giant fusion reactor sky show every morning zero maintenance like sound like good deal always catch little bit sunlight power earth shockingly small amount land needed power earth like couple hundred mile couple hundred mile solar panel power entire united state like okay hard believe calculated needed one square mile battery think like wow lot battery one square mile battery crazy got plan reduce cost per kilowatt hour battery supplier similar plan really supplemental supplier make cell make cell use fundamental good tesla think many year accelerate sustainable energy fundamental think way think value tesla able accelerate sustainable energy year good hence need grow quickly got three new factory giga shanghai done incredible job giga shanghai exceeds fremont production actually like give special hand tesla china team best quality lowest cost also low drama great said continuing expand fremont operation expect hopefully increase fremont output 50 still make old model x made fremont kind make sense especially vehicle production least continent consumer otherwise also good environment shipping car several thousand mile basic idea vehicle customer approximately least also great progress building giga texas right giga berlin brandenburg hand team well factory cell production well really kind raw material car really really big yes mean thing like unit pentagon basically let see impact report lot think interesting stuff impact report go quite lot detail thing tesla certainly company try hard right thing respect try hard right thing respect always succeed looking company say company really trying right thing tesla okay really tried okay mean anyway mentioning got three part sustainable energy future solar wind think primarily solar main source energy sustainable energy energy general need store energy stationary battery pack need electric vehicle electric airplane boat whatnot yes great yes average life cycle emission u.s. going get better move sustainable grid electric vehicle obviously move fully sustainable energy economy want get quickly possible sooner better carbon tax mean hell people say like oh comment would benefit tesla like yes would hurt spacex carbon tax really needed see battery material definitely cyclable burning gas co2 extremely stable molecule mar atmosphere primarily co2 billion year extremely stable soon people worry methane worry much methane methane quickly break co2 methane stable molecule co2 extremely stable course recycle battery material think battery essentially ore either get lithium nickel various constituent battery rock battery much better get battery battery basically ore. tesla already started recycling lot company going basically pay recycling battery seeing increased extreme weather event like wildfire austin massive snowstorm turned power actually austin snowstorm house electric light power heating internet could actually even get food store could get food store food went several day however solar plus powerwall car would light electricity actually starlink internet internet thing need prepper basically doom day come could helpful factory safety done made huge improvement factory safety 18 better industry average great always tough safety ramp production line start battery elon muskbut steady state injury naturally decline people get used iron issue seeing excellent battery safety tesla goal saving factory earth ai day think important change fundamental perception tesla people sort think tesla car company yes made car ai part tesla well understood tesla much software company hardware company also chip designed full inference computer designing training computer going able think eﬃcient neural net training computer world far seeing tremendous response daily applicant role see basically ai day ai applicant increased dramatically thought successful day team great job yes going important part future obviously one function obviously mixed thought ai going watch ai danger happening either way guess try best make sure positive good ai hopefully yes excited announce moving headquarters austin texas clear though continuing expand activity california matter sort tesla leaving california said intention actually increase output fremont giga nevada 50 hitting side bowl mean go fremont factory jammed mean jammed like whoa first went like like kid parent shoe ridiculous like tiny giant factory like ca like put stuff tough people afford house lot people come far away take taken far possible limit big scale bay area austin factory like five minute airport 15 minute downtown going create ecological paradise colorado river going great emphasize gain continuing expand california significantly even texas go question question answer okay cybertruck production begin rate happen well year constant struggle part supply clear like five extra product would change vehicle output basically limited multiple supply chain shortage like many time chip lot supply chain shortage really would matter like cybertruck anything would able make semi particular need lot cell need lot cell lot chip got enough otherwise pointless think likely see cybertruck stock production next year reach volume production 2023 hopefully also producing semi new roadster well severe supply chain shortage optimistic case see stock split well maybe yet maybe consider stock split point future think quite quite yet see 4680 battery cell production texas think see 4680 production texas year making 4680s california pilot plant big plant normal standard like capable 10 gigawatt hour year mile away vehicle factory fremont basically factory able make enough cell giga texas scale production model want emphasize like point factory able start making car reach production typically year considered fast take longer least tesla land take longer build factory reach volume production factory built like shanghai built factory 11 month get production took year expect something similar start production year deliver comfortably deliver car giga texas year model y wo reach production probably end next year also expect reach high level production 4680 cell giga texas next year well factory man hard build factory said many time prototype easy production hard like whatever like 1 inspiration 99 perspiration think production like 99 perspiration think mean might start scouting location next year think lot berlin austin expanding china expanding fremont nice thing like least factory europe factory china factory north america least factory product continent customer great like one biggest challenge q3 get enough chip like huge chip shortage challenge got stuck panama mean suez canal course thing expect thing happen know probably get new factory location start investigate next year maybe make decision tesla plan offer dividend currently plan dividend kind feel like time company offer dividend kind cresting hill usually run thing invest internally run thing invest internally long shot provide quarterly update energy along automotive yes mean need make progress energy yes year limited like said chip shortage chip go stationary battery pack car prioritize car need inverter solar kind thing year good guide progress energy think next year probably good guide start providing update think people would interpret correctly opposed explain either short car energy pick car right yes model 2 car model 2 3 mean e. model 3 try get going call model e ford run sue said let call model 3 3 x instead know anyway gigafactory getting bigger iteration gigafactories get bigger iteration think yes get advanced eﬃcient looking sort taking first principle approach manufacturing want look volumetric eﬃciency factory average speed factory kind like rocket equation delta v like exhaust velocity time log start end mass ratio think something similar factory also think like chip like make chip get chip making bigger bringing thing closer together increasing clock speed actually think tremendous opportunity factory actually bring thing closer together increase cycle time clock speed actually think tremendous opportunity improve eﬃciency factory tesla competitive advantage manufacturing cause electric eventually car autonomous thing hardest think sort match tesla copy manufacturing think advantage tesla yes limiting factor growth engineering yes really like factory stamping amazing engineer hard got basically recruit people got train right way take time like sometimes company think hire anyone engineering degree slap together get amazing stuff case often adding engineer program make go slower excellence engineer matter tremendously huge difference engineering talent boggles mind wonder today like nikola tesla applied tesla would even give interview sure would like obviously concern like think could better job vetting resume really looking evidence exceptional ability like whether somebody graduated particular school whatever like three bullet point evidence exceptional ability say wow read three bullet point great approach okay actually big fan original vw sort bus really cool really seen new one yes mean think time tesla make basically major variant vehicle one every significant category think yes right guess people see slide right need read question yes think actually making rapid progress solar roof lar general energy general got kind couple year desperately trying make model 3 reach volume production moved everyone anywhere company could possibly work model 3 working model 3 hand deck know couple year got save model 3 fails whole company dead could move everyone solar every help model 3 couple year behind think making rapid progress solar roof particular new homebuilder obviously eﬃcient way get solar roof put put roof instead like retrofit obviously fundamentally expensive solar roof new home relationship number new homebuilder expect gather significant momentum going campaign kind like well updating want mtv want solar think actively asking new home development well solar roof powerwall generate power help stabilize rest grid using powerwall partnership utility like thing think people need appreciate lot electricity production need occur move electric vehicle future two home car electric power electricity usage approximately double local power production home battery battery got buffer power otherwise solar without battery cause massive wave grid battery stabilize grid battery act collectively stabilize whole grid software developed think first going go houston australia going think quite compelling really need sustainable energy future address electricity homeowner level essential still prosperous future utility electric power approximately double transition heating electric well approximately triple lot work local level electricity distribution utility utility better expand got solar battery homeowner level tesla solar battery mean power matter utility shuts reason still power austin blizzard like staying friend house solar roof battery sitting dark cold like okay really brings home need solar roof battery anyway think going see think solar roof see massive growth year come 10.2 inaudible yes much inside baseball fsd going start rolling fsd beta customer perfect safety driven record tomorrow night midnight california time see go want cautious rollout q unidentified participant elon muskif looking good like little 1,000 people perfect score start giving people 99 98 97 forth probably cutoff like 60 know got willing people extremely conscientious driver beta program looking really good actually drove friend house staying austin quite far away quite complicated drive car took way friend house gigafactory intervention perfect drive yes right question guess take yes audience sure yell whatever ... inaudible need mining battery basically got extend ﬂeet ﬂeet car gigantic 2 billion car truck use world lot annual global capacity vehicle 100 million year roughly kind make sense like car truck tend last 20 year go junkyard important important statistic bear mind like even car vehicle electric tomorrow still take 20 year change ﬂeet think people like see lot noise sort story electric vehicle ﬂeet matter basically round nothing look total ﬂeet vehicle earth electric car point think still well 1 ﬂeet know probably 30 30 40 year yes bad yes yes think clarify thing sometimes misunderstood lithium extremely plentiful one plentiful thing earth rare hard avoid lithium said dig bunch rock lithium would hard time seawater basically lithium salt salt little bit salt pretty much everywhere lithium everywhere issue also lithium like maybe 1 2 cell actual thing matter cathode well actually higher vehicle use cathode people think cathode q unidentified participant elon musk q unidentified participant elon musk q unidentified participant elon musk q unidentified participantno cobalt used phone laptop use nickel nickel higher energy density vehicle standard range vehicle stationary storage think move iron cathode iron also extremely plentiful nickel rare 10 100x iron nickel moving chemistry sort finally point competitive range combined eﬃcient powertrain think vast majority battery future iron based see shortage question making equipment kind process cell pack inaudible factory factory like way think many year tesla first factory mean like see one dead would cool know got like 40 hopefully dead basically would great inaudible safety score oh great question know actually yes know check check think mine get turned yes pick one way safety score calculation obviously imperfect try emphasize much beta alpha safety score calculation going get lot change yes expect improve accuracy substantially time really early stage algorithm inaudible anything grid system yes fact tesla number project tesla texas tesla texas got large battery project believe houston area yes houston area inaudible 100 megawatt elon musk q unidentified participant elon musk q unidentified participant elon musk q unidentified participant elon musk q unidentified participant sorry 100 megawatt yes 100 megawatt houston area talking ercot major installation tesla megapack system actually really great dealing power ﬂuctuations look power usage varies dramatically day get particularly summer day winter day got electric heating electric cooling going see big spike hotter cold day even day see big variance like order power power grid sort energy storage buffer resilient worst second worst day worst year obviously great sort throw peaker plant peaker plant reliant natural gas people start using natural gas heating kind happened houston people using gas heat peaker plant gas like okay battery would work great tesla megapacks waste power would gone target capacity megapack factory target capacity megapack factory actually know target capacity big 40 gigawatt hour okay 40 gigawatt hour yes actually example expanding also expanding manufacturing california california opened big mega pack production facility inaudible elon musk q unidentified participant elon musk q unidentified participant elon musk sorry inaudible inaudible tesla insurance yes like degree insurance regulatory labyrinth insane like designed hard feeling guy know certainly diﬃcult zillion application wait bunch time get come long complicated lot state state state state processing application state across country state also different regulation ca actually legally allowed offer insurance every state got adjust software different every state basically complicated think offering texas soon like maybe month something next week great phoned friend yes tesla insurance go live texas next week knew month california going upgrading version california want kind insurance insurance cost based driving history like right way currently allowed california reason trying get permission regulator allowed give accurate score like thing want hopefully know probably country next year aspirationally goal inaudible really getting weed definitely going making cybertruck probably atv atv interesting design challenge atvs pretty dangerous want make atv least dangerous atv going atv well miss least dangerous atv really low center gravity battery pack low think thing suspension make really hard roll thing atvs roll bad thing happen q unidentified participant elon muskgoing atv wo roll would cool got one cybertruck okay take one last question yes inaudible electric plane yes yes lot plate electric plane yes dying decade honestly got got quite fish fry maybe one day electric plane battery energy density improving every year important metric get sell energy density around hour per kilogram pack eﬃciency around hour per kilogram electric plane start get interesting fun problem work point lot next year going focus thing get right maybe one day right thanks everyone tuning thanks great
