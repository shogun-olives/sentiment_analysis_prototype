start abruptly live stream microsoft name brent bracelin senior research analyst piper sandler covering cloud software analytics space tuning bend oregon joined harsh kumar senior research analyst covering semiconductor tuning memphis tennessee pleased three distinguished speaker microsoft joining morning doug burger technical fellow one leading active researcher computer architecture welcome doug david carmona general manager artificial intelligence microsoft jonathan nielsen finance director microsoft investor relation online live streaming point time welcome team ai microsoft thank much thank thank brent dive q maybe let start brief description background kind role microsoft maybe location joining u morning doug burger brent bracelin david carmona brent bracelindoug want kick thing sure hi good morning everyone brent thank giving u opportunity participate doug burger formerly researcher computer architecture professor university texas 10 year running research group built cpu processor new type hardware architecture silicon moved microsoft 2008 started research group computer architecture microsoft research team built number new thing one catapult fpga platform form basis measure smart networking accelerates application bing actually large scale distributed system built use chip year three quarter ago company asked move team azure really start new direction cloud grows hardware innovation full stack innovation become important recently take active role ai architecture system really focus ai infrastructure hardware low software level great good david yeah connected redmond actually connecting probably short walking distance oﬃce useless day could anywhere yes redmond joined microsoft almost 20 year ago background software development attracted time microsoft famous window right actually attracted microsoft developer tool like dna microsoft held variety role connecting engineering sign business always connected around developer business used lead business visual studio visual studio online azure tool like five six year ago noticed something changing industry new software called ai made transition ai lead ai innovation team business side microsoft good doug burger brent bracelin doug burger david carmonai forgot brent sorry forgot mention bellevue probably couple mile away david multiple speaker well power team right meeting virtually cool tied kind current seat ai kind frame discussion reﬂect back last year would say kind landmark ai innovation occurred either across silicon system new class ai model landmark thing investor kind pay attention last kind year david go ahead let start technology recapping build let go last week right last week unsure go detail today one key thing ﬂew little bit radar probably heard term ai supercomputer announced last week change behind u implication far beyond hardware key thing saw ai supercomputer train massive model massive mean billion parameter order million parameter cool yeah get better le accuracy really meant key change certainly something top changing way develop ai ai platform something clear people company develop ai model basis realized massive model generic traditional customized vertical model specific scenario bring interesting motion market company embracing massive model customizing model particular scenario trust therefore bringing like ai company certainly one thing would highlight top ensure provide let mention another thing also form last week think important say concept autonomous system doug burgerso chip everybody also shooting autonomous assistance autonomous driving lot case forgetting autonomous system much broader last week announced bill first preview every developer access autonomous system platform go beyond motion control target robotics thing like process optimization thing like machine calibration lot scenario much current situation company address another one like doug sure add top lot know pretty great complete let see couple thing might underscore particular ai supercomputer announcement really david said size model growing much much faster think u predicted mean growing round number 10x per year growth rate far surpasses moore law active also disrupted 50 year giant model seen far bigger train break towards able train semi supervised especially transformer natural language year half ago really turned field domain problem problem racing build supercomputer train model reasonable amount time day week month disruptive look capability thing able drive term language capability like david said seeing think rapid infusion ai across product family obviously supercomputer expensive infrastructure train large model different people built past train serve model giant serving real time also challenging expensive think transition really think industry grasped yet appreciated fast going drive capability ai different infrastructure need 10x requirement go architecture sound like unique thing create ai supercomputer want go back comment made around size model kind changing bleeding edge kind 1 used case think size model moving kind data bound compute bound scenario prevalent maybe appreciate outside looking david carmona brent bracelin david carmona yeah doug take two used case think separate clearly right one 1 company great massive model believe every company planet interesting thing actually building model model mentioning generic centrally train model company deep expertise access compute capability customizing model need give example way actually microsoft transitioned broader broader ai approach oﬃce creating model dynamic creating model bing creating model culture centralized creation massive model team customize feature oﬃce like auto reply like document summarization coming customizing model without requiring massive infrastructure expertise two angle would separate david think going silo centralized larger model accelerating feature like big benefit time market new ai functionality advanced ai function would say several right first let go one one least would mention three first one super obvious skill right art model everybody access example level almost would say researcher phd creating model ca reuse one super important say lot democratization ai industry second one data model trained initially huge amount data central case trending index web right huge amount data adding customizing model need big amount data example case dynamic custom train model within additional data coming case thing like customer churn identification custom train model delta domain right interesting third thing would say compute power customization using technical transfer learning need train doug burger david carmona doug burgermodel scratch need huge amount infrastructure required train model initially doug forgetting thing take think captured well would add one point asked model size think largest model train billion talked little bit announcement view front bad wave would call research really pushing envelope system algorithmic technique data management find model capability take one quick size radically large six month ago model used kind throughout infrastructure really think bimodal distribution like 1 thing everything else whole space moving fast new thing biggest thing edge thing huge one year ago kind empowering product think fast happening think note mean take year build custom hardware silicon build system deploy need make major change hardware platform year yet huge shift le two year old still pushing envelope rate growth yeah kind whatever whatever get drive model fortunately made lot investment past benefiting second comment would make think microsoft strategy perspective go onto something david mentioned successful public cloud infrastructure benefit customer also massive paas saas business really empowers enterprise customer consumer frankly within oﬃce team change like david saying really reach many people transform business infrastructure change made get model wide group user see value take infrastructure customer use two half mean think satya talk intelligent cloud enterprise software cloud one thing benefit slosh back forth empower everyone brent bracelin doug burger david carmona doug burger brent bracelin doug burgerand think really top company half strong position fascinating seeing pace change space hard outside looking really fully appreciate get consumer technology see advancement right see small change software getting smarter right hard u quantify dramatic thing changing back end let drill harsh kind weigh architecture ai supercomputer trying understand azure kind build kind infrastructure run model azure ai supercomputer different maybe walk architecturally different ai supercomputer versus azure need kind think need kind optimized versus kind building apis azure walk u architecture david mind take initial crack one architect first think mistake view azure azure yeah okay lot common infrastructure across side think like want iaa customer let say big enterprise iaa customer need incredibly high reliability availability want great stability want predictable performance want access many region really planetary computer people build infrastructure computing utility stay go ai side trading one large model running single program job massive number massive collection machine okay note go right build resilience large deal distributing system lot harsh kumar doug burger david carmona doug burgerexperience example platform like bing stay respond matter one note drop building distributed system need complete job cheaply fast possible reliability characteristic component different need example lot networking train giant model data intensive communication global provision much aggressive cross data center networking need iaa customer obviously different mix hardware silicon component massive amount linear algebra think look high speed networking ability communicate quickly power requirement need drive raw performance thing accrue core azure business well extreme point business follow along benefit technological advancement making sorry two question earlier want go back five minute ago think mentioned maybe david mentioned transfer learning effectively would train large data set would give enterprise data center run talking something even smaller like running small chip edge still talking kind data center type process david take one yeah end massive model course thought run cloud time see many scenario optimization inﬂuencing model done edge go side side yeah absolutely doug anything add top technically yeah think way view transfer learning building base model super expensive ﬂavoring specific data like analogy might everyone call speaking english slightly different vocabulary nuance choice word hence provide training english could ﬂavor history individual customize model individual speech pattern harsh kumar david carmona doug burgerand lot david said earlier lot cheaper ﬂavoring build whole english model scratch training thing question deploy cloud edge think separate question absolutely incredible second question preferred sort computational mode microsoft fan fpgas versus gpus simply care common knowledge asic cheaper get set sort get parameter little bit want accomplish always want reduce cost computing asic curious ﬂavor guy prefer doug david one doug imagine get asked lot going say microsoft belief technology let give framing think help people understand space okay think ai training supercomputer massive amount effectively linear algebra need outstanding system architecture low agency communication need robust software stack need resilience system level like said get silicon got number got sort eﬃciency silicon like fast x raw ﬂops got model shift well silicon map shift got innovation might hardware helped model training might help converge like save cost got x set actually invested multiple technology disclosed actually bigger built part really really great training large model second thing would say really like term asic space kind gotten overused meaning mean customer chip right past meant something different right building chip circuit one purpose thing really programmable engine linear algebra ﬂexibly gpus fpgas talked engagement graft core ton across cloud edge intel programmable engine linear algebra different set eﬃciency math unit front end feed new like cpu many many year kind new class programmable harsh kumar doug burger brent bracelin david carmonaarchitecture emerging rapidly evolving space end day gpus fpgas called asics chip lot math unit architecture could even thank ultimately look like think know least talk side company go back kind try get different angle big question question think industry pace change 10x thinking technology change around moore law every 18 month doubling transistor think 10x every year limited number company keep pace change nervous investor around thing moving fast really going limited number company manage pace change thought david think card rail kind need industry eﬃcient card rail yeah feel counter intuitive actually technology like instead limiting access ai fewer company opposite opposite company let elaborate expect think mentioned company building massive model scratch time expect concept ai platform like past internet course mobile cloud equivalent ai look company developing ai today mean console platform sorry doug going hurt leave sense close something specific solution top platform something customized solution scenario want go place ai good accessible like platform use ai model customize model particular scenario big change seen see coming soon right applies also know talking lot nlp natural language processing apply every scenario coming back previous thing autonomous system similar pattern see autonomous system would say creating autonomous system limited company well look brent bracelin david carmona brent bracelin david carmonathe angle building component scratch like deeper reinforcement learning super complex technique available every enterprise address approach different provide platform abstracting top technique like reinforcement learning company address embrace autonomous system using expertise expertise business right comparison applies many different facet ai pursuing across company got sound like still moving silo centralized model available different internal department microsoft going start expose model externally kind azure service basis almost create new past layer ai essentially really ... exactly exactly timing around something going like 2021 2022 kind opportunity going multiple speaker go back ph tax \ph position like getting finish line going see value delivered journey right beginning last week already ton value company got used today dual approach company would say three thing look technology would position three different state first thing open innovation example open source fragment right example last week open source key framework key distributor framework engine called deep speed enable training right something cool right going phase infuse model growth already lot feature part product customer get access today used manner third stage would highlight also incorporate azure developer also build top right also thing like azure connected service ai model served service right easy use developer three thing cover entire spectrum hey today releasing everything right move make progress journey thing getting infused three main channel brent bracelin doug burger brent bracelin doug burger brent bracelin doug burger fascinating last question shift gear kind multiple speaker brent sorry could add point onto yeah think important investor imagine today started new company want become public cloud vendor want build another cloud business infrastructure compete big mega cloud capital need raise deploy build giant data center available around world many many region number software feature need provision number saas paas service need board achievable new entrant space especially look advantage big player referred enterprise software business well ai space go directly question need able build giant biggest supercomputer world built train model need really deep distributed system expertise need really really strong ai team understands capital well level expertise depth also think quite point would struggle try start public cloud large growing definition going limit number player able microsoft position want empower customer like david said give access technology number people number organization build infrastructure ground think going small inaudible kind lead next question around openai maybe could walk opening relationship put obviously bunch money lot really great talented engineer kind everything openai maybe walk microsoft openai relationship relate ai supercomputer announcement brent bracelin david carmona doug burger brent bracelini say one say two thing think david weigh want judicious commenting close partner number one openai among ambitious organization term trying ai mission like internal team push infrastructure hard okay think given scope ambition fact chose enter microsoft partnership think strong vote confidence infrastructure roadmap think look say wow one ambitious ai organization planet willing sign deal commit infrastructure tell something roadmap publicize helpful anything else david want weigh yeah think coming back doug point right sense order serve massive model need deal throw number ai supercomputer last week ago actually became immediately number five supercomputer world right sign scale need deal system like company time look formula one right innovation formula one make available typical card use every day thing investment creating ai supercomputer build massive model believe foundation ai platform mentioning available vendor really capital thing thinking innovation infusing azure everyday azure right big aspect consider right underscore point brent sorry sign minute think david said largest supercomputer world model growing 10x per year think implication minute likely version 1 fifth largest super computer world trying keep modeling kind appetite growing 10x year fascinating harsh question harsh kumar brent bracelin david carmona doug burger david carmona outweighed actually question quantum computing wait finish let shift gear kind enterprise reality enterprise reality going pandemic work home feel like environment could see thing ai product start pause slow seeing kind post pandemic environment relative kind ai appetite ai slowing accelerating walk u seeing want take one doug go ahead multiple speaker yeah please top yeah something say even pandemic seeing change conversation enterprise remember maybe four five year ago every conversation customer hey ai fee top right next thing finally company realize okay big need embrace ai want transfer business next thing get started saw lot adoption enterprise first phase adoption right many pilot many proof concept et cetera time seeing shifting market really funding back business move beyond proof concept connect ai business outcome conversation really happening pandemic global crisis done conversation accelerating even seen customer cutting chase telling u hey need putting ai action need usually conversation two front right one current crisis technical diﬃculty ai tool let deal disruption buying experiencing today even longer term know never going back previous normal going new situation lot economic uncertainty lot care optimize revenue optimize operation et cetera company ai help first one let maybe think question first one right today company ai ai helping doug burgerdisruption experiencing see three primary scenario three used case actually saw race demand customer see across industry particular vertical first one obvious course customer service visible one right company many case piloting using ai streamline customer service accelerating project like see example company working 18 month project current crisis put production two day right acceleration see case go many case definitely customer support like perfect storm request customer time operation impacted crisis case seeing broader scenario like really able identify best customer proactive personalizing service customer see across number customer happy later time go example company one scenario one see hugely happening crisis course business process optimization like separate see first thing customer noticing process established past disrupted dramatically think supply chain right think forecasting demand fraud detection customer churn process dramatically different right need put place process agile ﬂexible change ai solution helping area one thing thing course specifically economic situation see customer looking cost saving right business process mean lot see many customer using ai shorten business process streamline business process make productive second scenario third one see lot another perfect storm right employee productivity think course technical diﬃculty go beyond see another perfect storm complex situation employee deal business point view impacted productivity current situation see company looking ai short term increase employee productivity see many many example three doug know want add something top go deeper example want later yeah thought super interesting even interesting mean company thank david would underscore david said seeing crisis accelerating company desire digital transformation partially need partially going brent bracelin doug burger david carmona harsh kumar brent bracelin harsh kumarto optimize process deferred long time might well right satya invested enormously microsoft bd trying company help people solve problem digital transformation think opportunity infrastructure service really help customer think type kind ai used case seem kind resonating right give three example kind nlp speech computer vision one type ai really like oh god taken much faster would thought david go ahead think pick favorite right nlp nlp right hot moment acceleration especially relevant area tricky nlp nlp complex requires generalization complex solve new state model see huge potential example said nlp see technique ai across board david vouch nine month since spoken live person without speaking machine first think experience absolutely ca 15 minute left think helpful maybe get update project brainwave obviously doug think last time met kind three year ago get kind deep dive love understand maybe harsh probably better go turn harsh get maybe update project brainwave sure sure david doug give u minute overview trying accomplish project brainwave jump question doug burger david carmona doug burger harsh kumar doug burger david carmona doug burgerdavid want take doug okay project continuing continuing go super well using continue use scale worldwide serve model trend like said definitely mix technology infrastructure program particular able incorporate innovation fairly rapidly really push model serving inference side capable think really focused internal business need pressing think need serve giant model latency cost expense lot innovation required want talk much going seeing publicly year would chance get updated one term hear lot obviously see hollywood movie stuff like well quantum computing curious since guy top leading expert country ai wondering quantum computing even applied ai manner useful completely different thing guy feel potential maybe commercializing next five 10 many every year long would david mind start yeah take certainly overlap two research community looking machine learning quantum algorithm algorithm would say right personal view speaking company initially two technology ai supercomputer quantum harsh kumar doug burger harsh kumar doug burger harsh kumar doug burger harsh kumar brent bracelinsystems targeting different application thing solve lot quantum algorithm different problem ai model eventually may convergence quantum think best initially problem huge compute requirement lot state simply diﬃculty keeping larger massive state superimposed domain look amount state driving train model massive think disruptive technology initially attacking different class problem theoretically possible overlap longer term doug say state exactly mean familiar information bit okay got many bit state hold one computer 1,000 10,000 petabyte data operating azure computer space sound like far away best way think quantum computing least couple year away want take position quantum roadmap would say scale ai think pretty far away quantum space brent anything yeah let shift gear little bit maybe talk kind real world used case covered lot ground gave u scenario people using recently announced nda announced sort kind new used case think build last week two week coming build around new large enterprise ai microsoft ai azure ai think doug burger david carmonathere like 20,000 enterprise deployed azure ai point last year walk people actually using interesting scenario come across like highlight u take technology real world scenario question david yeah take one doug would use frame using would add one component frame using scenario like go like canonical example even bring real customer three scenario would add additional one post moment right moment see company reimagining completely new normal experience bring example thing area well let start today let start customer using ai today three scenario started customer service customer service easy one weird find customer using ai customer service general customer engagement right many example think exciting one announced last week actually healthcare area microsoft know provide platform customer create example bot user customer service also provide saas solution use directly solution scenario one particular called azure healthcare bot service vertical bot health organization use today customer service case patient service seen last month exponential usage service give sense seen 1500 health organization public health organization health provider et cetera implementing new project think 1500 new project put production specifically management bot deployed week reach 30 million people think scale right provided huge tool really unload reduce load seeing health professional like doctor nurse first level interaction patient assessment tool patient take order redirected right resource right would one example bring business process optimization seen know start every company lot area one think mentioned one one one announced last week fedex like fedex perfect example business process optimization massive amount data granular data shipment fedex agreement going ai top better intelligence going identify trend happening product happening also optimize supply chain right organization really really perfect example business process optimization could see everywhere think indialends another customer indialends underwriting credit platform india like 50 bank india case using ai credit approval system able decrease time processing time internal processing time credit approval 50 time imagine impact ability process twice number credit right moment like absolutely critical manufacturing seen also many example think mentioned one see company starting use autonomous system moonshot autonomous driving thing like motion control process optimization manufacturing getting big result day zero right see many customer front going bring well tell business process optimization actually saw also healthcare limited resourcing right critical thing like medical supply even hospital bed optimized thing like ai typical one mentioned employee productivity let bring couple example one generic see lot ai working human outman productivity give example reuters case reuters journalist writing article case using ai supporting attach relevant video article go manual process finding relevant video also using ai also increase average completion rate 80 technique right better employee productivity better result one would mention connected think employee productivity removing like tedious task repetitive task also making better decision example bring team rubicon managing 100,000 volunteer u think massive scale solution required mean case using ai really identify optimize deployment volunteer across u important work really making better decision example first part company using ai response rate let use couple example imagine phase right think big conversation going health crisis turn economic crisis right see three key thing happening let use example brent bracelin david carmonathe first one talk lot today ai scale know talk lot ai scale concept model bigger motion happen enterprise really applying ai scale business moving pilot phase everything key thing bring example right need scale usage ai across business unit moving beyond technical unit see business connected ai transformation something happen certainly move phase example would bring course key thing think key lesson gone software development remember conversation 10 year ago software knew called devops bringing developer technical unit business together combined life cycle ai technical unit working silo pilot infused business equivalent devops ai called mlops see huge trend moving forward example bring published department transit vancouver case think case talk lot size model number model need transform industry transfer company case company 18,000 model think number model think managing model way silo technical unit right brought together business technical unit common mlops process across one know talking lot let go two think important second one regarding ... got one minute drill conclude one minute second one want mention next step transformation empower business talked lot technical unit developing ai next step made big step microsoft empower business also apply ai right thing like power platform dynamic 365 see reality moving forward one example bring novartis novartis pharmaceutical know like year ago signed agreement basically empowering 50,000 employee almost half employee ai think using ai applying ai ﬂexibility freedom process researcher researching new drug new treatment new vaccine augmented ai using process drug brent bracelin david carmona doug burger david carmona brent bracelin doug burgermanufacturers cellular matter expert huge motion see moving forward third one would last one let forget responsible ai see responsible ai conversation many year really seeing also huge shift conversation front hey challenge ai principle microsoft ai huge risk accelerate adoption ai help implement ai responsible mitigate risk many example read one td bank bank u canada see using responsible ai mitigate thing like bias thing like adding transparency model deploying thank david guy much talk ai jonathan extended conversation another hour kidding last question doug think pace change tax last year modeling side excited thinking ai industry microsoft opportunity next three year one thing one thing excited thinking doug david need give thought keep going back concept really putting ai action concept democratizing ai know technical lot going empower motion go beyond infrastructure software really comprehensive solution research three cloud tool right really really powerful get next year driving business outcome sure yes yeah going give little bit squishy answer true answer rarely get opportunity personal view work thing david carmona brent bracelin david carmona doug burger brent bracelin david carmona brent bracelinreally change world positive way think capability going able generate perspective hardware system work know help really solve global problem mean like lifetime opportunity build something allows u really make meaningful shift personalized medicine climate change eﬃciency security turning back concept responsibility really feel driven mission purpose really move needle make world better place really blessing great doug nice said beginning adjust answer well listen time really appreciate david doug sharing view current state ai always pleasure thank much sharing thought thank thanks good opportunity chat great job tag team often pleasure always bye take care
