recommendation software dashboard could type bi space isft go go see different theme write soft infrastructure software side well data license data idc part dashboard number tool help monitor company overall industry move al give quick introduction start discussion great thanks anurag al gillen responsible number area research idc operating system research client server side since 1999 idc also oversee virtualization software research enterprise server research collectively see infrastructure research foundation cloud well o layer client device wanted start start brief overview offer opening thought around see window 10 positioning improvement general give sense think product fit market think back microsoft brought window 8 part understanding window 8 understand microsoft focusing targeting particular product much play much touch first solution certainly think could argue microsoft rotated ph two dimension brought device consumer oriented many feature business user would wanted would expected would business user adopted window 8 anyway even perfect product simple reason window 7 already solution displacing window xp business user skipped window vista momentum going window 7 experience watching business customer move jump o o every two three year tend wait much longer cycle frankly think could even argue getting window 7 business move window 10 sometimes going challenge least segment microsoft customer microsoft sale force bring people probably important differential window 10 window 8 graphical user interface instead touch oriented user interface really put classic keyboard mouse application significant disadvantage window 10 integrate two environment together ui really truly move two paradigm comfortably use touch oriented application alongside conjunction keyboard mouse application ability resize window side side top one another unlike scenario window 8 window 8.1 really fixed number configuration could size window 8 application alongside window older window 7 window early early window application start menu microsoft got lot grief removing start menu addition start button least window 8.1 update really brought back native ui native window 8 environment done actually brought back ui look lot performs behaves lot like window 7 start button frankly business user important paradigm shift happen user go replace application window 8 could case business application even updated window 8 native could get window 8 native ui application still running window 7 application window 8 environment going forward application wo citizen way window 8 8 8.1 term application really believe perhaps single important thing technology added window 10 universal application platform universal application platform allows developer build application leveraged across different device window 10 run write one application relatively little work extend application phone tablet pc user experience frankly two thing one creates much larger ecosystem developer microsoft hard time courting developer getting get excited relatively small installed base tablet relatively small installed base phone integrating pc environment together phone tablet microsoft larger overall ecosystem pitch developer get developer bring application upgrade application window 10 native honestly think probably one important thing done simply allow application developer successful building application run across multiple platform give essentially look feel granted form factor little different phone pc user interface similar enough really feel like using application think important technology course microsoft challenge today getting application developer use universal application platform modernize apps talk little bit couple minute get topic larger microsoft ecosystem feature cortana integration certainly need smart intelligent assistant intelligent agent device nice thing cortana exists pc phone tablet move one device another common experience value benefit application experience microsoft store going offer convergence point application customer want everything phone pc application able acquired microsoft store creates unified experience microsoft customer creates larger ecosystem developer pretty important think talk little bit unification experience think together universal application platform two feature really go hand hand got new technology edge browser got lot publicity earlier year microsoft rolled recognize internet explorer disappear go away mean still embedded system certain application type say certain website still going using internet explorer simple reason edge browser support protocol experience internet explorer browser business user particular lot older website require internet explorer mean still used case used edge browser going preferred browser think part happened microsoft embraced really standard developed industry really nobody else embrace microsoft went developed thing customer use technology never used browser maker browser one lighter faster internet explorer one carry baggage around old apis old programming technique necessarily used browser microsoft frankly something disadvantage term browser could compete edge browser became fairly necessary finally think important think ecosystem point view microsoft enlarged ecosystem trajectory going really single larger ecosystem device spanning phone way pc however go beyond look microsoft example hololens granted hololens necessarily end user productivity solution conventional sense platform window platform frankly creates really fascinating new opportunity developer excitement around particular technology really surprise chance see early year microsoft demonstrated analyst community back january inaudible press community brought forward microsoft ignite event forth people attending event really quite excited chance try hololens developer workshop forth help people understand program product sense creates greater ecosystem greater reason develop window overall frankly think help create interest window family overall important long time since microsoft anything truly got developer excited surface hub another one probably seen announcement think last week two week ago possibly surface hub really collaboration system designed large format provide great interoperability microsoft product going create think think going anurag rana al gillento create wave large collaboration space equally important window device well bringing window 10 opportunity development perspective target location developer put application finally xbox one microsoft continuing bring xbox window closer together run xbox application window 10 environment frankly experience becoming like xbox environment see goal microsoft moving unify ecosystem something cohesive complete ecosystem al thanks good description let start talking ecosystem think end day fight let talk strategy behind enlighten u look apple io apple different operating system macbook different operating system phone believe case android critical reason microsoft decide go one operating system device mean technical point view advantage disadvantage discussion software developer picked side mean people believe one better take think think advantage disadvantage single ecosystem let explain let disadvantage first inaudible forward made clear going one ecosystem device type downside really offer way developer optimize problem basically asking pc developer develop phone trying recruit phone developer develop myriad device reality many phone developer phone tablet developer really focused singular form factor deployment two similar form factor deployment think part microsoft seen perceived developer community clinging onto pc root would microsoft would microsoft go away pc business important think lot people would see microsoft trying prop pc business expanding necessarily agree perspective see many people industry would see negative see attractive developer positive side microsoft able leverage frankly large developer community around microsoft window product base think excess 1 billion pc market billion half pc something like installed majority running form anurag rana al gillenwindows really large community able sell lot product developer really successful inaudible point view microsoft leveraging strength leveraging relationship developer give new platform develop footing back negative side developer microsoft ecosystem probably looked said well really many microsoft tablet microsoft phone market right develop small market got really large market android io point view mean pro con microsoft struggling yeah completely agree end day apps getting developer start making apps ecosystem let touch universal window apps second gave u good description look apps right window somewhere know around 350,000 somewhere range io android skirting around 1.5 million mark one way software development worked well last 15 20 year give lot incentive developer community make apps time user community think good apps get product like chicken egg problem android making software free getting licensed sort oem vendor know worked well microsoft also going route making know window license fee extremely variable nature certain size pay anything pay anything upgrade going make sure ecosystem around window 10 becomes large would incentivize developer community develop apps think right way go talk people financial service community financial investment community lot happy free upgrade happy microsoft giving away license fee smaller screen device yeah touched two different thing talked ecosystem talked motivation microsoft give away product certain market segment relates directly ecosystem sense perspective microsoft absolutely right thing making window free small form anurag rana al gillenfactor device mobile device particular important simply revenue gained mean course apple sell sell io exclusive hardware like developer go build phone get buy io put android effectively free microsoft going compete something effectively free arguably another value proposition would justify paying window license way going sell choice choice come market product price tag sell nothing give product away hope get traction developer device maker help build ecosystem device ecosystem since place software developer go think latter really reason microsoft need ecosystem need large installed base device place application developer sell product hit right head chicken egg problem mean ca ca robust ecosystem robust set customer get product market product wo go market reason people develop device using product feel ecosystem sell device sell device really two go microsoft need create strong interest among device maker use product create environment software developer see lot microsoft lot device running microsoft software attractive place build application getting two thing move sync actually hard thing giving away window smart phone tablet think smart thing mean ph theory said right thing time remember correctly mobile world congress last year year decided sometime saw restructuring yesterday company sure kind traction window phone getting seems like competition android io pretty well point yeah pretty well year ago last spring microsoft made announcement around timeframe announced version oﬃce io also much mobile first driven decision point view big part satya nadella trying make clear going create microsoft ecosystem space anurag rana al gillenand regard restructuring yesterday mean obviously know going sort end seems fairly clear deemphasizing focus hardware time also bringing hardware software team much closer together would argue make agile able put integrated device together yeah absolutely let let mean think brought good point satya mobile first cloud first initiative let talk little bit one thing written extensively last six month seen huge cultural change way thing operated microsoft whether said making oﬃce available ipad starting partnering people like box dropbox going making azure open rival basically biggest stuff rival something necessity pressured genuinely company becoming lot open way go term next leg infrastructure well really little bit mean microsoft could ignore linux sure microsoft would ignore linux frankly end day competitive threat lot different dimension problem microsoft longer ignore linux recognized linux viable operating system place environment customer using service provider using microsoft real choice except new new structure new world order whether play term supporting azure say linux azure specifically mean particular case mean really see necessarily bad well certainly bad decision think necessarily drive accelerate linux anyway mean customer want run linux iaa environment going somewhere whether going amazon azure want rackspace service provider mean anywhere want end microsoft focusing goal goal making sure successful cloud ecosystem future part involves supporting workload let underscore word workload operating system customer want run customer want run something linux azure microsoft selling cycle really difference monetization microsoft experience running linux instance azure versus window instance iaa anurag rana al gillenenvironment azure answer really mean microsoft selling selling cycle selling disk space selling network connectivity part point view sort go term supporting competitive product dimension especially mobile space mean microsoft recognizing world changed world anymore microsoft still basically owns pc market market growing necessarily future lot customer part new ecosystem since o level microsoft focusing hard part essential part ecosystem way thing like oﬃce 365 azure ad mobile device management mean way part ecosystem absolutely fact hit nail head said particular market think best cultural shift actually something people followed microsoft realized completely come shock definitely let jump brought azure active directory let discus azure active directory window 10 kind feature would make easy enterprise start using mobile device let talk yeah well think think enterprise ecosystem moving moving environment got prime application going increasingly using application prime going saas application going application running iaa environment longer term going see net new application built beginning run environment seeing much today lot excitement developer community piece really begun manifest enterprise space consumer space got lot pas based application already deployed term using azure azure really vehicle microsoft banking one key revenue producer future reasonable believe existing installed instance window server pick number whether 2008 2012 even old server 2003 still anurag ranaall application running window instance continue live window environment going ported uniquely different environment certainly linux probably natively azure going running iaa environment probably rest life argue many case going measured year rather decade anybody doubt remember let forget happened industry panic update replace mainframe application two digit decode problem case fix application case still using application business value business value today anyway dialing back azure kind azure play platform support apps mobile end user device perspective access different application increasingly inﬂux mobile device corporate owned necessarily going fully authenticated window infrastructure microsoft encouraging customer look using azure ad key entry point device prime prime application see thing starting get stitched together also thing example window 10 authentication capability going improve security sort thing built window 10 well think integration see azure ad window 10 mean one thing microsoft really positioning future drive customer use solution mean well one exciting thing looking forward come corporate world think consumer world may behind doubt late game integration think opportunity break enterprise space space start move tablet mobile phone area get lot work done right seeing pure play let say mobile device management company specialized solution think road stuff like would integrated either core operating system part something like azure active directory pay whole lot mean pay something case tying ph product becomes little easier case buying separate bundle view al gillen anurag rana al gillen yeah mean think happened last 20 20 ph plus year history operating system market happens operating system provides level functionality product built close operating system like management solution well mean inaudible back say thing like browser tcp/ip stack forth exclusive o time technology get absorbed operating system hypervisors another really good example mean certainly hypervisors vmware brought audio esxi ph much standalone technology today every major operating system embedded integrated hypervisor really hard go monetize hypervisor vmware monetization primarily associated management tool frankly lot stuff software defined technology vmware adding appendix basic hypervisor functionality monetization made possible point operating system absorbs functionality either cost feature use pay either inaudible part operating system going forward pay small uplift access think thing true azure think going find microsoft going continue absorb deliver integrated solution provide device management authentication identity management really really important dimension mean many player offer kind directory infrastructure like microsoft one key kingdom people would like yeah exactly thought saying look right look enterprise traditional enterprise newer company based cloud completely different go traditional bank today traditional manufacturing firm still whole lot pc desktop lying around mean wave move kind mobile device whether tablet whether device think always felt thing microsoft actually might edge compared company given already huge installed base already application written window kind integrated tool actually make switch little bit easier thought anurag rana al gillenyeah well mean really big distinction consumer market professional business market right microsoft deep penetration commercial sector change fact even mobile device commercial business continue use pc know many pc oﬃce five year ago happen couple tablet couple cell phone well many case especially certainly knowledge worker frankly even manufacturing retail forth use pc necessarily go away get augmented additional device respect idc belief pc market commercial side necessarily growing going contracting either relatively ﬂat market business opportunity continue consume window product right much maybe application written segment industry written window pc ca necessarily replace thing easily mobile device frankly sure right thing manufacturing environment really want move app pc tablet know right thing many case fair enough let jump talk little bit device point always case obviously went massive upgrade last year xp 7 also mentioned opening remark think anyone right mind right mind expecting similar kind wave corporate world think could happen consumer space second half year next 12 month trigger new form factor touch device kind view point yeah fact let switch next slide talking point sense first let talk one year upgrade offer microsoft offered let talk think mean mean gotten lot question folk financial service industry well customer manufacturing oem space well end user really mean belief first think microsoft business selling upgrade two basic business selling upgrade sell upgrade enterprise agreement software assurance software assurance give access next current version product time come large company tend one would buy software assurance contract consumer side small business side consumer side see customer buying kind agreement certainly consumer anurag rana al gillenca buy ca buy maintenance contract window product consumer would would go staple would buy box software say window 10 upgrade buy replacement window 7 window 8 product genuine window 7 license upgrade window 8 window 10 whatever version might reality business well relatively visible would see box software retailer never really much material business microsoft really mean offering free upgrade window 10 believe leaving lot money table moving direction creating motivation customer move put window around upgrade offer want get got get next 12 month think going motivate lot consumer move forward window 10 long window 10 get bad review right box really think going happen would expect majority consumer installed base going take advantage move forward next 12 month creates fairly instantaneous installed base window 10 device granted phone tablet pc microsoft inaudible made billion device commitment window actually went back looked sorry yeah agree yeah remember yeah yeah yeah went back looked number said microsoft get billion device actually look number look number pc market even think phone tablet minute mean could almost get upgrading consumer upgrade say 90 consumer pc maybe half business pc get pretty close billion unit right happened even period mean like period upgrade offer start add factor net new pc phone tablet ship next three year getting billion device outrageous fact argue almost fairly conservative statement made point view doable anyway back point happens think consumer side market make fairly aggressive move window 10 assuming number one customer click upgrade window 10 work effectively break lot user number two done upgrade window 10 function well microsoft promise two early people upgraded bad experience could actually slow upgrade momentum early experience generally pretty good think help open door consumer market move forward thing hold true particularly small business typically behave like consumer like large business thing get little le certain get large business kind structured department place probably going resistant moving window 10 simply guarantee support 10 going want qualify going make sure application compatible thing typically break upgrade software back agent management tool using thing make sure work window 10 thing actually able move window 10 without problem lower barrier movement finally term enterprise customer typically software assurance place sa contract business already access window 10 need free upgrade offer microsoft get respect option go window 10 whenever right ironically enough probably slow mean one year time pressure larger organization sa simply got long continue stay current sa upgrade point point time want kind scenario upgrade term one last comment point term one year offer microsoft know vague maybe best term use happens end one year fact one point wrote document shared microsoft review made comment year pay upgrade microsoft gave u feedback well really strike sentence said thought really telling comment telling u telling customer year going pay window 10 think think leaving door open extend one year offer two year something like prepared come building immediate ecosystem developer community feel pressure get application upgrade window 10 new developer maybe window product today say io android developer going look say okay yeah anurag rana al gillen anurag rana al gillenreally lot device running window ecosystem maybe see lot developer said writing io android mean also mean probably judgment might never thought microsoft one cool company think hololens surface hub trying platform internet thing think change stuff internet thing need decent enough platform window 10 work way supposed work mean could one choice customer make case would see developer rushing build application yeah hate say microsoft lost designation cool company probably decade ago agree thing like hololens window 10 ecosystem universal application platform make lot attractive developer hololens particular think think anybody argue cool technology mean think thing like get attention developer enables new developer enables developer build new application thing people thought actually pleased see thing stepping comfort zone felt like early 2000s microsoft saw conservative company willing take risk thing fairly certain safe bet saw drag foot thing like virtualization example mean slow getting virtualization vmware took vmware taking microsoft realized maybe really space fact gone done something precedent really speaks lot toward innovative frankly something developer look say really cool bought minecraft know cool stuff let ask mean found interesting thing think logical window insider program close 4 million user right software development better feedback better product going taken long even think something like like five year ago seven year ago anything like anurag rana al gillen anurag ranawell microsoft used make early copy product available finite number close customer would work never really kind broad open developer experience like insider program certainly window move toward window 8 fact really slammed door closed collaborating community large frankly think work well think microsoft woken realized concept community real concept using community advantage actually beneficial mean certainly linux open source developer community illustrated engaging large number people collaboratively work project way really getting benefit people normally would necessarily consider collaborator microsoft really getting back sync way industry moving today much oriented done think would left significant risk sync customer completely agree question audience want understand whether window 10 spur replacement demand pc especially consumer pc yeah lot talk internally sense idc window 10 giving away window 10 free two thing one make available broad basis user normally would maybe inaudible buy new pc right get experience new product frankly experience personally touch screen even using window 8 8.1 mean much better experience touch screen without chance experience window 10 experienced without touch screen go store get plywood machine shelf touch screen realized convenient helpful think going certain amount ph going come experience may help consumer actually realize buying new pc window 10 beneficial see let clear suggesting going create surge market window pc think help maintain market evolution frankly help move customer quickly toward considering new pc giving experience touched window 10 al gillen anurag rana al gillen anurag rana al gillen anurag ranai another question al say customer forced upgrade hardware hardware requirement different one previous version got window certainly got window 8 even window 7 case put window 10 pc without problem okay cool good know another question say supply chain holding production till window 10 launched seen bottleneck end actually coverage area ca really speak directly supply chain say look back previous window launch generally see contraction shipment leading launch new window product followed kind resumption little bit surge following launch kind average several quarter necessarily create see sustained acceleration product sale specifically surrounding window operating system release anymore happened year ago really happen day cool reminder need ask question please use q panel right powerpoint slide wait couple minute see question right think anymore question mean al ending remark anything else want talk well specifically side window client product probably pretty good job mention recognize one fairly large portfolio product microsoft recognized window server 2012 coming pike well launched sometime first half 2016 going lead ultimately another wave window replacement see window server 2008 product starting taper displaced server 2012 server 2016 point view going product going bridge lot customer deployment al gillensir good point maybe another webinar talk thanks much time al thanks everyone listening thank
