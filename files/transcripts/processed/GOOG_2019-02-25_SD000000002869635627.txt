transition digital world unless grow creator ecosystem unless grow app developer really grow big part area focus number one second one service business run technical operation consumer operation across world large business 90 product 25 different language think service call chat per second least across world even counting online web interaction get ready world scale deploy machine learning get service operation ready type user interaction obviously growth environment second big one third one third area focus country operation run country operation across world eï¬ƒciently effectively run country put lot focus high growth market like india brazil example big pillar work fourth one really around say leadership operational rigor undergoing business moment pretty robust growth rate take look level leadership need able operate environment take lot energy take lot effort one also operational rigor sure something known outside world really try run world little bit like mission control like space shuttle control center know maybe spacex blue origin whatever called take approach actually run business incredibly detailed dashboard deeply understand revenue distribution

example know example customer benefit move bidding system next generation machine learning call smart bidding deep q brian thomas nowak philipp schindler q brian thomas nowak philipp schindlerunderstanding percentage customer base portfolio come smart bidding penetration know exactly best world know exactly worst world know exactly much value generated advertiser much value time generated u moving worst best actually obviously also increasing best little bit lot spread management rigorous way operational rigor one biggest area focus understood lot irreplaceable yes 100 billion revenue plus minus annualized basis guess mention different product thought automated bidding good example kind want go curious hear sort process take internally think trying push new advertising unit new monetization opportunity platform sort debate lot time wall street addressable market ad dollar think sort amount dollar available captured alphabet couple different thing first addressable market side lot misunderstanding people usually refer total line advertising market le traditional television bunch adjacent area usually described 500 billion 0.5 trillion market size let forget huge different chunk line market different estimate high lot people saying least equal size higher actually actually agree look agree bigger well equal size would line bigger potentially adjacent market slightly overlapping look fact still 90 commerce oï¬ „ ine big opportunity obviously environment general think sense traditional advertising think actually business connecting business consumer long business generates positive roi search advertising obviously one main market providing incredibly positive roi advertiser actually working hope business invest represent actually adequately investing understanding roi generate reality working really well long roi positive think really limited way look market market size look maybe second first part defining question look core business usually try decompose business especially search business different q brian thomas nowak philipp schindlercomponents look example core search 1 part decomposition would obviously query maybe park piece second next big piece within obviously ad coverage go little deeper run actually internally ad coverage obviously 100 trying provide best answer trying provide meaningful answer consumer reality probably interesting development path think metric next one call customer rate next big part decomposition rate side similar question ask upside improvement area telling fixed rate somewhere towards 100 obviously creative make better deploy machine learning make ctrs better interesting area development see world last big driver core search business obviously whole world cpc customer click people willing bid environment one biggest driver cpc world conversion rate similar development take look world conversion rate upside mean investing lot comparable business probably deep understanding conversion rate think anybody would say coming close world 100 conversion rate probably even fraction think upside done accelerating mobile website loading speed making payment easier making transaction easier making discoverability easier using better ui probably significant upside right away basically positively inï¬‚uence cpc development look total addressable market perspective connecting business consumer look detailed decomposition search business think lot interesting potential point search wanted ask let start mobile search last year mentioned ad coverage seen number ad unit increase case mobile search last couple year series innovation well least think helped drive better mobile search monetization sit seat 2 3 product excited continue drive strong mobile search monetization go yes first keep mind launching roughly around 100 enhancement core search product probably per quarter significant number second part question talk really thing excited really upside talk first potentially little bit later term overall development drive ad coverage upside cpcs upside rate help partner ecosystem advertiser agency partner work better thing pretty significant investment area described feel lot room improvement q brian thomas nowak philipp schindler desktop side desktop sometimes focus tech company like think oldest business think desktop search business business 40 billion annual revenue still growing think high single maybe even low double digit quarter pretty impressive able monetization perspective transition towards mobile voice think desktop monetization potential great question always keep mind new platform come along mean platform fundamentally disappears doubt obviously mobile mobile revolution significantly increased amount interaction mobile device reality also desktop still robust business give feel lot use case mostly high involvement use case want complex travel booking look new life insurance insurance type desktop business actually robust expectation level actually stay quite take look future exactly right next revolution evolution whatever want call mobile one parallel mobile one kicking obviously everything voice search assistant broader context look effort area assistant product roughly 1 billion device moment 20 query u.s. android android mobile app coming already voice definitely trend emerging also already happening significant scale happening across multiple different surface expectation level amount interaction digital device much easier use controlled interface level interaction increase probably assume case thing done historically oï¬ „ ine world transition easier user interface across different surface mean whether mobile phone whether mobile device whether speaker whether car whether smart device different type yes course mean interesting development challenging part general smaller surface area surface area higher expectation level consumer result whether organic advertising result something actually historically good simple example look desktop 10 billion link look mobile lot le look system give one single answer consumer expectation level quality answer significantly higher obvious question would probably well voice voice world one single answer build monetization model think really important understand context assistant mean voice voice model many use case going forward especially commercial use case think actually see voice display much interesting use case see already smart speaker emerging think lot area actually q brian thomas nowak philipp schindler q brian thomas nowaktalk sort digital assistant get visual back simple example right interested buying new nice jacket ask assistant `` hi show nicest whatever blue jacket available site category like would want speaker say `` well blue jacket b c would rather really nice picture displayed world think comfortable visual result really amazing discovery experience room advertising course call really interesting commercial experience well business roughly think evolution desktop mobile assistant different surface different output factor way different input factor well voice need input factor assistant think world use something like google lens video picture input factor assistant different input actually different output depending user actually feel comfortable jacket example actually may might answered next question perhaps investing shopping search quite time shopping action google express product listing ad mentioned voice search next step really capitalize shopping need visual interface really deliver value advertiser search shopping perspective well mean mobile device desktop mobile device pretty visual interface right already working well lot really nice shopping product look product listing ad one shopping action example launched seen 7x increase something number merchant participating including number big merchant nike best buy sephora really nice development obviously ability measure sale lift much different scale think talking somewhere area 10 transaction measured already environment talked google lens use input factor lot really really interesting product area reality also look existing pla product probably biggest product moment product listing ad environment look shopping query look left right swipe little carousel would describe best discovery experience ever developed world mobile shopping probably spending lot time energy thinking make bigger better richer visual experience better consumer experience overall actually pretty excited put positively upside ui development user experience let go back voice search point voice lot talk voice search service threat alphabet opportunity alphabet philipp schindler q brian thomas nowak philipp schindler q brian thomas nowakdo think kind voice search sort step need kind make chasm cross actually real monetization opportunity well think voice search context assistant development talked well knowing tiny little difference depending define look evolution platform desktop mobile assisted interaction computing interface something voice search fit assumption assistant environment computing interface becomes easier use ubiquitous see lot see lot richer see lot visual output factor use case go even simplest use case weather forecast next 10 day really want assistant read going rainy monday tuesday wednesday go want like sort projection picture something mobile device triggered something television nearby room aware nearby room way obviously many different way think assistant service rich answer exactly world deeply understand similar monetization model actually run today got thing search want talk idea discover feed activity card point making search visual sort early learning product think sort building advertising really helping advertiser buying demand product yes mean great product think discover feed like 800 million monthly active moment nice number feed try understand consumer well obviously give really relevant result whenever understand consumer well create also interesting commercial experience around definitely something thinking something excited would think comparable run traditional search system moment youtube video product youtube certain number tv well positioned perspective still think based authorized data youtube still destination 1 come online video strong reach strong engagement maybe talk recent ad rolled trueview around youtube heard trueview reach trueview action changed advertiser discussion philipp schindler q brian thomas nowak philipp schindleraround youtube talk u real driver youtube revenue growth yes youtube always really interesting platform brand advertiser really tried develop last year also ability youtube cater performance advertiser invested pretty meaningfully last year actually worked really well reason look consumer actually using youtube mean significant amount something learn something incredible mean let ask mean room see paying attention room actually one point used youtube either search something want get better research certain product yes everybody audio think probably 90 become better financial analyst whatever mean lot become better running google business guide also probably reality lot really really relevant information obviously get system infrastructure right challenge around conversion tracking easy path reality mean working working extremely well performance advertiser think 30 advertiser new one using performance product youtube actually excited part development obviously let forget youtube still great brand advertiser think 18 youtube top 10 primetime show u.s. combined mean pretty meaningful number brand well established performance business mean something happened like mean universal app campaign think started 2015 roughly tapping performance trueview action launched think march 2018 remember correctly year ago exactly discussion talked yes exciting environment new group advertiser map probably got sometimes say asset cover google map almost like utility kind waiting put switch guess early map monetization experimentation last couple year via sponsored link via promoted pin et cetera talk u sort early learning map monetization product put take make internally decide quickly push cadence monetization yes map lot different angle look map think easiest way differentiating different consumer use case obviously angle use map basically get certain destination quickly much utility use case need really cautious interfere consumer experience q brian thomas nowak philipp schindleron one consumer want get really quickly destination want information quickly understanding destination obviously interesting monetization model develop around second big one people asking something around near something near something around look latest product developed like local campaign way based lot machine learning using advertising product described think quite interesting area think like third one really broader discovery element want discover something around directly near broader sense could think personalized recommendation think way basing place already visited historically make recommendation take completely different world think fourth area think world call google business smb world discovery small business around tie make really seamless easy experience think think map monetization 4 different angle little bit caution obviously first one disrupting utility aspect 3 think really really interesting playground going forward sort talk machine learning almost overused buzz phrase saying guess sort simplify someone like give u example use machine learning internally improve overall user experience advertiser offering even value bring partner publisher give u example go internally use machine learning user experience many example mean everything google photo operates hood spam detection many thing mean gazillion example use user experience let focus monetization side advertiser partner experience interesting area probably completely revolutionized apps product like universal app campaign fundamentally built around machine learning smart shopping campaign today something launched ago call responsive search ad trying tackle creative problem try basically much better predicting good creatives rewriting creatives completely rethinking world creative digital environment way go back remember decomposed beginning core business talked ctrs think thing come together development could different product also uplevel little bit ask okay use machine learning either better finding audience general right message right audience right creative disposition react certain advertising message obviously audience side think creative perspective big color q brian thomas nowak philipp schindler q brian thomas nowak philipp schindleradvertising talked big third one obviously bidding fact machine learning algorithm significantly better significantly better bidding human traditional system pretty obvious think audience creative bidding perspective also really really interesting area applied frankly applied quite advertising team sophisticated using latest machine learning development basically apply different area see lot interesting thing come ctr roi advertiser lot going one asset think almost enough attention sometimes view google play store asset power billion android user taking depending structure 15 30 cut transaction think pretty good business couple big debate go perspective first 1 2 biggest area innovation needed app store number two think potential restructure commission rate maybe even lower help publisher get exposure kind get lower take rate look way think developer publisher however want refer partner getting actually pretty significant amount value investment investing heavily world whether whole world security safety massive development create really clean safe ecosystem big area look different developer program running play best console massive massive investment side really value creating developer big area look whole world payment payment infrastructure facilitating payment making easy seamless another big world look 4 whole world discovery recommendation engine promotion app really appreciated developer ecosystem well look 4 big area think lot getting back actually feel pretty good pretty interesting setup mentioned payment would argue last year alphabet payment strategy evolved somewhat time go sort think importance better linking transaction advertising dollar spent payment probably going get important maybe talk u learning sort rolled android pay different iteration past couple year sort 1 2 area really focus payment going forward q brian thomas nowak philipp schindleryes really interesting mentioning part linking transaction advertising piece lot people refer actually find interesting piece payment perspective sitting facilitating transaction piece accelerating making easier go back said beginning start decomposing business really work really want drive conversion rate one biggest driver moment mean room abandoned sort shopping cart process similar purchase process simply diï¬ƒcult use payment credential right think could drive example conversion rate approving simply payment ï¬‚ows think actually interesting upside one think way thinking payment really worthwhile spending time emerging market come payment moment seeing exciting development traditional established market see lot really exciting thing happening emerging market go even one successful one really interesting payment product actually launched india taken totally different look payment created conversational ui around payment call google pay used call tez time interesting development look number moment think 40 million monthly active product processing run rate think 60 billion transaction processing moment see u actually developing payment emerging market taking mature market obviously thinking value proposition user actually go significantly beyond traditional payment much whether loyalty site whether lot different area think really make payment successful need create new value proposition environment work closely obviously bank financial institution yes think interesting learning emerging market one upi certainly helped lot india couple question going open q question philipp raise hand mic runner running one emerging market point completely agree advertising side payment side alphabet pretty would argue aggressive investor sort make sure well positioned emerging market nonpayment advertising opportunity see emerging market potentially appreciated wall street community interesting asked think slightly differently like actually think like 1 focus come emerging market actually making existing core product successful even successful emerging market think upside search perspective youtube perspective map perspective android perspective actually think pretty significant course differentiated investment emerging market talked payment example india q brian thomas nowak philipp schindlergive another one created product called file file google also launched india actually coming back u.s. getting think also 40 million monthly active range one coming back u.s. really interesting really interesting development well product perspective underestimate role existing product emerging market number one monetization aspect advertising potential emerging market also interesting look market depends little definition seeing transition growth rate oï¬ „ ine online digital growth rate 30 rate overall market talking specifically overall market discount bet transition opportunity bet smbs emerging market want connected consumer similar first point made business connecting business big focus smbs consumer time obviously local monetization opportunity probably evolving differently mature market team ground lot investment want make sure miss many case might actually take back mature market yes exciting bet mature product traditional monetization system got last one jim ellen like discussion regulation privacy never shortage topic sometimes joke tell bos need lawyer team sort keep everything going maybe perspective talk u seen europe gdpr thing changed changed maybe potential comment around potentially copyright law eu yes look mean working data protection authority many many many year closely involved obviously working gdpr challenge interesting development course extremely pro privacy want create privacy safe environment consumer single doubt supportive gdpr context think interesting observation environment much amount time invest invested lot time energy getting system ready gdpr think interesting observation amount time effort maybe even underestimated little bit long took u help partner ecosystem get ready gdpr whether advertiser side publisher side ad tech platform side industry consortium think touched 12,000 different player 1.5 year two year took u get ready gdpr think overall investment something like 400 person year something meaningful feel comfortable effort done always valued privacy put extremely extremely high level gdpr development asked copyright piece well copyright reform side always clear supportive copyright reform beneficial broader ecosystem mean q brian thomas nowak q unidentified participant philipp schindler q unidentified participant philipp schindlerit need beneficial user need beneficial creator need beneficial platform course current development would say creates certain level uncertainty far clear implementation first still ratified fully far clear detailed implementation member state side definitely uncertainty around would say pretty good managing uncertainty look managed gdpr lot uncertainty beginning think done pretty well would say trust ability right thing user manage complex uncertainty question philipp want go back youtube minute tell u roughly let say look united state metaphor many people go youtube country every day much time average user spend youtube every day would measure revenue per user compared traditional mass medium respect time spent revenue conversion recall latest public number correctly think somewhere range 8 1.8 billion logged user moment around globe global number think break u.s. number youtube actually really interesting significant percentage watch time user mobile device 50 watch time actually sitting mobile device give fact publicly shared product watch time perspective moment youtube living room product watching referred brieï¬‚y watching youtube big television screen course good understanding revenue metric call marquee metric lot different way look yes understand metric quite well think microphone ca hear like understand also mean many people measure measure much potential youtube know simple example grandson watch tv 12 year old okay either youtube netï¬‚ix spends 2 3 hour day using one 100 different reason lot people future asking help understanding mean business sure know like understand got make investment q brian thomas nowak q unidentified participant philipp schindler q brian thomas nowak q unidentified participant philipp schindler q unidentified participantfirst grateful grandson passionate youtube user thank much observation sharing observation hearing quite often probably reï¬‚ected number gave think youtube business interesting business look exactly explained thank giving u insight feel trend going continue describing question google sits obviously lot data mostly use monetize advertising think using data also towards direction example finance field data could monetized quite well well let clear 1 priority keep user data safe secure handle way possible invested really really heavily last year many many year one sophisticated personally think sophisticated privacy system look transparency control perspective look product like google privacy dashboard look product like google takeout launched respectively 2009 2011 1 priority course data used advertising system doubt nothing specific announce time come using different environment see u yet anything ever company would violate 1 principle talked making sure everything used privacy respectful way one know patiently waiting think ... ca hear without microphone sorry think changing competitive landscape amazon instagram increasingly moving product listing advertising within last year philipp schindler q brian thomas nowak philipp schindler whenever new inventory pool made available advertiser generates positive roi usually take look something interested healthy competitive dynamic see especially case mentioned especially amazon side lot budget addressed moment trade promo type budget budget historically actually shifted rate speed online world even budget access much historically actually something could say discussion beginning around total addressable market think actually might accelerate shift oï¬ „ ine towards online would beneficial broader ecosystem including look interesting part significant percentage consumer journey still starting shopping discovery perspective google something feel comfortable brieï¬‚y talked fact lot term ui creating really amazing commercial experience user shopping environment overall think pretty good position great right thanks lot philipp thank much thank thank much appreciate
