okay think live keith bachman bmo thrilled microsoft mike spencer joined u today may participate already group session formal fireside chat mike thanks much agreeing participate yeah question answer going going jump mostly vertical industry business unit specific question wanted ask one question come industry level jump business unit segment edge microsoft think first talk intelligent edge company like frankly fortinet jumped little bit give u backdrop talk intelligent edge really mean architectural perspective think benefit microsoft threatens microsoft yeah great question keith thanks thanks would say edge heard satya amy past several year highlighted satya talking gosh going probably three year constantly refer intelligent edge intelligent cloud satya really mean brings phrase notion moving world believe thing interaction database customer service structure company operates et cetera computing interaction q keith bachman michael spencergoing pushed edge historically would running server via web moving mobile device moving thermostat house moving center manufacturing line moving device like hololens allows remote oversight technical standpoint compute get pushed edge going actually result several thing one distributed architecture compute taking place see continued shift time folk going demand edge responsiveness leaf thing like cosmos db distributed database architecture replicates localized basis closer edge accessed mean sensor device lead higher amount data collection obviously whole set positive implication associated thing like machine learning artificial intelligence et cetera well compute hand think phone evolution phone use basically run almost entire productivity stack directly phone day obviously always going role pc whatnot going see architecture get distributed across refer intelligent edge see u focus customer really end business going operate future serve reduction latency ability push power edge harnessing data going critical move forward okay okay okay well probably good segue pbv going go business unit business unit one thing discussed last couple year small line item called oﬃce oﬃce 365 particular want jump past quarter growth slowed pretty materially oﬃce 365 commercial 22 growth constant currency seat growth kind 15 versus 20 last 20 percent last four quarter transactional part business talk little bit happened quarter importantly runway see next 12 month opportunity set microsoft economy little bit tough think integrating economy question talk little bit oﬃce 365 commercial particular yeah sure give couple different angle look first let talk seat dynamic probably saw unquote slowdown part business within seat slowdown actually pretty direct driver obviously previous quarter given moderate slowdown seen previous quarter within quarter number factor stuck seen previously first foremost introduction covid back march actually launched trial e1 trial really saw broad adoption much stronger adoption anticipated number customer especially lower tier customer opt trial q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachmansome portion would purchaser past month trial trial ended july 1st great job filling top funnel q4 counted seat job convert paid user first dynamic second going smb see like saw transactional side side business see transactional slowdown oﬃce 365 purchasing smb impacting factor third worker surprisingly environment customer looking furloughed worker maybe shuttered retail store example see enterprise customer slowing maybe coverage worker case lower worker previously much new seat statement existing seat turning something factor seat quarter said ﬂush normalize move forward baked guidance q1 importantly arpu remains strong variance revenue growth 22 called seat growth 15 give roughly 7 growth arpu implied arpu pretty consistent previous quarter spread last four quarter 7 9 range big driver continuing monitor closely see good momentum market continued upsell e3 e3 folk coming equation also e5 upsell starting take hold called q3 march quarter saw momentum continue q4 become material factor move forward well general think expectation move forward expect continued seat growth although continued moderation like seeing importantly arpu start become bigger mix equation feel good momentum formula intact going see dimension change little bit get arpu seat growth thesis economic condition improve seat growth improves given current economic environment seat growth probably remains thinking wrong calibration think relatively right ballpark thing would tell obviously guide specific number growth biggest factor called number one factor trial dynamic michael spencer q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachman michael spenceryeah obviously gone ended trial july 1st exactly could kind remove factor table think smb dimension seeing well around worker trend broader environment would expect change okay okay well let shift mix second way think two different dimension one within oﬃce 365 two e3 two e5 one dimension also microsoft 365 another pull maybe remind difference oﬃce 365 microsoft 365 let talk arpu opportunity talked seven point sound like remains kind way think model next 12 month maybe talk two aspect oﬃce 365 microsoft 365 yeah definition standpoint would encourage folk sku map available website oﬃce 365 microsoft 365 lay pretty clearly short way think oﬃce 365 going core workload everyone think grown know love e1 exchange online base e3 suite oﬃce e5 brings telephony security thing like move across stack microsoft 365 two component added window em em enterprise mobility security suite e3 premium version e5 em around stickiness mature attached oﬃce 365 window newest equation relatively newest equation window e3 give window enterprise think commercial customer go buy pc want put window enterprise machine buy window pro machine department upgrade window enterprise give overlay control structure associated window move stack window e5 brings security layer threat protection window right kind two vector think vertically stack within oﬃce 365 e1 e3 e5 horizontal vertical across stack microsoft 365 e3 microsoft 365 e5 q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachman michael spenceri would tell two different thing seeing market one environment team security really pushed momentum seeing e5 side thing folk moving softphone associated cloud pbx team offering well security resonating maybe ever lead dog e5 environment becoming forefront dialogue second thing would say hero motion evolved time go back history original hero motion e1 customer move exchange online still maintain oﬃce evolved oﬃce 365 e3 today customer coming oﬃce 365 really going microsoft 365 e3 really become hero motion clarity purpose important understand revenue associated window revenue associated em land respective unit window portion microsoft 365 land window commercial em land inside azure saas portion azure important aspect understand see good momentum surface arpu story within oﬃce 365 talked surface part dialogue versus broader horizontal play get microsoft 365 said penetration trade oﬃce 365 e3 versus e5 last stat gave keith year back said 60 premium could e3 could e5 could e1 plus oﬃce online gotten lot feedback investigating might update stat anything new share okay also offer bundle buy e3 also buy separately security bundle right specific skus getting traction people environment moving saying e5 aggressive momentum actually finding people buying individual skus yeah great question journey e5 earlier much standalone specific sku think advanced threat protection solid seller audio conferencing solid seller specific workload year change ago 16 month ago let call 15 16 month ago introduced security bundle compliance bundle around 8 8 9 ca remember exact price intended capture value security structure compliance structure within e5 started see good success technical diﬃculty e5 really believe two plus workload e5 q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachmanand quite tipping scale full suite sale changed team really brought telephony forefront telephony hunting along security compliance believer two three enough tip overall scale keep mind number customer already believer power bi tends little bit departmental sale broad coverage play two tend coverage play really led success past six month talked last couple earnings call full e5 suite sale forefront versus standalone workload component yeah mean one question often get microsoft monetize team way think heavy force gravity take e5 bundle right way think certainly direct way monetize important understand dimension seeing team usage couple fold one saw good early adoption audio conferencing mentioned earlier seeing remote environment customer wanting take advantage softphone within team coming heel change made year half ago introduced kind called bring trunk enterprise customer know legacy relationship t orange world good deal usually pstn offering standpoint business everyone know minute commoditized business offer minute package folk add e5 something going lucrative business u 9 time 10 enterprise customer base get better deal directly telco u minute notion bring trunk e5 offering take advantage cloud pbx softphone offering within e5 really pushed u forefront going stop folk like ringcentral example 8x8 others would offer softphone structure top broader minute package using public apis see customer seeing viral effect team take place saying wow really take advantage take advantage softphone offering make fully encompassed best user experience get team really led momentum okay yeah team certainly getting lot traction mentioned pre call bmo standardized team certainly pushing forward staying within pbv favorite actually dynamic way comment made past still think microsoft underserved dynamic reason draw conclusion call 3 microsoft revenue 3 market share market serve mind good enough right michael spencerbecause microsoft think satya still brings lot conference call dynamic become relevant great question keith appreciate would say couple thing could talk strategy d365 specifically dynamic business shown steady growth past couple year passed 3 billion fy importantly d365 majority revenue growing pretty healthy clip last quarter think 42 something almost 38 close 40 growth feel good momentum core saas business attached motion expansion motion beyond core saas offering spend time talking natural path penetration inside enterprise space would say couple thing think strategy around d365 given level excitement hear satya talk much biz app space obviously crm online business go pretty formidable opponent got lot incumbency enterprise customer share win battle every single time go still really focused core growth aspect business second thing though need land crm online socket able land broader d365 functional structure meaning surround competitor offering within customer finance operation hr talent marketing line business application start expand footprint dynamic 365 customer base led success well last piece growing way customer look really push digital transformation necessarily love term broad customer look automate various line within structure functional apps become super important last piece power platform specifically within think power apps power automate rpa structure well power virtual agent customer service automation low code code environment close d365 super nascent market still growing rapidly seeing number smaller company arena customer really start push envelope transforming use term seeing reliance able carry water given shortage developer migrate workload public cloud super excited space seen success customer like chevron gone viral quickly see building block land expand motion offering d365 feel like got tenant place execution serving customer q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachman distribution sfa salesforce automation versus rest hr accounting financial accounting rather difference two broad bucket difference mix standpoint yeah mix exactly yeah disclosed ca really give lot color tell though two bucket versus power platform majority d365 okay compete say chevron would thought category forgetting sfa second would thought mostly smb say sorry maybe mixed apple orange say compete talking within functional application yeah within application hr f marketing activity would thought would mostly smb aligned yeah going well going would say market upper market going see usually based able integrate broader solution across function broader process across function really smb targeted priced smb targeted really look land expand motion surrounding somebody like crm going line business function automate process integrate crm structure okay maybe end come back second migrate ic segment let talk azure think little bit disappointment last quarter although industrial expectation shape michael spenceraround always interesting maybe talk component growth azure want remind u particularly dissect model versus model dynamic lack better word play helping u think growth potential sure hear heard feedback loud clear level anticipation azure reminding folk came actually expected q4 pleased actually slightly fx headwind q4 originally guided factored little bit general component talking also intact business growth standpoint first obviously saas business continues moderate see seat number provide seat growth quarter 30 low 30 range look sku price mean em e3 sku 9 use enterprise discount encourage folk math p time sku look like see piece business moderating material driver slowdown q4 q4 always seasonal heavy period em standpoint surprise iaa paas side business see thing would say q4 carry forward peaked think peaked little bit q4 obviously give implied guide q1 first foremost saw see slowdown impacted industry come iaa paas think hospitality travel thing like second thing see saw optimization within customer base might normally historically seen optimization always core tenant customer migrate public cloud one first step take within workload move refining workload find thing like reserved instance thing like saw bit q4 expect continue easy way customer ensure getting bang dollar buying iaa pas last piece see ebb ﬂow customer case accelerating migration public cloud case looking prioritizing workload saying hey maybe moving erp system use example particular point might introduce little bit risk appetite given moving part little bit occurred q4 well within line expectation keep mind provided guidance q4 already end april already point six week kind covid dynamic thing largely played way expected big thing q4 surprise pleasant surprise highlighted show revenue q4 sale actually stronger anticipated go back april dialogue actually anticipated slowdown larger azure deal expected customer maybe hold back little bit commitment actually saw opposite q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachman michael spencerwe saw customer actually push harder larger commitment azure really showed see rpo came q4 rpo specifically higher growth rate rpo important aspect keep mind think iaa paas equation overall customer commitment never wavered actually increased quarter great sign moving forward keith second half question guide q4 implies kind mid lower mid growth percentage azure depending want believe component lot trend talk going consistent saas slowdown talked optimization phase see trend around impacted industry et cetera baked guidance feel pretty good momentum going forward continued growth especially consumption side business found helpful benchmark aws growth azure growth point time revenue track growth rate actually pretty good proxy obviously come frankly large number impact growth let talk little bit competition seeing aws perhaps google seeing term workload word natural workload migrate b pricing yeah great question would say largely macro level competitive landscape whole lot changed see aws everywhere go head pretty much every deal obviously gcp popped bit past month bit targeted obviously lever really go price seen also tend see gcp aws go bit kind heavier devops environment think silicon valley startup type environment azure gcp compete devops try really focused trying push see aws gcp go space u would say point though around kind specific workload would actually pivot bit bit talked little bit workload obviously lot success area like retail good example seen google actually talk retail space well versus think aws lot success seen called public acknowledgement extension legacy business growing extending future speaks lead q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachman michael spencermarket first gate seeing benefit carryover would say anything look forward vocal offering around thing like data service super optimistic database offering lot going like cosmos db quantum computing offering within think lot ai functionality really starting come fold announced lot enhancement around thing like agriculture oil gas really focused development around ai functionality continue see last piece seen press little bit well passed every security clearance needed go classified structure within u government obviously led lot dialogue governmental space across geographic landscape optimistic moving forward sale standpoint really putting technical solution sale specialist well vertical solution sale specialist market seeing come lot described okay mentioned government want ask jedi contract think skip since sure say much say guy read press like satya last call said azure cloud limitless data analytics trying highlight capability see area message satya highlight something extent reason would think particular google data side analytics side take lot pride extreme great capability think aggregate portfolio microsoft suggests competitive advantage data analytics azure yeah mean obviously legacy database infrastructure offering sql feel good competitive landscape standpoint natural transition azure standpoint feel good competitive positioning right highlight gcp formidable area get market recognition general though would say lot seeing data offering especially around quantum offering within azure going see push customer base really go large set data either locked process building aggregating q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachmanright circle back first question asked today keith around intelligent edge amount data volume coming customer base larger anything ever experienced past coming every way think remote environment amount data interaction point interfacing either home road oﬃce growing exponentially satya talk limitless data really talking ability customer harness insight power data actually provide able use advantage azure able help achieve really goal end day offering set kind go across structure thing like azure arc allows give visibility across entire portfolio well cloud data obviously core architecture ability go utilize ai harness data core anything going success ai standpoint going data solve equation everything else kind becomes second point really going limit unless go hearing satya leaning okay microsoft talk also lot security number different point security part competitive advantage relates azure specifically broader really orient around azure well mean obviously core component azure thing like azure sentinel example core offering super aggressive security much broader play vocal offering across security market kind several different aspect give first obviously identity socket u azure active directory compete going first core tenant move thing like threat protection becomes super important ability go folk like proofpoint et cetera detect manage endpoint detect threat may coming sort angle environment point circling back intelligent edge environment super important aspect third thing going going focus around cloud security like said earlier azure sentinel overall security cloud estate look like becomes critical aspect last piece going around overall estate productivity side thing security built existing application well general would say security broad play u em lead security offering talked saas side thing also embedded azure offering well specific security service like azure sentinel michael spencer q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachman michael spencerokay okay fair enough let shift gear little bit commercial cloud gross margin last quarter think plus 1 66 amy think suggested gross margin continue expand maybe pace slow given mixed issue walk one mixed issue liberty next quarter quarter thereafter investor think commercial cloud gross margin yeah great question would say first foremost basic important obviously whenever looking number normalize useful life change accounting change yeah yeah trying take yeah point question obviously take broader audience important make sure understand second thing would say anomaly team usage q4 important folk understand gotten number question around oﬃce 365 margin important understand beauty network architecture usage increase specific product kind half inﬂated tyre structure azure benefit able allocate usage capacity team utilize charged obviously team p l oﬃce 365 p l ebb ﬂow question commercial cloud gross margin best metric look within several factor one continue improve across saas service although started reach steady state closer steady state incremental improvement business become smaller move forward case 365 quarter actually quarter important understand iaa paas though importantly continue make material improvement azure business expect continue overall mix shift towards iaa paas take place going put additional downward pressure commercial cloud gross margin heard amy talk expect continued improvement moderated pace look forward right talking continued improvement next quarter opportunity 67 whatever longer term opportunity yeah q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachman michael spencer okay way change depreciation schedule like excited one yes hear maybe want jump go back orientation le around consumer activity tiktok something talked year say application business application side particular area satya mentioned couple different time want nurture business still something consideration say perhaps inorganic help help drive incremental business mean obviously ca comment anything specific would say broadly though single business inside microsoft always evergreen constant dialogue around organic inorganic option help grow business strategy standpoint biz apps dynamic little different would would never say never obviously piece know standpoint valuation one component important component look others even growing market better owner good fit culturally check box valuation make sense always exploring would never say anything table obviously ca specific okay let shift mpc excuse actually going jump gaming console launch thesis new console launch going probably huge catalyst stock revenue profile given game going backwards compatible necessarily need upgrade addition game halo may different time trend think investor thinking console potential driver business within framework gaming think look previous launch trend around console cycle u think good benchmark think two thing think come upcoming console launch one folk seen good highlighted current crisis console sale actually stronger anything anticipated going enter console launch q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachman michael spencercycle upcoming holiday period leaner inventory previous cycle help keep mind folk going upgrade going kind two camp folk going upgrade one folk want latest greatest smaller portion audience second folk still oﬃce xbox 360 versus moving xbox one still sizable number folk console going two primary driver general say one thing key dimension upcoming cycle momentum around game pas launch xcloud yeah next question yeah going broader would say buzz market around launch xcloud momentum around game pas really started take hold talked 10 million subscriber back april cycle six month folk remote environment imagine momentum gotten feel good dimension launching xcloud game pas mean overall gaming business right would say keith though back original question percentage mix standpoint console smaller mix ever think top line revenue important dimension keep mind yeah going broaden question hit mean seems like thesis around microsoft gaming revenue line item evolving narrative investor thinking go subscription want say annuity business ongoing revenue source struggled digit grower next year obviously quarter coming going higher last quarter substantially higher trying normalize investment thesis around microsoft gaming business look next two year yeah perfect question would actually point q4 symbolic hope business pushing business go really great thing q4 performance gaming siloed hit theme go back last couple year obviously fortnite spiky nature game saw high saw low look back q2 last year terrible q2 gaming fortnite comp saw q4 saw strength fortnite actually saw couple title come fold balanced dimension strength thing like minecraft title like sea thief game pas momentum q keith bachman michael spencer q keith bachmanand point balance ecosystem solid foundation recurring revenue stream game pas moving forward help balance high low well distribution first third party title know heavily investing portfolio obviously mitigate moving forward volatility hit party hit game dimension seen past really think business goal going though want make sound like going something going achieve going journey next year yeah think helpful kind smooth well 17 question ask mike think point see clock upper right take opportunity thank time wish best luck look forward chatting soon yeah thank keith appreciate okay cheer good day everyone
