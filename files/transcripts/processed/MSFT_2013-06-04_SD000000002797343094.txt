thank much coming conference muggy san francisco delighted able introduce next company bob kelly corporate vice president microsoft server tool business inaudible ir department bob going talking business minute open question answer bob take stage thank kash appreciate good see everybody kash mentioned name bob kelly microsoft almost 17 year done everything possibly imagine server tool business pretty wild time segment right wanted set framing essentially think server tool business one expecting since know little secret little secret rest world business almost 19 billion large let tell little bit see going ecosystem course presentation fact contain statement take thing remember server tool business first really big business 19 billion business microsoft cagr 11 pretty stunning look underneath hardware market year server hardware market going decline growing 11 point market actually declining really pretty shocking strong business company contribution margin continues grow nearly 50 healthy business getting healthier every year six separate 1 billion business within server tool business remarkable statement started server tool window server shipping 3,000 unit month business got six separate 1 billion business across management database o category phenomenal achievement yet also continuing grow share position grown 4 point last year market share versus vmware market sql server premium skus growing greater 20 last five quarter window azure new addition portfolio added 50 service last year remarkable remarkable success story actually one think really set next phase growth thing want understand though see think understand see help frame want look success failure really four fundamental transformational trend occurring ecosystem trend built sort underpinning virtualization compute storage network computer storage network virtualization four trend see outside ring important actually trend forming strategic direction taking server tool business first new social app pattern see facebook twitter pinterest linkedin massive scale new social application pattern really driven whole new set verb like share intelligence built search really intelligent application new paradigm application built consumer application new kind apps finding way commercial sector well data explosion staggering statistic 90 world data created last two year iec predicting 44x growth data next five year could either daunting thing hit customer tremendous opportunity drive new application new scenario around insight viewing think actually really unique opportunity data becomes new platform tool around data oﬃce 365 bi category really become powerful customer actually derive new value new scenario business consumerization many carrying smart phone ipad maybe even surface dear god consumerization reality something true every one u bringing device business expect application huge burden build new system secure manage stay compliant corporate policy device control 2015 forecasted 2x number smart device people planet new reality business deal new reality finally cloud computing exploding like crazy whether window azure aws google cloud platform salesforce rackspace tremendous capacity built much capacity trend really unique opportunity create new value go drive transformational change within industry within customer responding aggressively call cloud o modern platform world apps fundamentally happening new world going require new way managing system new way deploying service new way today think resource management operating system global scale system distributed across million server order deliver need transformational trend modern platform world apps fundamentally transforms data center need think data center four wall customer owns instead wall logical wherever application new cloud o take account data center redefined enables empowers people centric turn actually device important actually user experience user become center way around long central made decision user new world user making decision deal manage secure comply new platform unlock insight data small big whatever kind data want key insight data per se really derive new pattern emerging new ability actually see shocking amount data otherwise three year ago would thrown away discarded actually keep data actually really interesting thing find user business therefore take better action finally modern platform also enables whole new class business application cloud o really whole new construct longer thinking thing singular machine vast distributed fabric enables whole new class application whole new case user scenario fact new way thinking make cloud o unique microsoft approach cloud o one consistent platform span customer data center data center third party service provider one consistent platform allows customer deploy application solution infrastructure want expect certain level consistency cloud o enables ﬂexible development really mean support dot net way support running linux fabric support php java fact today scale flexible development mean also developer customer build application decide deploy later way customer want build application want build deploy wherever see fit based business need cloud o also need unified management approach unified management approach mean single pane glass company look asset matter deployed premise premise third party really important part end day today think data center tomorrow logical boundary need able manage asset one single pane glass part need common identity fabric meaning need able log set asset deployed anywhere planet able federate across multiple platform need integrated virtualization across platform one common layer virtualizing part stack premise premise third party service provider finding complete data platform cloud o absolutely unique actually enables set capability premise customer want deploy application solution u talking tremendous momentum tremendous momentum going see slide lot ampersand really mean approach fundamentally approach approach private cloud public cloud microsoft service provider fundamentally approach 93 fortune 1000 use active directory primary log window azure active directory 265 billion authentication software 3 million entity corporation business using azure active directory 46 database deployed world using sql server 300,000 sql azure database window azure similarly 76 enterprise apps using window server 100,000 website hosted window azure core strategy deliver fabric cloud o allows customer deploy solution see fit really q kash rangancritical customer tell u every single day get way running business must able actually see fit based whatever rule regulation play tremendous year product momentum tremendous whether window server 2012 system center 2012 neutralized playing ground vmware competitive offering go take bunch share sql server 2012 really upped game show significant revenue growth share adoption database category window intune management server sas offering managing pc environment tremendously successful product u accelerating growth category course next 12 month significant product coming well addition said 50 new service delivered window azure year yesterday announced whole new set update window azure well tech ed event new orleans window server system center blue heard window client side window blue window 8.1 also server release coming timeframe bring bunch innovation around window azure server release customer take advantage window azure deploy premise sql server 14 feature called always backup meaning actually literally continuous backup window azure customer therefore disaster recovery solution built box cloud bi visual studio window intune key product innovate reiterate course next 12 month quick view frame server tool business lens cloud o lot different category play database category o category management category incredibly successful world move new demand imperative customer tell u imperative fabric enables deploy solution anywhere see fit going pause sit take q thank question answer thanks much bob ask couple question feel free jump question well heard lot work azure guy azure amazon web service talking infrastructure bob kelly q kash rangan bob kelly inaudible strategy well see azure playing alongside aws going conversation guy different segment market see unique strength point differentiation versus amazon web service see couple different thing one first foremost lot buzzword around cloud infrastructure service platform service software service different way thinking core capability platform real term infrastructure service sort current application model delivered rented vm cloud platform service set managed apis window azure delivers full set platform service capability full set infrastructure service capability meaning customer actually deploy existing application model new application model window azure feel good built reason think actually going successful versus amazon really end day think targeting enterprise customer first amazon targeting startup first two different starting point trying denigrate business done successful job really capturing momentum around startup ecosystem presence enterprise space amazon owns consumer credit card microsoft owns enterprise credit card establish beach hold customer actually extend data center window azure using ia pad think really really strong position differentiated offer versus aws got hear lot private cloud public cloud guy public cloud offering also product load offering enable product data center see customer spending amount investment dollar going towards public cloud private cloud interestingly called hybrid cloud inaudible well obviously based strategy think end state notion hybrid cloud cloud third party cloud given life cycle adoption public cloud technology relatively early life cycle vast majority least spend server tool 19 billion software customer deploying premise early sign strong momentum last year stood told 100,000 customer window azure today 200,000 adding 1,000 customer day 30,000 customer adopted infrastructure service offering q kash rangan bob kelly q kash rangan bob kellywent live april really seen tremendous momentum 50 fortune 500 least one application window azure strong momentum additionally look software sell cloud software server tool business either delivered azure delivered service provider 1 billion trailing 12 month seen really solid momentum tremendous capability private cloud huge revenue starting see early sign software delivered window azure service provider getting scale long way go really good start look business model inaudible inaudible like inaudible business model azure public inaudible offering versus private ratable inaudible acquisition versus license know core server tool business majority business structured programming contract ratably recognized look incremental value azure deal versus regular server tool deal breakeven revenue dollar perspective margin dollar perspective gained give put take one question know rally going answer yes going answer different question put context today server tool business 20 billion revenue category enterprise software 100 billion 100 billion participates total 2 trillion business think happening actually entire 2 trillion dusted entire 2 trillion grab going major winner major loser transition okay actually look cannibalistic substitution risk look really significant potential revenue margin dollar growth second thing remember every analyst ever looked say 70 every enterprise dollar going maintaining existing system 30 new capability could unlock ability deliver backlog apps huge opportunity well seeing actually see cloud thing additive business subtractive strong position premise contract able monetize transition hybrid world eﬃciently effectively q kash rangan bob kelly q kash rangan bob kellyso macro playing way bigger pool believe fundamentally additive getting today transition rate customer want u feel look large enterprise got 7,000 using azure application workload running azure seeing everything right obviously see everything cheeseburger zingali consumer facing application go core enterprise see application like company called easyjet easyjet company europe basically seasonal ﬂights kind core business model way used spring ship bunch server people site airport stand system collect fee collect ticket collapse go well actually handheld scanner use window azure giant service bus cloud integrated mainframe cloud fabric allows completely transform business using existing asset got company like milliman monte carlo simulation actually need tremendous compute capacity demand stand thousand compute node run simulation pas answer deﬂate different application pattern real also see boeing built consumer facing experience immersive wanted show dreamliner wanted consumer facing experience sort see thing like built really rich client fed application everything see core transaction capability application prem moving cloud well got inaudible talk industry talking management automation oﬃcer top virtual machine installed big vm install base view management opportunity microsoft going monetize look idc data idc share north 30 vmware share 55 number correct said grown point quarter course last four quarter aggressive growth get point essence enterprise space two platform customer based world esx based world q kash rangan bob kelly q kash rangan bob kellythe money hyper visor money automation management system portfolio one 1 billion category important piece way monetize importantly also important piece strategy cloud o cloud o construct deploy application wherever see fit whatever suit need best system center single pane glass allows manage monitor provision update application wherever sit strategy really fundamentally unlocking power cloud o final thing say customer want migrate competing stack system center manage esx manage provision infrastructure customer decides move seeing customer seen tremendous interest let say way still released 2012 last tremendous interest customer moving deploying next esx course next 12 18 month bullish database industry vertical gain share database industry absolutely latter thing happening across ecosystem said option well option think say think look revenue growing 20x look industry database category growing 6 7 8 somewhere range growing anywhere 2 3x market good start okay competitor stronger position category revenue standpoint worked strong product strong momentum additionally look public cloud space unlimited opportunity u application kind migrate new world delivering database service whole notion tier 1 apps get disrupted iceberg oracle hold enterprise start melt melt market moving public cloud way consume deliver service chipping away q kash rangan bob kelly q kash rangan bob kelly q kash rangan bob kelly q kash rangan turn audience thought open source initiative open stack closed stack feel customer whether want microsoft participating say complicated answer first honestly think open stack chance success public cloud reason say economics public cloud extraordinary scale order derive deliver economics ﬂat true player going scale microsofts amazon google maybe salesforces far huge capital outlay huge commitment someone take openstack successful public cloud one bigs would take openstack completely weld thing offer way ever get scale real usage public cloud look private cloud think actually openstack likely shot gaining traction somewhat good reason mean ecosystem historically never wanted raced prefers race could race great think enough momentum around openstack like plaeda hp others private cloud different dynamic like chance world firmly believe public cloud space one wo momentum inaudible private cloud customer pausing evaluating openstack would assessment maturity openstack vi guy product inaudible someone could find customer deployed openstack scale like talk apparently ebay using inaudible ebay bob kelly q kash rangan q unidentified participant bob kelly q unidentified participantyes yes know know chance talk hard find awful lot interest openstack awful lot deployment big difference quite frankly move forward need system center integration customer demand afraid stretch imagination see enough momentum behind yet see lot noise got okay point question audience first china azure platform versus awf talk little bit partner chose expected uptake one core responsibility actually china specifically delivering window azure offering china company chosen work 21vianet essentially really four player could work telco 21v real term imperative work local company part parcel take actually operate china comply local regulation et cetera also imperative u way actually beneficial ecosystem large 21v number one hoster data center operator china chose specific reason unending upside u china unending upside know massive piracy challenge across microsoft software particularly china steve said time past cost company billion dollar year lot profit could utilized lot good way much harder steal service steal packaged software service going absolutely key success china excited early momentum inaudible redbox whole bunch really great customer adopted u china hopefully later year general availability talk growth seeing azure revenue growing opportunity microsoft think customer perspective roi customer getting going azure compare platform q kash rangan q unidentified participant bob kelly q kash rangan roi funny end day something compare really customer tell u looking azure looking azure actually agility cost reduction actually fundamentally ca deliver need deliver current construct even server virtualization still take long provision environment provision application architecture et cetera instant capability get application much faster actually first thing seeing actually agility like tcr roi customer inaudible look like whereas premise world look like tell roi et cetera public cloud least experience look like yet given relation mean given install base important premise today little bit conﬂict interest guess trying maintenance dollar essentially maintenance dollar could paid guy buy product buying product decade little bit conﬂict interest might manage may best positioned manage trying grow essentially disruptive really disruptive technology kind conversation typically customer really turn everyone familiar andreessen said right software going eat world look 2 trillion spend vast majority software thing maintenance people cost thing actually software automate really play much conﬂict interest really much fact talked software automation sometimes get people saying mean job right problem every time occurred job created fewer happens shift people work people sort plugging together thing could automate always sort value software conversation scenario unlock use public cloud lay staff rarely hear anything like question growth rate business far server unit growth rate help u break gap growth rate server unit growth rate bob kelly q kash rangan bob kelly q kash rangan bob kelly thing glad asked question another important way think going microsoft thinking play course last 18 month fundamentally changed way license database os/management product database always licensed per pc per box ﬂip per core o went per box per cpu virtualization core density much power box customer buy many box therefore monetizing eﬃciently ﬂipping core cpu actually able eﬃciently monetize fewer box common unit monetization across private cloud public cloud two important part going market actually drive value even shrinking hardware market monetizing eﬃciently second big thing done timing made transition well 12 18 month depends release talking sql 18 month inaudible window 10 month ago okay second big thing happening seeing tremendous shift premium skus combination density desire customer soak box longer licensing packaging around premium skus shifting dollar per unit dramatically assuming rough map 200,000 customer azure 1 billion run rate big amount money per customer work 5,000 box sure pretty big distribution customer spend lot money lot le money adoption cycle relative customer budget azure slotted would customer think spending money new project answer second question first absolutely new project absolutely see dollar slowing everyone carrying device around every app get mobilized whole new set scenario coming apps data bi huge scenario unlocked customer saying new apps first thing q kash rangan bob kelly q kash rangan bob kelly q kash rangan bob kellythe second thing look early early early cycle transition 2 trillion even take aws 2 billion take u whatever number want take u still rounding error overall category early cycle play long period time material material going take time u see burn surprised nobody asked rackspace another infrastructure service company inaudible lead analyst stock ever see rackspace contender enterprise well first love rackspace mean great company really reason think great company unique value prop maniacal support lot customer pay maniacal support full stop technical capability software driven company like u point loyal customer base penetration enterprise course app scale advantage cost structure quite frankly think appetite think real player like end day would trade position got insightful thank much good see product azure thank customer coming multiple speaker thanks everybody appreciate thank time presence well great day thank
