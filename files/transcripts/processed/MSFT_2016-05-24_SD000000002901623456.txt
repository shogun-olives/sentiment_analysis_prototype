strategy continue mark murphy dave mark murphy dave think select acquisition augment offering job put together way make sense customer good strategy continue pursue opportunity technical diﬃculty technical diﬃculty let talk moment transactional versus annuity business think broadly see many sign microsoft net consolidator spend across industry whole lot new area gaining scale gaining share excuse market recent quarter think clear core fundamental remain solidly attached everything annuity everything cloud mentioned larger expected decline transactional business think part included server business actually okay want ask question first one technical diﬃculty well transactional across oﬃce product server product oﬃce server geography think curious almost every company mentioning russia brazil china emerging market generally saw issue extend beyond yes part couple data point publish one commercial business perspective 86 revenue annuity percentage growing push get people annuity versus annuity piece transactional piece natural transition get accounted little differently think move somewhat away annuity see goodness also weakness reason mentioned mark brazil russia etc market le annuity mark murphy dave mark murphy dave mark murphyso talking 86 across commercial business certain geos transaction heavy would couple geos transaction heavy step back think happened transactional trying weigh could could largely macro could effect transition cloud using guide try understand driving dynamic sure think two thing certainly two think geo ﬂavor also versus annuity think lot customer trying figure going going go cloud going go cloud look like technical diﬃculty maybe stepping back saying let take view working think thing contributed probably little softer transaction business expected gut feel whether transaction softness intensifies abates maybe determine going forward well think contributing factor goal really make sure microsoft customer whether

existing competitor think market overall grow analyst digit maybe little stronger would certainly expect get share see growth market term license database also think sql azure grow along size market well look sql really look sql across cloud perspective certainly expect pick share along way perspective provide thought key success factor sustained competitive advantage service sustained competitive advantage service think need infrastructure support service big cloud build need service easy set easy digest easy use state obvious point need service people want think microsoft perspective term think competitive differentiation enterprise perspective account trusted relationship expensive build take long time hard replicate got think got right service right strategy relationship customer infrastructure transaction slowdown much versus hard parse get much precision go say okay much due shift annuity estimate much say much due thing like issue estimate much would say say transactional slowdown would also put context transactional slowdown around 100 million 12 billion mark murphy dave see armageddon stretch would say shift geo weakness probably little bit unknown tried build view future okay time dave thank kindly spending u great sure thanks mark thanks
