coming end month yes guess followed nvidia long time drastically different company nvidia yesterday right historically thought nvidia think company sell gpus dell hp world whereas getting automotive data center enterprise cloud hpc u today colette going kind walk u transformation guess pc component company overall solution company maybe start talking progress like trajectory stage see going sure thank nvidia definitely worked transforming away single pc platform concentration really key four market platform order take gpu technology platform effect across four market four market gaming enterprise computing cloud automotive following second quarter result gaming gaming pc revenue could stronger growing 50 year year market pc gaming quite vibrant excitement new game overall nvidia maxwell architecture well excitement coming around corner 4k monitor dx12 lot virtual reality excitement second market enterprise virtualization take overall technology leverage enterprise graphic design building rendering key also created technology virtualization using grid put actual gpu data center allowing concurrency gpu streaming environment application third market computing cloud focused data center focus parallel computing focusing clearly accelerating data center future would tesla brand architecture really using different component versus visual computing using overall computing capability overall platform last market exciting mobile automotive market currently providing infotainment system many car see road 8 million different car right nvidia technology center dashboard center console visual computing also building work term ada future assisted driving future overall drive platform pull together computing capability gpu visual computing together future car four different market working transformation several year investment overall unification investment profile type architecture four different market key market approach approaching software solution approach really surrounding overall ecosystem one market approach develop hold market many key part move forward continue concentrate four key market even saw first 2 quarter fiscal year overall revenue growth company first 2 quarter 4 5 sean vocke colette kress sean vockebut actually pull growth platform focus growth rate nearly 25 concentration market working really decoupled saw underlying pc market growth market several quarter really concentrating building business go forward question answer right thanks good introduction guess start largest opportunity guy gaming maybe help u understand big gaming business guy today expectation far growth yes gaming business u half overall business 2 billion concentrated pc gaming also strong attraction gamers across world concentrated actually one geography strong representation u european market well asia pacific even china overall china business represents good percentage overall gaming market well strong hold pc gaming time think future people think sizing overall pc gaming kind interesting perfect understanding big underlying platform nothing gpu provide provide set tool set driver set software connects directly overall software coming onto market actual game hit market people keep coming back buying overall gpus look outside resource looked way 2018 growth market probably thought near digit type growth fast grow period time continued innovation continued work developer gaming market would probably key excited growth okay thanks look gaming business see biggest driver business macro new game launch like call duty metal gear new hardware right like skylake refresh example colette kress sean vocke colette kress sean vocke colette kress well confusion game actually drive gaming market game continued advance last several generation caliber game continue come even last quarter probably two key game drove significant amount gaming time leveraged overall gaming platform see gaming volume continue probably getting ready holiday season important underestimate power underlying platform hardware hardware put together key feature gameworks worked software developer enable hard thing water fire hair movement type thing feature allow game look realistic though game real important underlying gamer work innovation key producing time time gamer population come back know innovation going right upcoming game thing developed market sure sense large gamer market today percentage pc versus gaming gaming pc probably largest overall platform gaming market gaming occurs every single different platform though everybody could form using overall gaming stem pc stem console tablet phone lot mobility term need ph strong gaming platform found pc one popular even find people gaming pc platform well console pc continued higher echelon overall gaming performance right look pc gaming base largely concentrated u asia europe maybe talk little bit yes great thing world u love working multiple different platform pc gamers console gamers lot sean vocke colette kress sean vocke colette kressin china china love overall pc platform gaming experience european also strong hold lot pc gaming well seen far last several quarter strength across different market growing quite nicely around world okay thanks look graphic business much success attribute guess solution versus share gain competition true duopoly discrete gpu gamers set gamers continue consistently come back overall gaming population discrete gpu percentage market looking market share close 80 driven platform platform gaming platform even regular pc general oem overall gamers u long time small gain amd lion share driving overall growth overall value deliver platform continuing maintain strong asp period time getting gamers continue upgrade gpu main driver overall gaming revenue overall gamers across world continue expand gaming take place strong broadband capability still many part world broadband still coming life see gamers wanting master also available sister country get expansion people entering pc gaming get gamers continue upgrade higher version really maintaining value asp driving majority overall revenue growth sure remind u asp done last year two asp remarkably grown period time average asp gaming gpus continues go upward still concentrate focus focus price focus delivering value term platform sean vocke colette kress sean vocke colette kress sean vockethen obviously lot press lot coverage around virtual reality maybe talk guy virtual reality effort maybe help help gpu business yes excitement virtual reality pc gaming go next complete immersion gaming experience lot key vendor coming holiday season post holiday season beginning 2016 headset take advantage virtual reality world key part headset need infrastructure inﬂuence overall experience many vendor come recommendation type gpu necessary take advantage virtual reality experience looking promote three top gpus take advantage virtual reality promotes better experience virtual reality experience pleased actual gpus called key infrastructure component see virtual reality market guess playing next year two obviously still nascent right guy seeing bigger percentage revenue look next year maybe 2017 believe next wave gaming market fast grows big get think going still see vendor really come market acceptance right use form pulled together continue advance sure see generation forward ph advance u think little bit early say big overall size definitely attest good portion gaming okay thanks guess switch little bit maybe ask dollar question guess reason folk room today maybe get thought pc oem business mean guy obviously used little bit soft second quarter want get thought see rest year playing heard mixed commentary conference far interested seeing take pc oem business today colette kress sean vocke colette kress yes pc oem business refer gpu pc and/or notebook generally selling component inside pc notebook little two year ago towards end fiscal year 2013 business probably represented mid 20 overall company overall size revenue material percentage finishing last quarter pc oem business almost single digit percentage revenue continued able grow top line concentrated market something going focus going something going continue provide gpus build design understand going go wave pocket stabilization saw definitely end q2 growth actual decline year year able move platform approach allowed u piece business okay thanks guess want switch gear little bit focus enterprise another segment guy obviously become bigger bigger percentage overall revenue think look enterprise little bit soft first half maybe talk little bit little bit soft first half whether quadro whether tesla maybe expectation move guess latter part year sure let focus quadro business quadro business product design enterprise workstation probably key part macro condition seen first half year play capital buying cycle lot capital enterprise business relatively steady many year slightly growth position right lot challenge fx rate around world forcing challenge capital purchasing probably slowed business finished siggraph announced couple new graphic card maxwell architecture ph design market second half year pretty excited coming secondly overall tesla business tesla business different business focused data center focused computing well sean vocke colette kress sean vocke colette kressoverall accelerated computing key highlight workload deep learning example overall computing overall channel computing still strong still growing market seeing tremendous growth term deep learning finished fiscal year 2015 year ago 50 growth overall data center business largely due key project deep learning associated internet service provider leveraging gpus train overall application key workload image detection voice recognition video coding also voice translation important workload anything questioning term growth really project spend tremendous excitement still stemming deep learning every day research new workload forming true let dig little bit deeper tesla think 300 million getting close 300 million year think talked ultimately 1 billion business maybe talk key driver get think mentioned deep learning driver get 1 billion mark yes talking installed base data center service several currently accelerated accelerating using gpus next wave workload data center expansion need acceleration overall need data center speed compute complete work future going truly backed overall need acceleration overall tesla gpu leveraged overall performance ease programmability program term cuda development language taught many university 500 different place around world freshly coming university research going business knowing easy program gpus sean vocke colette kress sean vocke colette kress sean vocke q unidentified participantso seeing need speed key workload data center think continue advance fast soon get 1 billion think little hard define next wave speed data center sure maybe ass guess competitive landscape term gpu acceleration vi vi fpga solution even like xeon phi example gpu sit relative fpga term acceleration kind workload really good situation ph space yes always case solve problem multiple way solve acceleration many different form factor fpgas around many different year focusing simplistic type programming may necessary data center get maybe lower power lower performance particularly fpga versus going see gpu also going see environment lot challenge reprogramming fpga data center gpu simplistic term ability change algorithm ﬂy reset overall workload going running software environment friendly type programmer really seen acceleration challenging performing workload data center need overall fpgas yet leverage gpus quite consistently different way solve problem excited coming forward sure think one thing get lost among investment community something guy working many year whereas feel like fpga guy recently guess making push correct think fpgas around quite think recent consolidation put lot attention interesting see market change awareness right question audience right okay let move automotive think sorry one back colette kress sean vocke colette kress sean vockei one virtual reality kind asp think could get guess recommended three different gpus right sort recommending retail asp gpus starting gpu 970 980 980 ti ph overall retail price card chip component retail probably close 300 apiece okay let talk automotive little bit another area guy excited put lot investment time business look last year think 180 million guy talked getting guess going 8 million car 25 million car time maybe talk time see growing 8 million 25 million car tegra business yes last quarter automotive business 80 million quarter term running right grew probably close 80 last quarter nearly almost doubling first half fiscal year 8 million different car road today nvidia technology infotainment center 25 million new car hit road really focusing pipeline design win already completed moving forward timing effect term car hit road work manufacturing cycle ready 25 million car continue work new design win infotainment system move original car several mainstream line find u audi bmws tesla volkswagens golf hondas really kind moving toward broad range different car becomes key main feature selling work forward pipeline continue advanced think driver assist selling overall drive platform announced q2 availability drive platform 50 different oem manufacturer tier one researcher industry take work move overall software algorithm u work together come soon next step term drive sure think talked ada company yesterday called mobileye talking 80 ada market today maybe colette kress sean vocke colette kress sean vocketalk solution different say solution guy like mobileye maybe embedded solution ti say intel freescale yes think another situation everybody approaching opportunity different manner approached looking overall compute platform car one complementary many type provider may able incorporate different type camera sensor type information feeding collective data source taking learning term data center complex data structured coming solution overall ada software algorithm look different competitor look complete computer platform may necessary want function together looking place car manufacturer want single form software able manage software going key differentiating piece provider okay maybe talk little bit many tegras see per vehicle see dollar content growing next year two yes right several car road many four different type processor car front infotainment system well entertainment well move forward key component growth producing value software software algorithm really hoping business model value appreciated overall asp continue grow think business model really building software leveraged across many different type manufacturer produce increased asp may may multiple tegras within auto manufacturer define either way okay question right right let talk model look profitability margin think gross margin 55 operating margin 20 maybe talk margin profitability able expand much last couple year colette kress sean vocke colette kress focus four key market focused platform position really allowed u separate component underneath type oem allowed u establish price point establish business model wanted continue come back produce value understood overall customer think growth platform tesla business grid business enterprise business overall gaming also better company average gross margin really show platform opportunity going forward good top line really pay term gross margin well overall concentration focus operating margin focus leveraged single technology platform maxwell architecture stem way gpu soc leveraging technology engineer working exact technology learning four different market put helpful u manage overall investment portfolio concentrating four finding eﬃciencies need across really also allowed u play growth operating profit net income eps really played strategy going continue focus go forward think important balance think investment market going forward okay icera want touch brieﬂy think obviously made decision exit mobile maybe talk little bit went decision guess decide need technology maybe talk kind impact model going forward mean put take obviously growth vector like enterprise play icera winding yes focused market looked investment modem felt could address need connectivity potentially outside partner necessarily build tough decision important part overall business much discussion need business investment decided best u either wind sell operation ended sean vocke colette kress sean vocke colette kresschoosing wind second quarter still working last couple quarter fiscal year allows u really hone focus area truly drive growth key area deep learning focus also take deep learning automotive key area virtualization well course gaming big part business really focus investment sure look 2017 obviously lot concern licensing business may may roll maybe talk little bit thought licensing business respond concern yes main piece licensing business intel intel take u revenue standpoint first quarter fiscal year 2018 earn revenue associated lot question term get renewed get renewed type piece keep mind really overall umbrella full ip strategy work patent litigation samsung qualcomm itc core currently waiting first part ruling judge first part october likely progress ruling commission end january beginning february think holistic view look overall ip strategy considering licensing revenue part ip strategy think eye itc case next step either side take play sure far legal expense go think took step year maybe talk thought next year litigation expense legal expense yes outlook time fiscal year 2017 fiscal year 2016 increase focus important part business defending ip 7,000 different patent range expense year 70 million 90 million far fiscal year incorporates multiple component offense side itc also structure defense side well go fiscal year 2017 see direction go waiting right court sean vocke q unidentified participant colette kress q unidentified participant colette kress q unidentified participant colette kresssure oh sorry inaudible mean intel part expecting another ip deal focusing samsung qualcomm intel deal perpetual deal ending something hope think think focus ip whole many different player market leverage use overall ip qualcomm samsung case important mobile space mobile architecture monetization ip seen focused believe many different player whether mobile mobile really focused outcome case really discus term licensing think wait see part auto win infotainment basically rendering graphical picture basically purely graphic kind business infotainment system take best benefit gpu putting together something look nearly real material may look real also center entertainment console well putting together way actually visualize overall driving work software content oem manufacturer tier one customize throughout different car put sorry maybe ph understand saying ip legal case come head october march january timeframe go yes hearing took place end june enter first part october first week october expected hear judge ruling likely single judge ruling move commission january/february timeframe also make ruling case sean vocke colette kress sean vocke colette kressbefore finish wanted touch grid business real quick maybe talk effort gpu virtualization large today large think could think look last week think grid 2.0 announced vmworld maybe talk little bit well yes grid position virtualized gpu cloud environment leveraged couple key thing enterprise really enables lot vdi environment one challenge vdi environment user interface user experience want application intensive really challenging created technology market create virtualization capability gpu back data center grid 2.0 announced ability improve overall performance improve concurrency gpu data center essentially doubling depending workload depending experience another key component grid using streaming gaming see lot streaming gaming used gpus used back data center prove grid 2.0 connection vmware vmworld well key component u term software virtualization capability term improving end user experience end fiscal year 2015 reach goal 10 million grid business continuing grow additional use case
