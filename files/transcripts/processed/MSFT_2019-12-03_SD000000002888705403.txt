excellent well good morning everybody welcome back brad zelnick software analyst equity research crãƒâ©dit suisse truly delighted joined rajesh jha microsoft enterprise excuse executive vp see e get confused sometimes executive vp microsoft experience device group format presentation fireside chat think scope microsoft got lot thing talk today maybe introduction sake maybe could start brief bit background rajesh microsoft since early day since 1990 thanks dating brad okay question answer welcome think important recognize perspective time leading experience device includes oï¬ƒce device window client new experience technology enterprise mobility management mean thing touch every day part life give u sense journey year want say year clearly seen lot microsoft time q brad alan zelnick rajesh jhayes sure mean privilege journey came microsoft straight school worked 3 ceo bill steve recently satya experience mostly enterprise side though also worked consumer product would say formative year last 10 perhaps even 15 started vision productivity cloud even though oï¬ƒce 365 journey early member started 10 year ago bill really pushed u think productivity cloud project called mad doc 15 16 year ago interesting technology came take market cloud productivity really mean world cloud last 10 15 year today beyond oï¬ƒce 365 productivity collaboration surface window client management security compliance really thinking modern workplace customer excellent background maybe speak cloud tailwind last 5 year company undergone significant shift proven significant tailwind microsoft whole microsoft really embraced collaborative relationship competitor open source like thing know decade plus ago may never imagined talk group specifically evolved time mean connecting customer sale function way engineering product team great question mean think cloud enabled u really rethink way build product end user perspective go back five year ago application focused used think mail calendar oï¬ƒce collaboration communication today start strong sense user center u live world surrounded device surrounded application working multiple platform started user center notion called microsoft graph encapsulates user goal project work document work device use start core build application whether oï¬ƒce team video stream make work finally enterprise think management security compliance identity knowledge management vision start user center go whereas past really around application silo people ask help user help matter application matter device q brad alan zelnickunderstand context intelligent behalf definitely cloud also helped u much world packaged software used build stuff multiple year hand customer often customer would product would take multiple year deploy feedback signal customer would often year year initially built product get customer build new security capability new knowledge management project cortex talked last month lock/unlock enterprise intellectual property connect people people project skill developing customer product team today take full accountability build stuff ground customer need help customer successful deploying run team called fast track team part oï¬ƒce microsoft 365 team engineer work customer fund help customer get deploy deployment enough work counterpart sale help customer successfully deploy value customer success manager entire life cycle ideation deployment adoption feedback meant changing sale sale force much much business value le licensing sale force increasingly starting think productivity starting think industry relevance partnership front customer going use multiple vendor multiple solution seen u work apple google build application platform course think seen recent announcement salesforce adobe cloud connect make sense rich api microsoft graph allows isvs connect add value customer yes quite journey mean cloud really accelerated rate able deliver value see customer realize value business model delivery model past age quick term development process development team would seem cloud factor served compress development life cycle today thing much iterative much collaborative design iterative process mean different model maybe 5 10 year ago rajesh jha q brad alan zelnick rajesh jha q brad alan zelnick rajesh jha q brad alan zelnick rajesh jha completely agree obviously end benefit customer term run organization think engineering change world way go great question brad mean culturally big transformation innovation long lead cycle end lot functional depth mean product management arm engineering arm consulting arm sale arm support arm discrete life cycle value delivery chain faster pace start compress customer today cloud care issue product issue support delivery issue misconfiguration deployment buying service u force u internally much work work much tighter loop whereas past collaboration different function really core scenario core scenario engineer engineer talk customer far far ever must actually perfectly honest wo way big shock beginning think time make innovation cycle 10x faster every process every process organization completely rethought gone least 10x faster term innovation order magnitude excellent dive product yes sure thing yes course earlier year build conference satya talked microsoft 365 world productivity cloud hearing much microsoft 365 lately vision microsoft 365 really integrated service power modern workplace power modern education power small business nonprofit want bring vision consumer always let talk little bit investment pillar microsoft 365 maybe help concretize first course delivery productivity collaboration service whether oï¬ƒce newer service like microsoft team microsoft stream user work together generate together collaborate together communicate together another investment pillar u take system engagement oï¬ƒce team help people automate business process connect business process take system record connect system engagement lot thrust automation business process connectivity microsoft team power apps enterprise perspective securing complying regulation managing real estate managing data identity kind investment pillar u end day digital transformation picking speed still early day important database organization graph people skill work project connect people relevant business process get context colleague right skill connect relevant project knowledge management another core thrust u microsoft 365 honest 2 three year ago licensing construct allowed customer buy oï¬ƒce 365 management security window 10 one construct instead 3 product 1 licensing construct today integrated product increasingly end user launch edge browser search browser search enterprise knowledge search document search internet search well natural language interface work across data today security perspective signal come endpoint signal come iot signal came application identity integrated longer 3 threat protection story 1 microsoft 365 threat protection integrated admin perspective longer go administer different apps different workload microsoft 365 go admin microsoft.com one way administer microsoft 365 really integrated product service underlies dial tone modern work communication collaboration automation business process connectivity knowledge management course security management q brad alan zelnick rajesh jhanow financially course would expect customer buy vision microsoft 365 tend use service tend higher revenue per user churn le offer customer integration breed also integrated well together sound like tremendous value proposition customer look trend term adopting microsoft 365 would notice industry vertical customer size shared u licensing construct bundle today much integrated maybe tip spear specific demographic driving value prop catalyst adopt yes today know oï¬ƒce 365 lot customer enterprise oï¬ƒce 365 many customer take look service opportunity take management security window 10 commercial integration point customer like goodyear oï¬ƒce 365 customer choosing microsoft 365 customer one path see customer technical diï¬ƒculty microsoft 365 customer today using microsoft 365 one thing may talked enough microsoft 365 oï¬ƒce traditionally information worker people like u microsoft 365 bringing productivity collaboration call worker 2 billion people planet often first touch patient touch somebody retail ï¬‚oor manufacturing work knowledge better knowledge shift process communicate colleague also see customer broadening coverage microsoft 365 beyond information worker example air france using worker transportation industry mark spencer using microsoft 365 get retail employee connected information worker connected use microsoft team configurable app brings module together mean go another path see oï¬ƒce microsoft 365 see broadening coverage employee covered microsoft 365 still customer continue move healthy clip cloud directly microsoft 365 older version oï¬ƒce window q brad alan zelnick rajesh jhawe excited microsoft 365 beyond enterprise smb value proposition give integrated security integrated collaboration productivity compelling traditionally oï¬ƒce much share emerging market excited microsoft 365 emerging market microsoft 365 great set application mobile device economy get microsoft 365 extending well talked innovation driving integrated solution already note ask driving combined value proposition one topic mean written ai microsoft graph ask edge computing maybe talk part overall design construct guy thinking edge relates overall proposition offering yes sure mean first let talk ai part like go back saying longer application able compute deliver ai centered calendar task project document different application manifest differently example word health care industry spellcheck grammar check critique know vocabulary know acronym know project name organization based purpose graph giving ai contextual job industry specific company today take look powerpoint ability recommend many deck create much presentation create often original idea want take idea relevant deck want bring together ai help suggests `` hi see slide working recommend document purpose access may relevant take slide measure success ai based many idea gave user many time choose keep idea relentlessly get better better microsoft team example meeting automatic transcription translation satya townhall ai able split video chunk somebody searching given topic get video get specific snippet relevant search term talked security compliance think unique value proposition security compliance one pillar fact 6.5 trillion 7 trillion signal coming every single day graph ai actually really trying think threat protection signal ai permeates q brad alan zelnick rajesh jha q brad alan zelnick rajesh jha q brad alan zelnickin project cortex knowledge management applying ai signal got permeates everything point brad edge edge computing think architected way azure cloud m365 run compute client necessary model run client disconnect run service make sense overlay enterprise model top personal model oï¬ƒce oï¬ƒce ability served cloud directly browser also run native application whether window pc mac io android device take compute right ever get got dig oï¬ƒce 365 commercial point material portion total oï¬ƒce commercial installed base 65 end fiscal seat growth still strong 21 least recent quarter think installed base o365 commercial going forward focus migrating still versus adding new seat balance 2 growth driver yes think balance much talked seat growth seat growth continues come feel growth opportunity term going beyond information worker existing customer information worker connecting worker connecting worker information worker business process driver future growth seat existing customer small business think opportunity reach share small business lot room grow talked emerging market ability productivity collaboration experience mobile device see another growth opportunity term customer still moving cloud continue security compliance feature continue add seen recently bank canada moved recent example couple capability looking available cloud rajesh jhagot switch topic cybersecurity recently hearing much security microsoft obviously huge area opportunity large expanding market fact last earnings call satya talked sentinel microsoft defender threat protection 100,000 organization using azure ad premium recall hearing microsoft spends 1 billion year r context 2x significant security company like palo alto network amazing microsoft think security today across competitive landscape yes good question brad let start telling see customer context today first feel today talking customer prior meeting telling 150 security solution atypical many solution make secure 150 different application telling incident alert threat mean going stitch together one important really look fragmentation signal fragmentation different lens make secure even need continues grow intellectual property creation really happening digital transformation whether code data whether document whether business process need protected fragmented protected today think one statistic remember 80 content exists organization today even classified even know risk profile thing early day transformation thing see rate change incredibly fast right organization still early day traditional perimeter disappearing network perimeter people bring device iot proliferation data generation code generation organization continues grow take look talent available customer actually reason signal drive security huge shortage people security incident management kind analysis vision security would say first want make sure build breed category whether endpoint management whether stem whether identity want core category also want deeply integrated go back fragmentation enough want integrated second thing want build security close data close application want also extend fact heterogeneity customer q brad alan zelnick rajesh jha q brad alan zelnick rajesh jhaenvironment example data leakage protection built core workï¬‚ows oï¬ƒce allow connector bring data apply policy data leakage protection thing threat protection extensible third thing feel like saying earlier 6.5 trillion signal every single day identity endpoint application run ai connector customer bring signal graph reason finally going solve customer going multiple solution something called intelligent security graph allow customer plug signal others isvs 50 partner today enter security graph taking holistic look security would say security one dimension security compliance compliance mean privacy mean insider threat risk management 80 big breach tend insider risk insider threat rather outside classify data protect overlay right policy security compliance course identity core plane enables thing finally management security integrate get signal security security signal tell exposure across vast range device enterprise management plane able take signal remediate thing expansive view rajesh half hour go pretty quickly interesting conversation want sneak 1 2 quick topic minute left yes term team team seen significant success deep integration oï¬ƒce product larger daily active usage term compared main competitor end game collaboration important maybe 10 year ago atomic unit productivity individual could go true anymore atomic unit product right group none u anything meaningful context working others microsoft team vision team like meta operating q brad alan zelnick rajesh jhasystem fish something centered group application come group right application come group today way compute whether phone tablet desktop pick application trying get job done collaborate within application jump application application team vision go group trying project whether group org group whether project group right application come group team think shell brings chat brings meeting brings telephony brings oï¬ƒce brings application brings business process take look ui team extend like metaphor bring external application right application right group also carry mobile device mobile device today configure module say worker mark spencer perhaps application show team shell team shell chat scheduling module module take look task list need see meeting module team like shell brings productivity oriented group vision team applicable information worker worker productivity also connecting business process committed making team powerful platform allows application connect connected oï¬ƒce team helpful perspective little bit time left financial analyst end day least wanted ask question margin oï¬ƒce 365 margin particular heard talk o365 margin moving towards steady state moderating improvement business hit gross margin percentage journey talk difference margin structure serve o365 versus typical cloud saas offering first say o365 saas offering couple thought first take look scale o365 think last quarter amy satya talked u 200 million active user take 200 million active user service many user find sliver even service 200 million pick service 2 million user margin profile going different margin profile something like mail document storage real cost storage o365 m365 broad set service across many user think compare saas service couple million user aggregate usage pattern q brad alan zelnick rajesh jha q brad alan zelnick rajesh jhawith feel feel hard work engineering side azure colleague continue drive cog increase margin counter pressure customer using workload ai investment ready make investment give value back customer know e5 premium offering customer security compliance phone system going continue add new value analytics knowledge management project cortex increase arpu give u higher margin lot thing play workload different cog profile others continue engineering work ai consumption counter pressure premium offering continue increase margin make perfect sense think time rajesh thank immensely joining u year conference pleasure thank great yes thank brad thanks
