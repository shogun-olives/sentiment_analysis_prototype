Good morning. And thank you for calling Costco Wholesale Corporation. I'm David
Sherwood, Director of Finance and Investor Relations. And this morning I will review
with you our sales results for the four-week retail month of July, which started on
Monday, July 8 and ended on Sunday, August 4. For comparable sales results, this
four-week period is compared to the same four-week period last year, specifically
Monday, July 9 through Sunday, August 5. July included 28 selling days for both
years.

These risks and uncertainties include. But are not limited to, domestic and
international economic conditions including exchange rates; the effects of

subsequent events or circumstances.
Now with regard to sales, as reported in today's press release, net sales for the
month of July came in at $7.87 billion for the four weeks ended August 4, up 7%
compared to the $7.36 billion reported for the same period last year. Net sales for
the 48 weeks ended August 4 came in at $94.91 billion this year, up 8% compared to
the $87.72 billion for the same period last year.
Comparable sales results for the four-week July retail month and the 48-week fiscal
year-to-date reporting periods were as follows. In the US the four weeks was a plus
4%, 48 weeks plus 6%; International the four weeks was a plus 4%, 48 weeks plus
6%; total Company plus 4% for the four weeks, plus 6% for 48 weeks.
For the four-week period, changes in gasoline prices had a positive impact, while
foreign exchange rates had a negative impact on comparable sales. These impacts
were immaterial for the 48-week period.
Excluding these effects, comparable sales were as follows. In the US the four weeks
is a plus 3%, 48 weeks plus 6%; International the four weeks plus 8%, 48 weeks plus
6%; and total Company for the four weeks plus 5% and for the 48 weeks plus 6%.
In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights for the
month of July were as follows.
On a regional and country basis, US regions with the strongest results were
Southeast, Texas and Midwest. On an international basis, in local currencies, we saw
the strongest results in Canada, Japan and Mexico.
As far as merchandise highlights, the following comparable sales results, by category
exclude the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Foods and Sundries comparable sales for the month were in the low to mid single-
digit range. Within Food and Sundries, the departments with the strongest results
were Cooler, Liquor, Frozen Foods and Candy. We experienced a slight amount of
inﬂation during July in Foods and Sundries compared to last year.
Comp sales results for Hardlines were down slightly for the month. Better performing
departments were Lawn and Garden, Automotive and Oﬃce Supplies. Electronics
was negative for the month with softer sales in TVs, Cameras and Computers.
Softlines experienced positive comp sales results in the low double-digit range.
Better performing departments within Softlines included Domestics, Housewares
and Apparel.
Fresh Foods experienced positive comp sales results in the mid single-digit range for
the month. Service Deli and Produce experienced the strongest results. Fresh Foods
experienced slight pricing inﬂation for the month compared to last year.
Within the Ancillary businesses, Hearing Aids, Gasoline and Optical produced the
best comp sales increases. Gasoline comp sales were up low single digit year over
year. The average selling price per gallon was 6% higher at $3.68 this year,
compared to $3.48 last year. Overall, gasoline price inﬂation had a positive impact of
about 0.75% up on July comp sales. Comp gallons were also up year over year.
Weakening foreign currencies year over year relative to the US dollar resulted in a
detriment to our reported July comp sales of a little less than 1%.
Total international comps for the four-week period came in at plus 8% in local
currencies. But resulted in a reported comp of plus 4% when converted to the US
dollar.
The average transaction was ﬂat year over year including the overall slight net
negative impact from foreign exchange and gasoline price inﬂation. Comparable
traﬃc frequency was up just over 4%.
Cannibalization for the month of July had a negative impact to total Company's
comparable sales of a little over minus 0.5% in line with recent trends.
Looking ahead, August sales will include 28 selling days for both years. The
reporting period will end on Sunday, September 1 and will be compared to the four
weeks ended Sunday, September 2 last year. We plan to announce August sales on
Thursday, September 5, 2013.
