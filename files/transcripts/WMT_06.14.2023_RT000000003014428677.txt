Good morning, everyone. I'm Greg Melich. I cover the retail Broadlines & Hardlines
here at Evercore ISI. It's my pleasure to have with us today, John David Rainey, the
Chief Financial Oﬃcer of Walmart, an exciting almost first year under his belt.
And John David, it's a pleasure to have you with us. Thanks for coming, and I'll have
you introduce the team.

Yes. Greg, thanks for hosting us. It's a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak with
this audience. With me today, I've also got Kary and Steph, and so they'll join me in
answering some of your questions. We're really looking forward to it.
Questions And Answers

(Question And Answer)
That's great. So, I'll kick right off on a strategic update. Walmart has undergone a lot
of portfolio shifts in terms of international businesses and even different capabilities
that they bought or gotten rid of divested. I'd just love an update now on where we
are in terms of the portfolio of the business both geographically and by function.

Sure. Happy to do that. International has gotten a little more focus since we talked
about it at our Investor Day a couple of months ago and for good reason. It's an area
of a lot of excitement. India gets a lot of attention with what's happening there withQ - Greg Melich
A - John David RaineyFlipkart and PhonePe. It's not crazy, Greg, to think that both those businesses could
be $100 billion businesses in the future, and so it's quite exciting there.
But our international portfolio is much more than that, when you think about the rest
of our footprint. And I would say, we're pretty comfortable with where we are right
now. There's not necessarily a region of the world, where we think that we need to
be where we're not. And so, I think the international portfolio is probably pretty
stable at the moment.
We get asked a lot of questions about this, particularly when people try to derive the
return on invested capital for this portfolio. But there's a couple of things that are
probably worth noting. It's a little into the weeds, but if you'll indulge me on this. But
with respect to some of our investments internationally, like JD.com and some of
these others, if you think about the equation of return on invested capital and our
accounting for that, we actually have nothing in the numerator, but a number in the
denominator, because that is just mark-to-market at each period.
By the same token, acquisitions that we made in the past, like Asda, when because
we segment report at an international level, we still carry the goodwill from that,
even though we no longer have that entity. And so, our return on capital in the
international entity is actually quite a bit higher than what one can surmise by
looking from the outside in. And so, we talked at our Investor Day about this plan
that we have over the next several years of growing operating income faster than
sales.
Well, international is a big component of that. In fact, we expect both on a sales basis
as well as operating income basis, the international portfolio to do better than the
rest of the enterprise.

Interesting. And I guess maybe a same question then in regards to the mix of the
business. You've talked about the ﬂywheel and those, whether it's an advertising
business or 3P marketplace. Could you help us sort of level set, where we are now in
terms of that and getting those back to profitability and driving increased returns?

Yes, happy to. In the U.S., I feel like we're beginning to hit our stride in some of these
initiatives that go beyond retail. Things like advertising, things like fulfillment
services, data ventures. And depending upon what region of the world, we have
advanced at different paces. So, if you just think of e-commerce broadly, in China,
roughly half of our business is e-commerce. And so, there's a good balance between
brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. India, obviously, is almost entirely a digital
business.
But when you think of areas like Canada or Mexico or Chile, those are areas that I
think we can continue to build out some of these -- this other suite of services that
include the things that I mentioned around these digital services, like advertising,Q - Greg Melich
A - John David Rainey
Q - Greg Melich
A - John David Rainey
Q - Greg Melichfulfillment services. We've made great progress with what we're doing in Mexico, but
I think we've got more to go. And so, it's more of a continuation of what we talked
about in the U.S. with different levels of advancement.

Got it. So, maybe then bringing it back home a little bit, where are we? What's the
bigger opportunity? Is it in marketplace, is it in fulfillment, is it in media, if you look at
these, the new businesses domestically?

Well, they're all interdependent and we won't be able to do any one of them in
isolation without being really good at the others. So, I think, it starts with the value
proposition that we provide around convenience and what that does for our
customers, as we move more into the channels that are responding to the ways in
which they want to shop. It gives us the opportunity to go in and advertise to them or
for a third-party seller fulfill their -- the sale of that item and delivered it to our
customers. They're all very large opportunities.
Advertising is probably the one that gets the most focus. And so, I don't want to talk
about that at the expense of the others, but certainly it's a big opportunity. When you
look at what some of our competitors are doing in terms of their advertising dollars
relative to their GMV and then you look at Walmart, you would argue that we're way
underpenetrated. But I think the important thing for us, if you think about any digital
business, the challenge is scale and scaling those opportunities out. Well, we're
starting today with scale. We've got hundreds of millions of customers that come to
Walmart each week and so, if we can leverage that with these digital opportunities, it
gives us a real advantage.

Are there any other capabilities that you need or we sort of piloted and tested the
capabilities, so that now you can scale the back-end, whether it be from innovation,
logistics, et cetera?

At a macro level, I don't feel like there's anything that we're missing. At a micro level,
I think we can get a lot better at some of these capabilities, understanding our
customers, understanding what creates great buying experiences for them, where
they want to come back with frequency and shop with us in multiple channels. And
so, this is part of building that muscle. We are less advanced in some of the leading
companies in the space and so that's what we're doing right now. But that's what
excites me about the opportunity that we have in front of us.

Maybe to pivot a little bit and we walked around the world. We got to the U.S.
strategic Sam's Club. It's a business that few years ago, we were closing clubs. Now,A - John David Rainey
Q - Greg Melich
A - John David Raineywe're going to start to open clubs. I guess what changed here. Is it inherently lower
margin than Walmart U.S. or not? And help us figure it out.

The nature of Sam's and the way that we price for our customers, it is a lower margin
business. But if you look at the last three years setting aside the last quarter, we've
had tremendous growth, double-digit comp growth over the last three years, 12
consecutive quarters. And we're always looking at where we can change our
portfolio, but whether it's adding to it or removing from in some cases.
And in the case of Sam's, we identify some good opportunities, where there's a
good market fit and a market need. And it gives us the conviction to go out and add
30 stores over the next several years. Sam's in many ways is, and honestly, I think
sometimes gets overshadowed from this larger U.S. segment, but there's a ton of
exciting things to talk about in Sam's. In particular, what we're doing with the digital
engagement of those customers. And one of the things I love to talk about is the
Scan and Pay or Scan and Go, where someone can use a mobile device to shop in
store, then seamlessly check out and not have to wait in line. What's interesting
about that, Greg, is roughly one in four of our transactions is done that way.
And if you step back and you think about that for a second, that's a digital
experience in a brick and mortar world, right? There are a few experiences or few
other companies I can probably point to that level of penetration in that type of
experience. And so, I think, it's really a great example of where we're advancing and
where we're following the customer to make sure that we're providing the type of
experience that they want.

We actually had Frank Blake at the conference earlier today, and he was talking
about that the data the retailers have and how that's so critical, and the ability to use
it to drive customer satisfaction. So, maybe to pivot to a little bit more the business
today and the top-line drivers, I would say Walmart's traﬃc, we've seen accelerate to
3% or better with the comps running north of 5%. Could you help us understand
what categories are driving that and some of the consumer makeup within that,
that's driving that growth?

Sure. Well, we're mostly benefiting from higher growth in grocery right now, food
and consumables. And as customers' wallets are being pinched, you certainly see
them have more discretion with some of these larger ticket items. And they're
looking for value, value and convenience. And so we've seen share gains, most
notably in grocery. And when you think about the income demographics that we're
seeing that in, it's pretty dispersed across the three income tiers that we follow.
Earlier, in the -- going back last year, when we were seeing higher inﬂation, it was
more skewed to the higher income groups. But I think more recently, it's been more
evenly dispersed among all the income groups. But an important thing here, Greg, isQ - Greg Melich
A - John David Rainey
Q - Greg Melich
A - John David Raineythat this is not just about value. This is also about convenience. And as we continue
to see robust growth in things like delivery from store or people buying something
online and picking it up in store, we're providing convenience to customers.
And I think very importantly, if you contrast that to a lot of other trends that we saw
throughout the pandemic, some of those trends for good reason, like went up
during the pandemic, but then reverted back to trend line. This is an area of our
business and specifically what I'm talking about is the grocery delivery or buying
online and picking up store or picking it up in store. It's continued to go up into the
right throughout the pandemic and then after it.
So, one of the things we look at is the weekly average customer count of our
customers. And in the last quarter, we talked about that being 40% up year-over-
year. Well, it's been that way for several quarters. If you go back four years ago, this
has been a consistent trend up into the right and so I think it really shows that, this
isn't much about convenience, is it is about value.

Interesting. So, maybe to follow up on the value side of that and we'll get to
convenience. How would you frame your price gaps today versus 12 months ago or
for pre-COVID versus the competition?

We're comfortable with our price gaps today. And I think that's been the case for the
last three, maybe four quarters. And certainly, if you go back multiple years ago, I
think, there was a recognition that we needed to invest in that area. We needed to
invest in our pricing. We've done that, but we operate in a dynamic competitive
environment. So, we're going to continue to do, what's best for our customers, do
what's best for Walmart. So, that may take changes from time to time, but we don't
see a period or a step change investment in this area. So, it's something that we look
at every Monday morning. We have a meeting, where we're monitoring our prices
versus the competition. And as we stand here today, we feel comfortable with where
we are.

Got it. And we had the Mission Impossible theme at the Shareholders Day. Maybe
you follow up a little bit on that. What can Walmart do to help reduce inﬂation? And
where are we with rollbacks and how -- what can that go to historically in terms of the
number across the store and categories?

Yes, I'll start here. Maybe, Steph, you might want to jump in on the rollback piece.
But we're working, we recognize, first of all, like the headline inﬂation numbers are
coming down because we're lapping higher prices year-over-year, but prices are still
high. If you're a consumer and you're going to fill up a basket with groceries of food,
it's still roughly 20% higher than it was two years ago.A - Stephanie Schiller Wissink
Q - Greg Melich
A - Stephanie Schiller Wissink
Q - Greg MelichOur mission is to provide the very best pricing for our customers that we can. So, we
work with our suppliers to try to make that happen. But we also -- we've got a big
private brand business with Walmart U.S., roughly 20%, a little bit ahead of that,
greater than 20% of our sales are in private brand items. And Sam's, it's closer to
30%. So, this is a good vehicle to be able to provide value to our customers.
Steph, do you want to talk a little bit about, what we're doing on rollbacks?

Yes. I think John David's point that we're working very closely with our suppliers and
our vendors, particularly in dry grocery, but across the overall grocery and
consumables basket, to be very directed about how we use rollback dollars. And
we're concentrating those around major events, where we know the consumer is
looking to us to fight inﬂation even harder for them.
And if you recall even last fall, we started this campaign, where we would effectively
digest inﬂation for the consumer. So, Thanksgiving meal at last year's price or a
holiday basket at last year's value, we carried that all the way through our spring
marketing campaign and it's proven to be really effective for us, not only in driving
customer engagement, but also reinforcing our position.
And I think we're gaining some goodwill among consumers right now, in addition to
overall working very closely with our suppliers to make sure that their dollars are the
most effective for them to drive the volume they need as well.
So, it's a continuation of what we've been doing and what's been working, but you're
going to see more of that, as we get into the back half of the year. Back to school is a
really important point for us to reinforce that value proposition, and then you'll see
that continue into the fall and holiday season.

Just to maybe frame a little bit, I think, I heard the number a few weeks ago, when I
was out there that we have hundreds of rollbacks now. I think they're typically what
90 days and then. But in the past, I remember there being thousands of Walmart
rollbacks at other periods of time. Is that the kind of magnitude that could increase
over the next few months?

Yes. I think what John Furner said last -- a couple weeks ago at our shareholders
event is that you could see a doubling into the back half, but I don't know that I
would put a 10x multiplier on it.

Okay. So, that's definitely the direction I guess. Maybe to pivot a little bit, John David,
you mentioned before its value, but it's also convenience, right. I thought one of the
things we saw recently was that the pickup 2.0, also with delivery, which youA - John David Rainey
Q - Greg Melich
A - John David Raineymentioned, and just follow up with more on where you're really getting traction with
those initiatives.

Yes. Well, a lot of what we're doing there is also automating that supply chain,
whether it's the automated storage and retrieval in our fulfillment centers or what
we're doing in our stores and these micro fulfillment centers that's making it a lot
more eﬃcient for us. And enabling us to better serve our customers, reduce wait
times, have more accuracy in terms of the items that we're picking for that basket,
because we're continuing to see consumer behavior shift in that direction, where
they recognize that, it is a very convenient process.
But moreover, I think, if you are a consumer probably like I was, and prior to the
pandemic, you probably didn't think about online grocery or grocery delivery,
because you were concerned about the quality of the goods that you were going to
get, whether it was the wilted lettuce or the hard avocados, you want to make sure
that you have the ability to do that. As customers go through that experience and
they have a very good experience, they're much more likely to come back.
And what's important for us is, we think about the expansion of the portfolio of
products that we sell, customers get used to doing that, then they're more likely to
add that general merchandise item that they can throw into that basket, have it
delivered at their house or pick it up at the store. And so, convenience is a really
important part of where we're going here. I think importantly, when we look at or we
survey the mindshare scores from our consumers, we're rated right now for
convenience almost as high as value. We've never been there historically. And so, I
think it suggests, Greg, that what we're doing is working and it's resonating with
customers. And we want to continue to do that going forward.

And could you remind us the number of stores that are getting the remodel this year
to and I'll throw out the 20% number, I think we heard in some New Jersey stores,
but feel free to dial that back if you want and update us on the store rollout.

We're really excited about a lot of these remodels that we're doing. What is the total
number that we have; 300. But the number that Greg's referring to is during our
Associates Week, it was disclosed that some of these stores are seeing an uplift in
sales as much as 20% after we've remodeled them. And you have to experience this
for yourself. It really is -- it's a different Walmart, when you go to it with improved
waypoint finding, signage, wider aisles, displays around apparel. And it really has a
different look and feel as well as additional brands that we haven't traditionally
carried. And so, we're quite excited about it.
But to the 20% number, one would expect and we've seen this historically, when you
have a remodel, you're going to get a little bit of an uplift in sales and sometimes
that abates over time as that newness wears-off. The uplift that we've seen aroundQ - Greg Melich
A - John David Rainey
A - Stephanie Schiller Wissinkthis is much, much higher than what we traditionally see. We would again expect it to
decline over time. I don't expect any of us believe that we're going to have a 20%
uplift in sales in perpetuity. But even if it's a fraction of that, this is a highly accretive
ROI initiative for us. And so we're quite excited about it. We're pretty early on into
this as well. I don't want to overstate this. We've only done a few stores, but the early
returns are quite exciting.

Yes. Another, I won't call it the last, it's certainly not least top-line drivers, Walmart+.
You talked about delivery. I'd love to -- where does that fit in the realm of things
you're doing to build that loyalty and traﬃc, particularly with a new customer? I
mean, our survey work suggests you got around 12 million members and when we
back out some of your numbers, feel free to update that or critique it. But
fundamentally, where are we on Walmart+?

Yes. So, I think Walmart+, we're in the beginning stages of this, quite excited. And
what's really interesting to me about this, Greg, is the group of customers that we
see this as, it's a more -- it's a younger, tends to be a little more ﬂuent, more tech
savvy customer that again really values convenience. And if you think going back to
this convenience notion, that matters to people irrespective of your income level.
And when you look at like grocery pickup as an example, roughly 50% of our
Walmart+ members come through that channel or grocery delivery. And so, it's
someone that really values the utility of that membership and what it can provide.
But I think very importantly for us, it allows us to have more digital engagement with
that customer. So, we better understand them and can tailor our offerings that are
most relevant to them versus trying to guess and pick and choose certain things that
are really based upon more macro level customer stats.
And so, we want to continue to do this, we want to continue to provide value and
utility. I think importantly, we need to get better at some of the things that we
provide here. Like even if you think about one-day delivery or two-day delivery, or in
some cases, we may have to cancel an order, like we have room for improvement
there. But these are all things that we're working on and making great progress.

Greg, let me just add to that, just as a follow-up from our associate event. One of the
things we're doing uniquely with Walmart+ is, we're co-creating this experience with
our customer. So, there's a very strong feedback loop embedded in the
development of Walmart+ as a platform. John David's spot on. The value equation is
very clear from an economic perspective. The conveniences are increasingly
becoming clear. But even going into desirability and help me live better, the other
side of our mission, right, save money and live better. So, you're seeing value added
to the Walmart+ platform based on the feedback loop we're getting from our
customers going out to the market and finding things that help them live better and
making that available as part of their overall plus experience.A - John David Rainey
Q - Greg Melich
A - John David Rainey
Q - Greg Melich
A - John David Rainey
Q - Greg Melich
A - John David Rainey
Looking at the CLV or the customer lifetime value of a Walmart+ member, it is
appreciably higher than someone that doesn't engage with us this way or is not
availing themselves of that membership. They tend to have -- they spend more with
this and they tend to shop more frequently. And so, it's something clearly, we want to
have more of our customers take advantage of, because of the benefits that we see
to Walmart.

Is the lift 50% or does it double? Any --

I'm not disclosing the number.

Okay.

But I do someway describe it as appreciably higher. We're not talking $10 or $50. It's
much higher with that customer.

Got it. Well, maybe, I think, in our last 10, 15 minutes, I want to get to some of the fun
stuff like margins. It's great to drive the top-line in the traﬃc, but it's also good to
make more money doing it. So, could you just get in some of the drivers of the
margin expansion that you've talked about that you can get back to the goal of
growing EBIT faster than sales?

The margin expansion that we talked about and we really, I think, drilled in on this at
our Investor Day, where we talked about growing margin much faster than sales, it's
a result of a number of things. But fundamentally, the mix of our business is
changing.
If you think about a 4% or 5% margin retail business, which is growing at a low
single-digit rate and then you combine that with these faster growing elements of
our business like advertising, like fulfillment services, like data ventures. And I'm not
even talking about like what's going on with Flipkart and PhonePe and some of
these other entities. These are all things that are improving their margins and have
higher margins at a much greater rate and growing faster. So, the pure mix of our
business is changing. So, that's one element of that.
The second piece of this is moving more into GM. By moving into e-commerce
channels and having a marketplace and third-party sellers, it allows us to provideQ - Greg Melich
A - John David Rainey
A - Stephanie Schiller Wissinkassortment of merchandise that we haven't historically to customers. And we see that
the customers that are coming there are buying more GM. And so that tends to carry
a higher margin in some of our food and grocery.
The third area, Greg, really relates to the pure unit economics of what we control in
delivering these services and goods to customers. And supply chain is, I think, the
best example to point to right there. We're making a tremendous investment in our
supply chain. You've got the opportunity to see some of this. You mentioned that.
But the unit economics around fulfillment will improve by roughly 20%. It will be 20%
lower, rather, I should say, in five years, when we complete this.
And in the next five years or three years, I think it is, we're going to have roughly 65%
of our stores that are served by automation. And so, this provides a better
experience, more integrity to the experience with our customers, also lowers our unit
costs. And so, it's expanding more into GM, it's having these other businesses grow
faster, and then improving the unit economics of the services that we provide today.

So, if I was thinking about a unit economics standpoint over that three, four, five
years, should I be thinking about supply chain costs coming down 20% if they were
5% of sales, that could be 100 bps of margin? Or can I include some of the store
costs as well to maybe even have it be more than 100 bps opportunity? Am I framing
that right?

The opportunity is in excess of 100 bps, but you're thinking about absolutely the
right way. And it applies to both our FCs and DCs, but also the stores themselves.
We focus a lot on supply chain technology, but we're implementing technology like
our VisBic system back in electronic shelf labels.
So, electronic shelf labels save a ton of hours in a store over the course of a period,
like a quarter, because you're not needing to go in and change all of those manually.
And all of this, all of this automation really gives us an opportunity to operate much
more eﬃciently and allow our associates to do what they do best, and that's serve
our customer.

And Greg, maybe just to finalize that point on associates, our expectation is that our
population of associates would remain relatively ﬂat over the next several years. So,
we don't expect to see a drawdown in the number of people, but it's redeploying
each individual person to do different jobs and upskilling a good majority of our
workforce into places that they're serving the customer or more close in proximity to
the customer or doing things within the automation sequence, where they're serving
and contributing to the overall technology. So, that a real good opportunity for our
associates as well and not expecting to have major changes in our overall
headcount.Q - Greg Melich
A - John David Rainey
Q - Greg Melich
A - John David Rainey
Q - Greg Melich
Hold on and I --

Go ahead. I'm sorry, Greg.

I guess what I would say is the trend, my next question is going to be basically that,
which is that, you've invested a lot in labor over the last few years. I think wages have
been up probably low double digits a few years ago and probably up mid-singles
this year. Is that moderates back to something more normal, the way here is really to
get more productivity out of the labor, is that what I'm--?

That's true. And to restate what Steph said slightly differently, we believe we can
grow into this. And our labor, we feel comfortable with where we are today, whether
it's our average wage or our starting wage. And the wages for our associates have
increased tremendously over whether you look at a three-year period or five-year
period.
And so, we definitely want to continue to pay our associates appropriately, but it's
not just about an average hourly wage. It's all -- we view this as careers, like if you
just take a stat like promotions, 88% of the promotions or positions, I should say that
have been filled at the store above a start or an entry-level have been filled by
people that are Walmart associates. So, we're not going out and hiring someone off
the street necessarily. We're giving someone the opportunity to advance. And so
that's -- I think that's really important, as people think about their own wealth
creation and career growth at Walmart.
But I want to go back to this point that you mentioned around margin, because what
we said at Investor Day is that, we expect over the next several years that on average
sales will grow about 4%. Some years it may be more, some years it may be less, but
on average about 4%. And we said that operating income should grow faster than
that. But very clearly, like I'm not talking about like 5%. If all we do is 5%, I'll be
disappointed. And so we showed this range of outcomes, I think, kind of cleverly in a
shaded graph here, but upwards of almost 8%.
And so, we think there's a tremendous opportunity if we execute on the initiatives
that we control to dramatically change the margin profile of our company. And what
that really translates into is increased free cash ﬂow, better profits, and then you get
into capital allocation, and so it's a big opportunity for Walmart going forward.

That's a great way to tie it together. I do -- I want to make sure that we didn't leave
out those, that business mix part that you talked about at the beginning. What is aA - John David Rainey
Q - Greg Melich
A - John David Rainey
Q - Greg Melich
A - John David Raineyreasonable goal for things like the media business? Do I look at it as a percentage of
sales -- of digital sales? Or how do we even frame what the opportunity is there?

The way that we look at it internally, and I think the external metrics around this as
well, is looking at it as a percent of GMV, but we call it roughly sales today. And if you
look at what some of our competitors do or maybe what best-in-class is, that
approach is 10% for some people. But that's also dependent, Greg, upon the types
of items that you're selling. So, you'll see more advertising as it relates to GM than
you will food. You are going to, it's easier to attract the advertising dollars for a pair
of sneakers than it is a head of Broccoli.
And so, if you were to take that 9% or 10%, which is kind of the high watermark in the
industry for people like us, and normalize that for our mix of business, that actually
translates into call it roughly 6 and being using a little bit crude math here, but
roughly 6%, 7% GMV. And so, that's an aspiration for us. If we did that, that would put
us in the top 10 probably advertisers in the U.S. in the next five years. And so, it's a
big opportunity.

Is there an opportunity beyond just product sales and vendors that you might
already be working with? And maybe other, I'm just thinking examples like would
Marriott Hotels want to advertise with you knowing that somebody has been looking
at luggage?

Yes, absolutely. But I -- and I think that's a not insignificant opportunity at all. But I
think very importantly, we want to make sure that we advertise in a way that provides
a better experience for our customers. We don't want to over-rotate here and just try
to monetize advertising dollars and throw a bunch of stuff and offers in front of our
customers that aren't relevant to them.
And so, we're always going to keep our focus and our eye on our mission, which is
helping our customers, save money and live better. And so, we're going to be
probably a little more -- use a little more discretion in certain areas around
advertising. But in your example, if that's relevant to that customer, we believe that
that's something that we want -- that they would want, we would absolutely consider
something like that.

Got it. So, you don't want to go crazy, whether it's a slippery slope, but if it's
targeted, it makes sense.

Exactly.Q - Greg Melich
A - John David Rainey
Q - Greg Melich
A - John David Rainey
Great. So, maybe in the last few minutes, got to get -- we did margins, I want to make
sure we get to returns and balance sheet and cash ﬂow and all that good stuff. So,
CapEx is going up. I think you guys have mentioned maybe close to $20 billion, no
matter how you framed it. When do we get that ROI inﬂection?

Yes. So, let me start with the way that we view capital allocation is every dollar has to
compete for all the alternatives that are out there. And right now, we believe the
single best investment is investing in ourselves in some of the CapEx, because of the
high ROI around that. And what we've stated there is despite a more elevated level
of CapEx, we believe that our ROI can go up every year. And to me, that's a good
governor or guardrail to make sure that we're not telling the investment community,
we promise or just wait, we're going to spend all this money and this will come
several years later.
We want to demonstrate that we can invest in our business, while seeing our return
on investment go up each year. It'll go up a little bit this year. It's going to go up a
little bit more than that the year after that, more the year after that based upon the
trajectory of the investment that we're making.
But that said, we believe it's important to be balanced in capital allocation and that
includes returning cash to shareholders through the form of share repurchases and
dividends. And we're going to be aggressive, where it's appropriate. If we think our
stock is undervalued, you'll see us be more opportunistic. But we believe that it's
always appropriate to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases.
When we look at our multi-year plan, our five-year plan and the economics around
that, that should drive share gains much greater than what we see today. And so,
we're investing for the long term here. We're thinking about this in the same way that
any investor would.
We also would aspire to continue to increase our dividend. We are a dividend
aristocrat. We've been increasing our dividend for a number of years. And at some
point in the future, we'd be able to maybe hope to have a step change, where we
increase it even more to perhaps have a higher payout ratio than what we do today.
But I think it's important that we demonstrate that, that comes with increasing
margins, increasing free cash ﬂow before we do that.

And when you -- you talk about payout ratios, is at a percentage of prior year
earnings or how would you think about it?

Q - Greg Melich
A - John David RaineyPrior year earnings, and if you look historically, go back, 8 or 10 years, that's
vacillated or been in a range of call it mid-30s to mid-40s. And that's probably
what's been appropriate for our business at that period of time. We don't really have
a targeted payout ratio as a policy, I should say. We have something we targeted
internally, but we don't have a policy around that. But this is an opportunity for us in
the future. If we want to change that and be -- send a little different message to the
street around how we're thinking about that dividend.

And maybe the last part of that question is the, what's the optimal leverage ratio? I
mean obviously a lot of changes in rates, you own a lot of your real estate, fortress
balance sheet, but is there a number of debt-to-EBITDA that you target or, yes?

Yes. We generally target a 2x leverage ratio, AA credit rating that provides us the
most ﬂexibility, whether with respect to using that capital, also considering things like
commercial paper. But I think importantly for us, like, we have a tremendous amount
of opportunities, when we think about capital allocation. And we're always going to
be looking at this through the lens of what creates the most value for shareholders.
If you look at our leverage ratio today and you were to map out or graph out like,
where you get to the lowest weighted average cost of capital, it would suggest that
we could lower it marginally, but we lose some ﬂexibility by doing that. And so, we
really like where we are with roughly a 2x leverage ratio and AA credit rating.

It makes a lot of sense. And I think our time has come on to a close. So, John David, I
want to appreciate your time. We got through a lot in 35 minutes. Kary and Steph, I'll
be annoying you to figure out what remodeled store we should tour at the summit
next year. Thank you for joining us and have a great rest of summer.

Okay. Thank you, Greg. Appreciate it. Bye.
