Good morning, and welcome to WWDC. WWDC is an incredibly important event to
Apple, our developers and our users. It's here that we bring some of our biggest
innovations to life. And we have not stopped innovating, doing the work that will
enrich people's lives for years to come, because we're all looking forward to a more
hopeful tomorrow. That's why we believe it's so important to have WWDC this year.
And while it cannot possibly feel the same in here without you, I can assure you that
we have a great show ahead of us. This year, we're delivering the conference in a
whole new way to all of you around the world directly to your home. And we want to
welcome you to our home here at Apple Park.
I'd like to first talk to you about two big things that are happening in the world right
now. To start, I want to address the topic of racism, inequality and injustice, and to
recognize the pain being felt throughout our nation, especially in our black and
Craig Federighibrown communities after the senseless killing of George Floyd. And while the events
of this past month are sadly not new, they have caused us to face long-standing
institutional inequalities and social injustices. This country was founded on the
principles of freedom and equality for all.
For too many people and for too long, we haven't lived up to those ideals. We are
inspired and moved by the passionate people around our nation and around the
world who have stood up to demand change. We must all aim far higher to build a
future that lives up to our ideals. This means taking action. Two weeks ago, we
announced Apple's racial equity and justice initiative with a commitment of $100
million, starting in the United States and expanding over time, this initiative will
challenge systemic barriers that limit opportunity for communities of color in the
critical areas of education, economic equality and criminal justice.
We also announced something important for this community, the new developer
entrepreneur account for Black developers. We want to do everything we can to
foster the brightest lights and best ideas. At Apple, our mission has always been to
make the world a better place and we're committed to being a force for change.
Right now, our world is also battling a virus that is affecting the daily lives of billions
of people. We want to thank the dedicated people everywhere, especially our
healthcare workers who have made tremendous sacrifices to take care of those in
need. We've also seen the profound impact our products have had. People are
relying on them more than ever to remain connected to family and friends, to do
their work, to express their creativity, to be entertained as well as to entertain others.
Today, the world is counting on all of us and on the products and experiences that
we create to move forward. Because throughout history great challenges have been
met with great creativity and important breakthroughs. That's why we're so excited
about this year's conference. This is going to be truly a unique week [ph], delivered
unlike any that we've done before. There will be more than 100 engineering-led
video sessions, one-on-one consultations with Apple engineers, developer forums
and so much more delivered to you from different locations right here at Apple Park.
And this year the conference will be available to our entire community of $23 million
developers as well as anyone who is interested for free.
Presenting the conference in this way allows us to be more inclusive than ever.
Perhaps this will inspire the next generation of developers. So even though we can't
be together in person, in some ways we're going to be more together than ever.
Today, we're going to push each of our platforms forward in some exciting and
breakthrough ways.
With that let's get started by sending it [ph] over to Craig.

Good morning. Great to have you here. As you can see we've got a lot to cover, so
let's get started with iOS. Together with iPhone iOS is central to how we navigate our
lives and stay connected. And now we're making it even more powerful and easier to
use. Our new release is iOS 14. This year we spent time rethinking some of the most
iconic elements of the experience on iPhone. And we started here with a carefully
considered home screen that has truly stood the test of time.
Of course, over the years, we kept the fundamentals largely the same, but carefully
added features like folders for organizing your apps, widgets for quick information
and personalized experiences powered by on-device intelligence that serve up just
the right thing, at just the right moment. It's hard to imagine iPhone without these
features now.
Well, that brings us to this year. We're doing more on our iPhones today than ever
before. So we've re-thought some of the core elements of iOS to reﬂect this. Let me
give you a quick peek.
(video presentation)
This is going to be amazing. Let's dig in starting with the home screen. Today's home
screen works great. But as we get more and more apps we can end up with this, lots
and lots of pages and we tend to forget what's beyond the first couple. Wouldn't it
be great if there was a way to organize all of those apps without doing a thing. Well
this year, we're doing just with something called the app library. It's a new space at
the end of your home screen pages that automatically organizes all your apps in one
simple and easy to navigate view.
Let me show you. Here's my home screen. Now like you I have muscle memory built
for the first page or two. But when it comes to all of these pages, well, honestly I've
lost track of where a lot of things are. And that's where the app library comes in. You
can see that all of my apps are automatically organized here. In fact now with the
app library I actually don't need all those pages for all my apps. So we created an
easy way to hide out pages. I just go into jiggle mode, tap the darts at the bottom
and check this out, I get a zoomed out view of all my pages.
I can simply tap to hide the pages I no longer need, just like that. And now with
those pages hidden, app library is always just a swipe or two away. So here in app
library, getting to the app I'm looking for is really easy. Up at the top I've the search
field and I get all my apps organized from A to Z. Now over here on the upper left, I
have suggestions, that uses on-device intelligence to show me the apps that I'm
likely to need next. And on the right is recently added, giving me access to the apps
that I have recently downloaded from the App Store.
And below are intelligently curated categories. So I can tap into a category like
Apple Arcade and see all of my apps in that category. Well, now let's go back. You
may notice that in each of these categories the apps I use most are right here at the
top level. So I can launch one of these directly with just a tap. So that's App Library.
We think this is going to make it easier than ever to get to your apps.
Next, let's turn to widgets. Today, widgets help me get information at a glance. But a
lot has changed, since we first introduced these. Now we have Apple Watch, where
we're able to surface so much information on a small screen that you wear on your
wrist. Well this year we're taking all that we've learned to create a completely re-
imagined experience for widgets. To start they're more beautiful and data rich, and
we're introducing different sizes. So you can choose one that best fits your needs.
Let's take a look at them in iOS 14.
So let's swipe over to today view and take a look at our new widgets, they're just
beautiful. And the new designs are more data rich than ever. And you can see they
now come in a variety of sizes. So you can pick just the right level of information for
each one. Now we liked these new widgets so much, we wanted to make them even
more accessible. So check this out. I'm just going to tap and hold on the weather
widget, and I can drag it out of today view and on to my home screen. And watch as
I move it around, the apps just dance out of the way to make space for my new
widget.
Well have a second one. Just kind of tap the plus here in the upper left and grab on
the podcast. I can drop it just like that. Now I'm going to swipe over to page two
here and bring back up the widget gallery. The gallery is a great place to explore
widgets. Now when I tap on one I can actually page through all of the different sizes
available, just like this. But you know right now what I want to do is grab this widget
up top. It's a really special one. It's called the smart stack. I'm just going to tap it and
drop it here.
With the smart stack I can easily swipe through widgets to pick just the one I want for
the moment. But what's really cool is that the smart stack can actually do this for me
automatically. So in the morning, I can get my news briefing. Throughout the day find
out when I have a meeting coming up. And then the evening I might get a summary
of my activity for the day. So that's widgets on the home screen. We're excited to see
how everyone will customize them in their own way.
Next, we're also bringing picture-in-picture to iPhone, so you can access apps on
your iPhone while watching video or talking on a FaceTime call. Let me show you. So
here in my home screen the Smart Stack is showing me the TV widget. So I can just
tap to start playing the show. Now check this out. When I swipe to go home, the
video automatically goes in a picture-in-picture right over the home screen. And
when I launch another app, like notes I can keep watching.
Now I can drag the picture to another part of the screen. If I want to make it bigger. I
can even pinch to zoom. And as I move between applications it stays with me. And
what's cool if I can also swipe it to the side and the audio keeps playing when it's off-
screen. Now here on the home screen, I can bring it back out if I want and I have
controls to get back to full screen playback or I can just tap the X to close it. And
that's picture-in-picture video. It's a great way to continue enjoying your video while
tapping into everything else your iPhone can do for you.
Yael GartenAnd that's a quick look at the updates to the core elements of iOS. We think these
new features are going to make iOS even more hep in a moment. Another iconic
experience that's getting a major update is Siri. As much as Siri's advanced over the
years the visual interface for interacting with it has remained largely unchanged.
When you use Siri, your iPhone switches to this old screen UI obscuring your current
context. So this year we've completely redesigned the Siri experience with a new
compact design. It makes tasks like launching apps incredibly seamless.
For example if you say open Safari. Siri pops up the bottom of the screen and
instantly launches the App. Or if you ask for information like the weather results
appear at the top of the screen, just like a notification. Now this is especially great
when there's information you want to reference on screen. For example, you could
ask Siri to add to your grocery list. So that's the new Siri design in iOS 14. But the UI is
only part of the story.
To tell you more about how we're making Siri smarter than ever, I'll hand it off to Yael
Garten.

Thanks, Craig. Siri is getting smarter and even more helpful every day, and I'm really
excited to share the latest updates with you. Siri helps you in a ton of little ways
everyday, playing the morning news, ordering a coffee, getting directions, setting
the alarm before going to bed and so much more. In fact, Siri is helping so many of
you with a staggering 25 billion requests each month, and Siri is getting more
helpful every day.
Siri's always been great for getting information and now has over 20 times more
facts than just three years ago. For more complex questions like how do hybrid cars
work, or what causes seasons, we recently introduced answers from websites across
the Internet, enabling Siri to help you find even more answers. Another way Siri
helps us with communication, like sending messages. This year, you can now ask Siri
to spend an audio message and Siri will start recording. This is great, when you really
want to have the emotion of your voice come through.
Another popular way to send messages with your voice is using dictation. Keyboard
dictation uses the same speech recognition as Siri. And leveraging the power of the
neural engine we are now able to run dictation on device. This provides great
accuracy and privacy. When communicating with someone in another language, Siri
can help with translations. This year we're expanding to support many new language
pairs. This is hugely popular, but we know our users want more than just translating
phrases.
They want to have entire conversations and we believe conversations between
languages should feel natural and easy and have the ability to stay private. That's
why we are introducing a new app called Translate. It is designed to be the best and
easiest to use app for conversations and it can work completely oﬄine, keeping your
conversations private. Using advanced on-device machine learning and the powerful
Craig Federighi
Stacey Lysikneural engine, you can translate your text and voice between any combination of
these 11 languages.
So I could have a conversation with someone in Mandarin and they could have a
conversation with someone in Russian. Just tap on the microphone and say, what are
your store hours? (foreign language) You get back the text and audio right away.
And just turn the phone to landscape to open conversation mode. We've designed a
side by side view that's easy for two people to know which side to follow in the
conversation. This mode is incredibly intuitive, with just a single microphone button
because the app intelligently detects the language spoken and shows translation on
the correct side of the screen.
Translate will make communicating between languages easier than ever before,
connecting people in new ways and we can't wait for you to try it.

Thanks, Yael. Next up, messages. Messages is how many of us communicate with
people most important to us and now we're using it more than ever. Compared to
just a year ago we have a record number of users sending a record number of
messages and we've seen people use messages more and more to keep in touch
with their closest groups. This year, we're introducing a new way to stay connected
with your most important conversations giving you new ways to express your identity
with Memoji and making big changes to how we communicate in groups.
To tell you more, here is Stacey Lysik.
Thanks, Craig. First, let's get started with conversations. From the beginning,
messages was designed to make it really easy to get to your newest messages. With
so many active conversations, sometimes it can be tough to get to the ones that are
most important to you. So we are introducing a new way to let you stay connected to
your most important conversations, by letting you pin them at the top of your list, so
you can always get to them. And you can see messages as they come in with a
beautiful animation underpinned.
Next, let's talk about expressing yourself with the Memoji. There are over 1 trillion
ways to customize your identity with Memoji. In iOS 14 we're adding even more ways
to create your look, over 20 new hair and headwear styles to let you reﬂect your
hobby, obsession and personality. We've also added something that's even more
relevant today face coverings. And we're adding more age options too. My favorite
way of using Memoji is with Memoji stickers. And now we have three brand new
Memoji stickers that let you send a hug, a fist bump, or even a blush to your friends.
Last let's chat about groups. When you're talking to a group sometimes there so
much going on it can be hard to keep track of the conversation. So this year we're
going to help you bring order to the chaos. First, we're adding in line replies that let
Craig Federighi
Meg Frostyou apply directly to a specific message. You can view replies in the full conversation
or you can view them as their own thread. So you can focus in on the specific topic.
To make it even more clear who a message was met for we're introducing mentions.
With mentions, you can just type someone's name to direct a message to them. And
now you have the ability to only be notified when you're mentioned in the group
conversation. And check out the top of this conversation with an all-new design for
how groups appear. It lets you see all the members of your group, where the most
recently active people are shown largest. And for the first time ever you can create a
unique visual identity for your group by setting a group photo, our customizing your
group's look with an Memoji.
Inside the conversation you see group member's photos around the image. Of
course it looks great as a pin. You know who's most recently commented in the
group because their photo will appear on the outside of the pin, and what's coming
to messages in iOS 14, all new pinned conversations, fun updates to Memoji and
powerful improvements to groups.

Thanks, Stacy. Next, let's take a look at features that help us while we're out and
about. Now we know that life looks very different for many of us right now. But it
won't always be this way. And as things start to open up, we have a new set of
features that will help us explore the world again, starting with maps. Apple Maps is
the best way to navigate and explore the world, all while protecting your privacy.
Over the past several years, we've added many great features and of course we've
been rebuilding our map from the ground up. Our new map finished rolling out
across the US earlier this year and brought with it better navigation and far richer
detail for roads, pedestrian pass, land cover and more. The new map also offers
more accurate information for places and allows us to build incredible features like
look around. Maps has come a long way and people have noticed. Just look at this
quote from Fast Company, Apple Maps has improved by leaps and bounds and is a
formidable rival to Google Maps. It's also arguably got the better UI and by far, by far
the better privacy policy.
We're excited to announce we're bringing our new map to more countries later this
year, including the UK, Ireland and Canada. In addition to the rich detail and
improved accuracy the new map serves as the foundation for many great new
features. In iOS 14, we're adding things that will make it easier for people to find
places they love and help them get to where they're going in ways that are better for
the environment. To tell you more, I'll hand it off to Meg Frost.
Thanks, Craig. First let's talk about finding great places. We've millions of ways [ph]
to discover great new places, whether they're planning their next big vacation or just
looking for something to eat nearby.
Craig FederighiIn iOS 14 the Maps team will be working with some of the world's most trusted
brands to offer amazing guides; guides for great places to eat, shop, meet friends or
exploring cities around the world. You can save guides, you can easily get back to
them later and the best part is that they automatically update when new places are
added, so you always have the latest recommendations. In addition to helping you
discover great new places Maps help you get there in a way that's better for the
planet.
For years Map's made it easy to navigate using environmentally friendly options like
public transit and walking. With iOS 14 we're introducing great new features to help
our users reduce their carbon footprint, and our first one is also our most requested,
it's cycling. We've done an cycling experience that helps
You get around town on your bike. We are adding a dedicated cycling option to
maps which allows users to ride their bike along bike lanes, pads and roads. Maps
takes elevation into account to let you know if you are in for a challenging whole [ph]
workout or a leisurely ﬂat ride.
You can also see if you are route includes quiet or busy roads. We even let you know
if you have a steep passage coming up or if you need to carry your bike up the stairs.
You can also choose to avoid stairs altogether. With iOS 14 we're bringing cycling to
New York City, LA, the San Francisco Bay Area, along with a number of cities in
China, like Shanghai and Beijing. And we'll be adding many more cities in the
coming months.
For environmentally conscious drivers we are also introducing EV routing. If you have
an electric car maps is going to help you eliminate range anxiety. With iOS 14 Maps
will track your current charge and factor in things like elevation and weather to
automatically add charging stops along your route. And Maps will know which type
of charger works for your car, making sure to only route you to compatible stations.
We are working with a number of manufacturers to support EV routing in their
vehicles, including BMW and Ford and we'll be adding many more in the near future.
Cities around the world are also working to improve air quality and reduce traﬃc. So
we're adding congestion and green zones to Maps to easily see where they are
along with alternate routing options. In addition, drivers in China can securely store
their license plate number on the iPhone and Maps will let them know which days
they can enter congested city centers based on that number. And those are just
some of the great new features coming to Apple Maps in iOS 14, making Maps the
best product to help users explore and navigate their world.

Thanks, Meg. And now on to CarPlay, which has transformed the driving experience
for iPhone owners by being a smarter, safer way to use the apps you love in your car.
CarPlay is everywhere and it's incredibly popular. Here in the US, it's available on
basically every new car. And worldwide, it's available on over 80% of new cars sold
and has quickly become the default in-car experience for so many people. People
Emily Schubert
Craig Federighilove CarPlay and we get some really passionate reactions. Joanna Stern says it
makes her life infinitely better. We have some great updates for iOS 14.
First up, we have new wallpaper options, perfect for the car, and we're adding
support for new categories of CarPlay apps, parking, EV charging and quick food
ordering. In addition to this, we're really excited for the next step in how we're
transforming your relationship with your car by rethinking car keys. They've been
around for over 100 years, but they become big, bulky and ripe for re-imagining. To
tell you more about what we have planned, let's go to the garage with Emily
Schubert.

Thanks, Craig. I'm excited to introduce a digital version of car keys. Now you can
leave your keys at home and unlock and start your car with your iPhone. And the very
first car to support this will be the new 2021 BMW 5 Series. Let me show you how it
works. It's super-simple. It uses NFC and you just tap to unlock. And I place my
phone on the charging pad and then push to start.
But this goes beyond just one less thing you have to keep in your pocket. Digital
keys have security benefits. They live in a secure element of your iPhone and if it
goes missing you can turn off your keys remotely, via iCloud. They are even easier to
share than a physical key. Copies don't involve trips to the dealership. And you can
share from wherever you are with iMessage.
Let's give Craig a key so he can drive home after we're done here. With each key you
share, you can set options, like a restricted driving profile, perfect for teen drivers,
which is tempting but we'll Craig full access.

Full access. Thanks, Emily. The new BMW will be available to customers next month.
In addition to adding this feature in iOS 14, we're also enabling it in iOS 13, so
customers can use their car keys even sooner. Of course, we want this to work in any
car. So we've been working on standards with industry groups, and this is just the
beginning. We're working on technology to leverage our U1 chip which uses ultra-
wideband technology for precise spatial awareness. So you'll be able to leave your
iPhone in your bag or pocket and still securely unlock and start your car. We expect
to see support for this standard starting in new cars next year.
Now let's turn to the App Store. 12 years ago, we revolutionized the industry with the
launch of the App Store. Today, we have so many amazing apps that offer a rich set
of experiences we can truly say that for everything we want to do, there is an app for
that. So now it's time for us to extend the success of the App Store and make apps
available and accessible in whole new ways.
What if you could have the right app you needed at just the right moment? Let's
look at what it would be like if you did.
(Video Presentation)
An app clip is a small part of an app. It's a light and fast and easy to discover, so you
can quickly get what you need right when you need it. Everything about App clips is
designed for speed. They start with this card which quickly pops up and with just a
tap you can launch the App clip. You don't need to enter credit card numbers,
because App Cliffs can use Apple Pay for payments. And you don't have to manually
log into an account because it can take advantage of sign-in with Apple. App clips
won't clutter your home screen, and will only stay along as long as you need them.
But you could easily launch recently used app clips from the new app library. It's
always easy to download the full app and this makes App clips an easy way to
discover more of what the App Store has to offer. And discovery is key. App clips are
all about getting to a part of an app at the moment you need it. So it was critical that
we made them really easy to find. App clips can be easily discovered and launch
from the web.
You can launch app clips for messages when friends share them with you, when you
want to order takeout from a restaurant in Maps you can launch your app clip right
from a place card. You'll be able to tap on NFC tags out in the world on things like
parking meters or you can scan QR codes to launch App clips that work with
products you purchase. The best way to discover app clips will be with the new
Apple designed app clip code. So when you see one, you'll know that there is an
app clip waiting for you.
They incorporate both a visual code and NFC, so you tap on them or scan them with
the camera to bring up an app clip. App clips will be great for businesses that
already have apps. But we want to be able to use app clips everywhere, including
smaller spots that may not have their own app. So we made it possible for apps like
Yelp, which support multiple businesses to create App clip experiences for each of
the places they work with.
Developers will create app clips from a part of an app using X code and the full
power of the SDK. To ensure that they launch quickly, they'll need to be less than 10
megabytes in size, and that's App Clips, immediately discoverable, small in size, so
they launch fast, integrated Apple Pay for easy payment, sign in with Apple for quick
and privacy friendly login and the option to download the full app from the App
Store when you want to keep it around. We can't wait to see all the App clips
developers will create. And that's iOS 14.
It's a huge release that transforms the core experience of iPhone with redesigned
widgets right on the home screen and a new way to organize your apps with the app
library. It has incredible updates to some of the most popular apps with powerful
improvements to messages and maps and introduces a whole new way to tap into
apps with App clips.
And next up, iPad OS.
Joshua Shaffer(Video Presentation)
Okay. We've made it. All right, well, let's jump right in. iPad OS builds on all the
amazing features of IOS, while adding unique capabilities that deliver a distinct
experience for iPad, like using Apple pencil for taking notes, markup, an illustration,
a re-imagined trackpad experience that lets you interact with iPad in a whole new
way, and unmatched AR experiences with ARKit and the amazing new LiDAR Scanner
in iPad Pro. All of this combines to put iPad into a class of its own.
IPad excels at every type of input, and is a product to do anything and everything,
which brings us to this year and our new release iPadOS 14. Let's start with
experience. This year, iPadOS delivers unique made for iPad designs, that's a great
advantage of the iPad's large multi-touch display. The iPad has always been about
the apps.
In the beginning, we focused on giving the ecosystem of iPhone apps a larger
canvas to deliver new and unique experiences. This quickly sparked an entirely new
set of apps designed for iPad first, with immersive experiences that transform this
magical sheet of glass into whatever you needed it to be. We're proud of the over 1
million apps on the App Store today designed just for iPad. With customers
continuing to push their iPads further than ever before, we're extending the design
language of iPad to make apps more streamlined and more powerful.
To give you a live look at these enhancements, I'll hand it over to Josh Shaffer.
Thanks, Craig. Let's take a look at some of the enhancements to iPad OS. The first
you'll notice are the same redesigned widgets that you saw in iOS 14. They look
great on iPad as well, and they give you information at a glance whenever you go
home. But let's see some of the improvements in the apps, starting with photos.
IPad is the perfect device for browsing your photos. It's large canvas lets you
immerse yourself in all your favorite memories, and this year we're making it even
easier to browse and organize your photos with an all-new sidebar. With just a tap of
this button I can reveal the sidebar with all the core functionality of the app in a
single location. My photos remain front and center. But now I can quickly tap to
move between parts of the app. The sidebar is a really powerful way to organize
your photos to. I can easily drag a photo to the sidebar and then just drop it to add it
to an album.
We've brought this sidebar to many apps across iPadOS, like notes where it provides
quick and easy access to all your folders. And files where we've consolidated
navigation into the sidebar for a streamlined new design. We've also streamlined the
toolbars adding new drop down menus that consolidate functions into a single easy
to access button. I can just tap to change views like this. And for even quicker access
I can just tap and drag to change the sort order all in a single motion.
Craig FederighiYou'll find the same approach across other apps like calendar, where we've brought
controls into a single toolbar at the top providing more space for your content and a
single unified place to access all the apps functionality. Finally music has been
updated to take even better advantage of iPad's large screen. The sidebar in music
makes it easy to move between views. I can quickly jump between the new listen
now in my playlists. And once I start playing a song, I can bring up the brand new full
stream player, where I can see rich album art, transport controls and lyrics all in one
single view.
And these are just some of the enhancements that are coming to Apps and iPad OS.

We're really loving these new app designs, but there is more. Starting with Siri, the
new compact Siri design that you heard about in iOS 14 is especially useful in iPad.
Results appear at the bottom right corner allowing you to easily reference the App
while using Siri.
And we applied the same approach to other parts of the experience, like calls. Now
today when you receive a call on iPad you see this. Whatever you were working on is
suddenly completely covered with the incoming call screen. Not cool. Wouldn't it be
nicer if instead, you saw this? That's much better. Now an incoming call is presented
with a compact notification, that doesn't take you out of context. And you can simply
tap to answer or ﬂick it away to dismiss. And this applies to all calls, including those
from your iPhone or third party VOIP apps like Skype. And of course we're bringing
this to iOS as well.
We think our iPhone customers are going to love it. Now there is one more key
experience we've redesigned for iPad this year, and that's search. Today search is a
full screen experience, and sometimes you can lose track of your context. So we've
redesigned search with a new compact design. You can start a search from anywhere
like the home screen or over any app. And this makes it easy to find what you need
without feeling like you've left the App you're working in.
But we didn't just redesign it. We've rebuilt search from the ground up, to be
universal, becoming a single destination where you can start all of your searches.
First, we made it better than ever as an app launcher. You just start typing a few
characters and you can instantly get to where you're going. It's also great for funding
contacts to message or call or documents. You can even search directly into apps
like keynote, messages, mail or files or look at information about people or places.
And it's also a great place to start all of your web searches as well.
As soon as you start typing you get relevant suggestions to complete your search
and you can get to your web search results with just a tap. And search now makes
navigating to your favorite websites, just as easy as launching an app. Just type a few
letters and then tap it will take you right to Safari. So those are some of our updates
to the iPad experience and of course you get the new widgets and all the other great
App enhancements from iOS 14.
Jenny ChenNext, we want to push forward your ability to express yourself creatively, with
improvements to Apple Pencil. Apple Pencil is a game changing tool that turns iPad
into a professional drawing canvas, a great way to mark up and sign documents and
the ultimate note taking device. What many people love most about taking notes
with Apple pencil is how they can express themselves in a free form way. Mixing
handwriting and drawings can be the best way to capture your thoughts. Now the
challenge is, when you want to change things afterwards. Here working with
handwriting just isn't as easy as with typed text.
Now we sometimes take it for granted, but with typed text it's so easy to select, copy
and paste into another document or even just make space for more text. Well, this
year we're going to make handwriting just easy and just as powerful, but that's not
all. Our customers tell us that, once they have an Apple pencil in their hand, they
don't want to put it away. So this year we're bringing Scribble to iPad. So you can
hand write into any text field and it will automatically be converted to text.
To show you all of this in action, I'd like to welcome Jenny Chen for a live demo.

Thanks, Craig. I'm really excited to show you some of the great new features that we
have for Apple Pencil and iPadOS this year. One of the great parts about taking
notes with the Apple Pencil is that it really let you work in a free form way. I can just
start writing anywhere. And it's not just about text. I can also express myself with
drawings or sheets, but sometimes you want that more professional cleaned up look
and so now when I draw a simple shape and pause at the end it'll automatically
convert to that ideal shape. And we're smart about it, retaining the same size, an
angle that you drew it at.
In addition to shapes, we've also made huge improvements to our handwriting
recognition. So now when I write I can easily make a selection using the same
gestures that I use for type text. I can double tap to select a word or double tap
again to select a line. Thanks to our advanced on-device machine learning you'll
notice, how we can ﬂex the handwriting, while avoiding the drawings nearby.
Now that I have the selection I can easily change the color or move it around the
document. It's also perfectly easy for me to make space for more room to write. We
think that this will make note taking with Apple Pencil even better, and now you don't
even have to put it down when you want to do something else.
Let's say you want to search for Edison bulbs, in Safari. Using Scribble, I can just write
directly into the text field. And it automatically gets converted to typed text. It also
works in any tax field. So I can easily add a new reminder to my shared reminders list
with my husband. I've also been learning Chinese. So I want to surprise him with
some of my progress and skills. I use scratch and delete light. And then I can use
Scribble to write new, and then light fixture in Chinese. You'll notice how Scribble
recognizes both English and Chinese, in the same line.
Craig Federighi
Mary-Ann IonascuAnd this also means that we can build on this technology to deliver other great
features like data detectors. We can automatically detect what you write, like phone
numbers, so I can make a phone call or addresses, so I can look up directions. We
can use these features together to do even more with your handwriting. Let's say I
want to use my handwriting in another app. I can easily select what I want. Tap the
new copy of text from the call up bar and then paste it into an app like Pages and it's
automatically converted to typed text.
We're really excited about these awesome new features that we'll think will let you
do even more with the Apple Pencil.

Thanks, Jenny. So those are the enhancements to pencil. Just one part of an amazing
release with Scribble for handwriting into any text field, a whole new way to work
with your hand written notes, broad enhancements to the app experience and of
course iPad users also benefit from the great features you already saw in iOS 14 and
much more that we didn't have time to talk about. So that's iOS and iPadOS.
Next, let's talk about AirPods. From the one click set up to the automatic pairing with
all your devices, to how they pause your audio when you take them out, people love
the magical experience that AirPods deliver. Now we're bringing even more magic
to AirPods. To tell you all about it, here's Mary-Ann Ionascu.
Thanks, Craig. We have some amazing updates coming to AirPods, starting with
automatic switching. AirPods will now seamlessly move between their devices
without you having to manually switch them. Let's say you just finished listening to a
podcast and you pick up your iPad to watch a show. AirPods will magically
switchover and later you start a video conference on your mac. AirPods will
automatically switch again. And if a phone call comes in, the audio in your AirPods
route will right back to your phone. We also have an exciting new feature coming to
AirPods Pro, spatial audio.
You know the experience of being in a movie theater with a state-of-the-art surround
sound system, one where the sound not only comes from in front of you, but also
from the left, the right, behind and even from above you. Well, we are thrilled to
bring that same immersive experience to AirPods Pro. But it turns out, it's a lot harder
to do when you only have a single ear bud in each year. So our team created
advanced spatial audio algorithms for AirPods Pro that replicate the movie theater
experience.
By applying directional audio filters and suddenly adjusting the frequencies each ear
receives we can play sounds virtually anywhere in space, creating an immersive
surround sound experience. But to truly deliver on this promise, we had to factor in
real life situations. First people move their heads. For an authentic surround sound
Craig Federighi
Kevin Lynchexperience, you need the sound field to stay fixed. So the voice feels like it's coming
from the actor and not some random point in space.
So we used the accelerometer and gyroscopes in AirPods Pro to track the motion of
your head remapping the sound field so it stays anchored to your device even as
your head moves. And it's not only your head that can move, but you might move
your iPad or iPhone as well. That's why we constantly compare the motion data from
your head and your screen, to understand how they're moving in relation to each
other.
So if your bus turns the corner or your plane banks the sound stays in sync. The
result is the surround sound experience that keeps you in the middle of the action,
no matter where you go. Special audio for AirPods Pro will work with content
encoded in 5.1, 7.1 and even Dolby Atmos.

Thanks Mary-Ann. I've been using the new spatial audio and I think you're all really
going to love it. All right. Next, let's head to the fitness center to hear the latest on
watchOS from Kevin.
(Video Presentation)

Thanks Craig. Since we launched Apple Watch, it's completely redefined what a
watch can do, and this has been incredibly meaningful work. Apple Watch not only
helps you stay connected and active, it's become an intelligent guardian of your
health, enabling you to take an ECG, detect falls and call emergency services for you.
It's impacting lives in ways that were inconceivable five years ago.
The power of Apple Watch is not only its built-in features, but how developers have
personalized it for you. We introduced the App Store and watchOS 6 and there are
now over 20,000 watchOS apps available. These apps bring the information you
care about most, through just a glance at your watch face. And we're taking this even
further in watchOS 7, starting with complications.
Until today an app could appear only once part of the time on a watch face. In
watchOS 7 developers can enable multiple complications, making even more richly
personal watch faces. So if you'd like to use Dawn Patrol for surfing, you can create
your own surf watch including water, temperature, swell and wind speed predictions
for your favorite beach. Or new parents can use Glow Baby to see nap, changing and
feeding times all in one phase, while Nike run club can display stats like pace from
your last run and your weekly run goals.
We're also bringing rich complications to more phases, including a fresh
chronograph phase with an integrated tech emitter and an updated extra-large face
Julz Arneywith a huge rich complication, right in the center. And configuring watch faces has
been redesigned, so you can easily select which information you'd like to see. As
developers with watchOS 7, you can now build your rich complications with native
SwiftUI.
While there are so many ways to configure watch faces, you may not have gone in
and set these up for yourself yet. That's okay. With watchOS 7, we're making it super
easy to share watch faces. So you can discover a phase that works perfectly for you.
To do this, we're introducing face sharing. You'll be able to discover curated faces
with third-party apps on the App Store or discover a favorite watch face right on our
website., or receive watch faces directly from friends and family.
Let's take a look at how this works. When you see a watch face you like, you just
press, add up a watch face. If the watch face uses some apps that you don't have yet,
you will be offered each one right here, so you can easily get them if you like. And
the new face appears right on your watch. If you'd like to share a face you've created
yourself that's also really easy. Just long press on the face, tap share, pick a contact
and send. Developers can offer pre-configured watch faces right from their apps.
You can even share watch faces across social media. It's a great way for the
community of Apple Watch wearers to connect and help each other discover all the
amazing things Apple Watch is capable of.
Next, let's talk about Maps. Maps is great for walking, driving and transit directions.
And now in watchOS just like in iOS 14, you can get cycling directions. You'll see a
variety of routes with information like time, distance and whether there are bike
lanes. You can preview travel time, and elevation changes and navigate with turn by
turn directions that are large and easy to read. Maps can direct you to dismount and
walk your bike or even take the stairs to save time. You can also search for and add
places optimized for cyclists, like bike repair shops.
Now to tell you about how we're advancing workouts, please welcome Julz Arney.
Thanks, Kevin. The workout app uses algorithms that are smartly tuned to track all
aspects of your training. It's one of the most used apps on Apple Watch and we've
continued to add support for new workout types every year. And in watchOS 7, we're
adding dance. Dance is a total body workout that's great for your heart. It makes you
more fit and ﬂexible and you're guaranteed to have fun.
Whether you're doing hip-hop, Latin, Bollywood or simply cardio dance, the workout
app now tracks some of the world's most popular styles of dance for fitness. Getting
the most accurate credit for dance represented a unique challenge. Our movements
aren't always repetitive or synchronized leg movements, like in running and walking.
The solution was to use advanced sensor fusion. In dance, we combine data from the
accelerometer and the gyroscope to detect the difference between dancing with just
your arms, just your lower body or when you put it altogether and dance with your
Kevin Lynch
Vera Carrentire body. Then we add in heart rate data for the most accurate calorie burned
calculation.
WatchOS 7 also tracks accurate calories for core training, those exercises for your abs
and back. Functional strength training, a workout type that helps you get stronger
and move better for everyday activities, and also Cooldown to add on to another
workout when you want to continue with easy moves and stretches as you bring your
heart rate and breathing back to normal. Of course, you can track your progress for
any of these new workouts inside the activity app on iPhone which is completely
redesigned in watchOS 7.
The app now features the new summary tab that gives you an easy way to see your
activity history, workouts and trend all in one screen with you. With the new focus on
easy navigation and summary metrics, the App is getting a new name as well,
Fitness.
Back to you, Kevin.

Thanks, Julz. Apple Watch helps you meet not only your fitness goals, but also helps
support your health, with features such as cycle tracking, the breathe app and noise
notifications. And we're going to be adding even more capabilities this year in
watchOS 7. We'd like to share a couple of them with you today, starting with one of
the most requested features for Apple Watch, tracking your sleep. To tell you about
this, over to Vera Carr.

Thanks, Kevin. There are many ways to look at sleep. Scores, advanced monitoring or
sleep cycle analysis. We are taking more holistic approach to sleep by leveraging the
devices you use everyday to not only track your sleep, but to support you and
actually meeting your sleep duration goal. That's also choosing not only when you
would like to wake up in the morning, but also when you would like to go to bed.
For most of us, setting a goal is easy, but getting to bed on time, that's the hard part.
Experts say that establishing a bedtime routine helps the body transition from
wakefulness to sleep. So we are offering wind down. It can help you get to bed on
time by minimizing distractions and creating a personalized routine. Let's look at
how this works.
In the evening ahead of your bedtime, your phone can display the wind down
screen to help you transition mentally before you go to bed. It creates the calm lock
screen experience and turns on do not disturb for you. You can also setup shortcuts
for simple things you may like to do to help you prepare for bed. These might
include using your favorite meditation app or playing relaxing music. Once it's time
for bed, your screen will dim and your watch will go in to sleep mode, which looks
like this.
Kevin Lynch
Craig FederighiThe screen will be off during time of bed, so it won't bother you and a tap displays
this simple face. When it's time to wake up, you have a selection of gentle and
effective alarm sounds or a silent tactic only wake up, alarm, so you don't disturb
your partner. Once you're up, you'll see a friendly greeting easing you into the day. It
also shows you battery level, so you can remember to charge in the morning.
Apple Watch tracks your sleep using a machine learning model that senses your
motion and even interprets the micro movements caused by the rise and fall of your
breath, providing signals for when you're awake and when you're sleep. There is an
updated sleep section in health app including a view of your trends over time. Sleep
schedules, wind down and sleep mode are also available on iPhone without a Watch
in iOS 14. We know you'll enjoy using Watch throughout the day and now throughout
the night.

Thanks, Vera. In addition to sleep keeping your healthy there's another preventative
care item that's so important particularly now, hand washing. In watchOS 7 Apple
Watch is the first watch to deliver automatic detection when you start washing your
hands and sensing of how long you actually wash. Our approach here is using
machine learning models to determine motion, which appears to be hand-washing
and then use audio to confirm the sound of running water or squishing soap on your
hands.
During this you'll get a little coaching to do a good job, you'll see a countdown
along with haptics and sounds to make sure you wash as long as you're supposed to.
If you pause early, there is a plate note to keep washing. And when you're done
you'll see here and feel it. That's just some of what's coming this year in watchOS 7
including discovering and sharing faces, new workout types, sleep and hand-
washing detection and other new capabilities like Siri language translation.
And that's Apple Watch. It's time for you to join Craig again to talk about something
that's important to all of us. Here We go.

At Apple we believe privacy is a fundamental human right. So we build it into our
products from the beginning of the design process. Privacy matters now more than
ever, and because our devices contain the most sensitive information, all of our
product work is grounded in a set of privacy principles.
First, data minimization. We use innovative technologies and techniques to minimize
the personal data we or anyone else can access. Second on-device intelligence. We
avoid data collection by processing as much of your information on your device as
we can, rather than sending it to a server. Third, security, security protections are
foundational to everything we do in privacy. And finally transparency and control. It
Katie Skinner
Erik Neuenschwander
Katie Skinner
Erik Neuenschwanderhelps you better understand the data being collected so that you can make your
own choices about how that data is used.
These principles come together across our products, in our hardware, our software
and our services. At the end of the day they result in great privacy and great ease of
use. A powerful example of this is sign-in with Apple, which is designed for
simplicity, security and privacy and since we launched it last year users have created
over 200 million accounts across a wide variety of apps and websites. And
developers are seeing great usage when they adopt it.
For example, Kayak has integrated with sign-in Apple and found that their users are
now two times more likely to use it then any other sign-in provider. Now one thing
we hear a lot with sign-in with Apple is that people wish they could convert their
existing accounts to use it. So this year we're going to enable developers to let you
do just that. When you upgrade you get the ease of use and built-in security of sign-
in with Apple while keeping the account that you already have.
This is another big year of privacy improvements in our products and to tell you
more, here's Katie Skinner and Erik Neuenschwander.
Thanks, Craig. First let's talk about location. This year we're continuing to give you
even more control. In addition to the option of sharing your precise location, you
have the option to only share your approximate location with us.
We're also making changes for mic and camera, so you always know when you're
recording. In addition to requiring your permission this year, we're adding more
visibility for current or recent mic or camera use. So if an app uses either one we will
indicate that in the status bar.
Next, let's talk about tracking. Safari's intelligent tracking prevention has been really
successful on the web and this year we want to help you with tracking in apps. We
believe tracking should always be transparent and under your control. So moving
forward App Store policy will require apps to ask before tracking you across apps
and websites owned by other companies.
Last, let's talk about app privacy. Today we require that apps have a privacy policy.
Wouldn't it be great to even more quickly and easily see a summary of an apps
privacy practices before you download it. Now where we've seen something like that
before? For Food you have nutrition labels. You can see if it's packed with protein or
loaded with sugar or maybe both, all before you buy it. So we thought it would be
Katie Skinner
Erik Neuenschwander
Craig Federighi
Yah Casongreat to have something similar for apps. We're going to require each developer to
self-report their practices.
We'll show you what they tell us. You can see if the developers collecting a little bit
of data on you or a lot of data, or if they're sharing data with other companies to
track you and much more.
We're going to put this information on product pages in the App Store. So for each
app, you can see highlights of their privacy information before you download it and
we're going to include this in all of our App Stores. Back over to you, Craig.

Thanks Katie and Erik. These are some of the ways we're strengthening the privacy of
our platforms and bringing new features to give users even more control. And one of
the places where privacy matters most is your home. Like most of you in the past few
months, I've spent more time at home than I ever imagined. It's more clear than ever
just how important it is to live in a home where the technology just works. And that
brings us to some great new features we're bringing to the home this year.
All of these features share few key attributes. First, anything we developed for the
home should be easy, from initial setup to everyday use. Just like how tap of your
iPhone can automatically configure an Apple TV. Second, home products should
never compromise your privacy. That's why your Siri request use a random identifier,
not your Apple ID. And finally your devices should all work better together, like how
AirPlay lets your share from your iPhone straight to the TV.
And when things are easy, private and work together seamlessly your home is more
enjoyable. Whether you're watching TV, listening to music or getting the most out of
your smart devices. To tell you more about what we have in store for the home, let
me pass it to Yah Cason.
Thanks, Craig. Let's start by talking about the smart home. With HomeKit, we've
given developers a robust framework to create smart home accessories that are
remarkably easy to set up, all while being end-to-end encrypted to your Apple
devices. Already there is a risk ecosystem of devices available, but we want to make
it even easier to build products that work across more homes. So we formed an
alliance and partnered with Amazon, Google and other industry leaders to define a
new interoperability standards for the smart home. We open sourced HomeKit to
ensure ease of use and privacy are core to this effort.
Cindy LinAnd any accessory using HomeKit or this new standard will work incredibly well
across all your Apple devices and you control it all in the home app, the most secure
way to manage your smart home. Adding new devices to your home has never been
easier. Simply tap or scan to set up an accessory, and in iOS 14 after you add an
accessory, the home app will now suggest useful automations so you can
immediately put a new device to work for you.
Automations are rules that set your homes to autopilot, like automatically time on
your porch lights when motion is detected, or having the garage door open as you
arrive home. And now when you open the home app you'll see a new visual status
right at top that prioritize the accessories which most need your attention. You can
easily see if you left the door unlocked, or the lights on and quickly control them.
Let's take a closer look to one of the most popular categories of HomeKit
accessories, lights. Millions of us have already added smart bulbs to our homes,
many of which can change color on demand. In iOS 14, we're introducing a feature
to help you get the most out of those bulbs, adaptive lighting. Adaptive lighting
automatically adjusts the color temperature of your lights throughout the day, turn it
on to ease into the morning with warm colors, stay focused and alert mid-day with
cooler ones and wind down at night by reducing blue light. Adaptive lighting
ensures you get the right color at the right time.
Another popular smart home category is cameras. With HomeKit secure video, your
cameras are completely private. And in iOS 14 we're making your cameras work even
harder for you. You will be able to define activity zones that focus on the most
important areas. This is great if you face a busy sidewalk and only want to be alerted
when people actually walk up to your front door.
Another powerful feature we're bringing to cameras is face recognition. HomeKit
cameras and video doorbells will now provide even richer notifications telling you,
who's thereby leveraging the friends and family you already tagged in your photos
apps. And face recognition extends the HomePod announcing who is at the door.
And with Apple TV, you'll get a live view whenever someone rings the bell.
In fact all your HomeKit enabled cameras will be directly integrated with tvOS 14 so
you can quickly bring them up in the new Home View and Control Center or just ask
Siri to ﬂip any camera at any time. You can even take any camera full screen to give
you a great view of what's going on. And we have even more coming to tvOS 14.
Now, let me pass it to Cindy Lin to tell you about it.

Thanks, Yah. Apple TV is my favorite way to unwind and enjoy entertainment with the
family. With 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, you get a theater-like
experience right in your living room, making all your movies and shows look and
sound amazing. But Apple TV goes beyond video. You can access the entire Apple
music collection and even sing along with timed lyrics. You can play an incredible
Craig Federighiselection of games, including all the games in Apple Arcade and we're making
gaming on Apple TV even more personal by extending multi-user support.
Now you can instantly resume your games exactly where you left off. Just open
control center to switch between users and you can now see your game progress,
achievements and friends. And for even more fun, we're adding support for Xbox
Elite 2 and Xbox adaptive controllers. Apple TV also helps you keep active at home
with a great selection of fitness apps. And with tvOS 14, we're going to make your
workouts and everything you do on Apple TV even more productive by extending
picture in picture across the entire Apple TV experience. So you can keep up with
the news or not miss a second of the big game.
You can even have an AirPlay session show up in a picture in picture window. And
AirPlay is getting even better. Now the whole family can share their stunning videos
captured on iPhone in their full 4K resolution. With videos, music, games and more,
Apple TV truly offer something for everyone. Of course, nothing compares to be
encaptivated by good story. And we've built a service for just that, Apple TV+. We've
already created an incredible lineup of Apple originals and you can watch them all in
the Apple TV app, which is available on your favorite Apple devices and all major
streaming boxes and many popular smart TVs. It's already reaching over a 1 billion
screens and it's coming to Sony and Vizio's smart TVs later this summer.
Today, we're really excited to tell you about a new Apple TV+ original that we're
working on. Almost 70 years ago, Isaac Asimov introduced the world to a series of
epic novels that span hundreds of world and thousands of years. Many consider it to
be the best science fiction series of all time. I would like to share a sneak peek with
you now. This is Foundation.
(Video Presentation)
Well, I am super excited to watch Foundation when it comes to Apple TV+ next year.
With Apple TV, your home has never been more entertaining. And with adaptive
lighting, face recognition for cameras and these other great features your time at
home has never been more enjoyable.
Now, let me hand it back to Craig.

Welcome back. Now, let's talk about some big changes coming to macOS. Since its
introduction, macOS has revolutionized the experience of using a computer, by
combining incredible power with incredible ease of use. And it's loved by all
different types of users from families and students to creative pros, business people
and of course software developers. And this year, we're taking the macOS
experience you love even further.
Alan Dye
Craig FederighiBut what should we call it. Well, if you're student of macOS, you know this question
can only be answered by Apple's legendary crack marketing team. Their drug-fueled
mini driven vision quest have yielded some great names and sadly spawned a host
of imitators. The truth is, we can't responsibly continue to inadvertently lead our
competition to copy of these methods when they clearly can't handle the trip. So this
year, we're leaving our process shrouded in mystery and taking you straight to the
glorious destination.
Our next release of macOS is macOS Big Sur. macOS Big Sur introduces an entirely
new design and major updates to some of the most essential apps on the platform.
And just like its name, Big Sur brings you unmatched levels of power and beauty.
Let's start with design, where we're making the biggest change since the
introduction of macOS X. To tell you more about the philosophy and incredible
craftsmanship behind the new design, here's a short video with Alan Dye.

At Apple design has always been about great ideas. Those ideas, then are
developed with this obsessive dedication to detail. If we care enough about all the
details and make our products then in the end we will design an experience that
really feels like there's no other way to be. And the best example of this is macOS
Big Sur.
Our goal was to bring even more clarity to the design of the software, while retaining
the mac's powerful capabilities and ease of use. We started with the simplest
developments from the shape of the corner radius to refinements in buttons and
controls. And we brought our unified language of symbols to the mac making it
more consistent and easier to recognize. Depth, shading and translucency are used
to create hierarchy. These new materials are rich and they are vibrant. They bridge
light and dark. We've reduced the visual complexity to keep the focus on users
content.
Buttons and controls appear when you need them and they recede when you don't.
There's a new way to access system level controls and a unified space for
notifications and widgets. We've also created a new suite of sounds that are familiar
to the mac but remastered and more refined. We wanted consistency throughout the
ecosystem, so users can move ﬂuidly between their Apple devices. But we also love
the mac icon to have a deep history and a distinct look and feel. So we retained
many of the highly crafted details and the playful elements that make mac icon's
unique.
This OS reﬂects an important history. It's familiar but it's also entirely new in every
detail. We love the mac, is the tool we use to make all the products that we put out
into the world and macOS Big Sur is where it starts.
