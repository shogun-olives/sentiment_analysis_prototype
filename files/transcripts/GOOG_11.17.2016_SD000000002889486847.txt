Oliver. Good morning. You talked a bit about pulling together all of these disparate
assets that Google has to delight the consumer and in moments leveraging the
different tools from hotels to ﬂights to Zagat. Can you talk a bit about the
monetization strategy? You touched on the commission model on the hotel front. But
as you pull all of these together, talk a little bit about how you work with the
conﬂicting interest sometimes between the media model and more of a commission
channel model?
So with the new product, the new destination experience that we showed, this is an
early product for us still. So we are still ﬂexible on the exact monetization model for
that product. We tend to focus on the user first and worry about monetization
second. But it is including ﬂights and hotels and it's actually leveraging the products
that we have for ﬂights and hotels. So our existing monetization models for ﬂights
and hotels continue to work. But I think it's also obvious if you watch closely that
there are new opportunities coming from that product, for example, in the package
space. These are early thoughts for us. We want to first get this right for the user and
then worry about the monetization. But I think there are exciting opportunities.

A - Oliver HeckmannI imagine with your YouTube and shopping experience coming over to the travel
vertical, pulling all these assets together is a big ambition of yours. Can you talk a
little bit more about that? Today was a little peek into where you are headed. But
there are many assets that you didn't lean into as much in that demo.
Yes. So I only mentioned a subset of the things that we are doing given there was
limited time and I wanted to have enough time to show you the demo and, as
Elizabeth mentioned, I've been moving over to the travel space a year ago and I was
working on YouTube before -- something I generally feel, by the way, that we are not
fully leveraging -- you guys are not fully leveraging in the travel industry is actually
the insane power that YouTube has. The amount of content that is there is actually
mind-boggling. Every single hotel that I have stayed since I've moved over and work
on travel has actually multiple YouTube videos available and there are surprisingly
few ads for hotels shown in the context of these videos. So there are clear
opportunities there.

So as a consumer, I certainly see how my United ﬂight data goes from Google Mail to
my calendar and I would just love to get Google's perspective on data strategy -- the
collection, ownership, privacy. Many of those questions come up when you
experience that kind of data movement.
Yes, privacy is actually a topic that's important for us and as you know or might not
know, there is something that's called the Google Dashboard that is creating
transparency over the data that we have and the different services that Google has to
the user. And it's using pretty clear language and it's giving the user full control and
ownership of the data. And we feel that that's an important thing to do and as the
user is in control and ownership of the data, he is more willing to have that data be
used for us to create some delightful experiences. If the user is not opting out of
those services, what we can do is we can, from the email receipt in his inbox, for
example, that's a new version of Gmail, we can show you your travel information
more structured so you don't have to -- you are landing in Paris; you are on roaming;
you need to find your hotel and then the faster we can actually get you to that
information, the more delightful and the less stressful your travel experience is going
to be.

But as you can imagine, from the supplier side and your partner side, there are some
issues that are raised around that. Just thoughts for those in the audience that may
think of that more as their data and how that is used on the platform?
Yes. What we are doing and I showed this earlier when we said Book on Google,
what we want to do here is we might actually share the user information with the
supplier so that the supplier has the full information they would get if that userA - Elizabeth Harz

A - Oliver Heckmannwould go directly to their page. The goal here is really to decrease the friction and
offer -- the user will have less friction in the actual purchase process. But he will have
the same experience because I'm buying the ticket from Lufthansa and Lufthansa has
my email address and I'm getting the same email from Lufthansa that I would be
getting if I would go to their page, create an account there, sign up manually on my
mobile phone, enter all my address information and so on. That would be more
friction. But it will lead to the same outcome.

I have more questions but, Rod, you can't be quiet this long; you are going to --.

Right. You mustn't hog the ﬂoor. I've been waiting for a long time to get on the
couch with you, Oliver. I feel, on behalf of at least a portion of the industry, that we
need to talk about our relationship. I think a lot of us felt that we were in a
committed, exclusive relationship and now with the stuff that you've been doing with
ﬂights and hotels and what we saw today, man, it looks like you are playing the field.
I guess a lot of us are thinking how is this relationship going to play out now. Are you
going to be the sort of partner -- because we felt we had this great partnership -- are
you going to be the sort of partner that is committed to making it work and is open
and wants to talk about it and find a way to make it work?
That's why I'm here, yes.

Don't interrupt your partner.

Okay, that sounds good. Because we wouldn't want you to be the sort of partner that
just said, well, that's how it is; deal with it. As Douglas so succinctly put it yesterday in
his intro, he said maybe Google is biting the hand that feeds it. Is that a discussion
that you have inside Google?
First, generally, biting the hand that feeds you is not a good business strategy. And
that's not what we are doing. Very clear we are not becoming an OTA. Google has
actually been in the travel space since the beginning of Google. From the first day
that we launched, users came to Google and asked us questions around traveling.
And it's not just ﬂights and hotels. They have all kinds of questions that actually only
Google and other search engines are answering them. Are there poisonous animals
on Hawaii? Until which months can my pregnant wife still ﬂy?? Are there good
hospitals close by? Where can I buy camping equipment after I land in Honolulu? Do
I need a visa for entering Russia with a German passport? There are all kinds of
questions. (inaudible) travel planning just means looking up a ﬂight and a hotel and
clicking on the book links.A - Rod Cuthbert

That's all well and good. But the industry that you see here before you and I think
Phocuswright really demonstrates what a considerable industry it is and a lot of fun
too, the Amadeus party last night, I just want to say well done to the Amadeus team.
Actually, on that topic, let me add something. I have worked on YouTube for almost
nine years. I've been the creator person there so I've been working with the music
industry, with Hollywood and with all the YouTube stars. So I have seen a lot of crazy
parties in my past nine years. But I have to say you guys beat the music industry in
partying and I didn't expect that.

Oliver, we have a question from the audience. (multiple speakers).

What I wanted to say was, it's all very well that you've been answering all those
questions. But the industry that you see here before you, a large part of it was built
by intermediaries, people like Expedia and Booking.com and TripAdvisor and Viator
and Rome2rio and all sorts of other people. They are here today. They have spent an
enormous amount of money with you and when we look at the things you are doing,
we wonder about our place in your view of the future. It doesn't seem as though we
have a place. We see you thinking about you and the consumer and we wonder
where we are in that. And it's like a lot of people in the industry see Google as an
existential threat, a clear-and-present danger to their business.
Yes. We are partnering with all of you. The world is changing and that was the
common theme across most of the talks yesterday and the day before. The travel
industry -- but the same is true for the broader industry that Google is in -- is in a
constant state of change and there is a constant amount of disruption going on. Like
a few years ago, who would've thought that Uber would disrupt the transportation
business or Airbnb would disrupt the hotel business the way that they have done it.
So actually probably the next disruption is someone sitting on that side of the stage.
And for Google as the broader search business that we are in as a tech company, we
are living in a world that has these kind of similar disruptions that are affecting us on
a day-to-day basis. And user behavior today is different. People have moved to
shorter and shorter moments. They are on their mobile phone all the time. They have
different expectations on what we need to provide them and if we at Google don't
move and provide them the answers as quickly as possible as they are looking for it,
then they will stop using Google and they will be using something else. (multiple
speakers).
A - Oliver Heckmann
A - Unidentified SpeakerI'm Travis Katz from a company called Gogobot and I wanted to talk about the user.
So one of the founding principles of Google is put the user first and all else will
follow and you talked about your goal with travel is to provide users with exactly
what they are looking for in the answers. But one of the core tenets of our economic
system is what users really want is choice and what's happening with Google is we
are seeing what you're doing is the travel product, which is beautiful by the way --
congratulations on all your work -- you are not giving users anymore choice of where
they get those answers from and a lot of people think that you are abusing your
monopoly in search to drive your things [ph].
So my question for you is, if the product is so good and if you really are providing
users the answers that they are looking for, why are you forcing your results to go
first in the search results as opposed to letting the core Google algorithm rank them
against other competitive sites?
We are not putting -- I'm not sure if you meant the hotel or the ﬂight product or both
of them. We are not putting anything up -- the ranking of our services in Google
search is strictly following what's good for the user and we measure all kind of
metrics for that. So we are not putting for example the hotel search results first if we
are not actually scientifically proving using all kind of metrics that that's the best
thing for the user looking at short clicks, long clicks and all kind of other stuff, side-
by-side comparisons, panels, retention and all kind of other metrics.
The product is much better. The world has changed. If I am searching for a hotel, to
stick with that example, 10 blue links are no longer going to cut it. And now uses are
also not searching for hotels in New York or in Florida, in Miami. The user is not
looking for another place where he can search for hotels. The user is trying to find
hotels in Miami and our experience is showing you directly much better than 10 blue
links where are on the map are the different hotels; what are the prices? This is fresh
information. And by the way. And that product that is on the screen right now, the
vast amount of the clicks from that product, it's an organic product. The vast amount
of clicks here is still organic, meaning unpaid traﬃc.
Ladies and gentlemen, Rod Cuthbert, Rome2rio; Elizabeth Harz, ADARA; and Oliver
Heckmann, Google.
