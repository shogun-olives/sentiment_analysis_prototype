Okay. Why don't we go ahead and get started?
First of all. Good morning. And Happy New Year to all of you. Welcome to
JPMorgan's 17th Annual Technology and Automotive Investor Forum here at the
Consumer Electronics Show on Las Vegas. My name is Harlan Sur. I'm the
semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment analyst here for the firm.
Pleased to have a solid day of semiconductor, automotive, automotive technology
and general tech companies presenting.
Also joining me from JPMorgan are my colleagues. I've got Bill Peterson who covers
the RF semiconductor value chain. We've got my colleagues Ryan Brinkman and
JosÃ© Asumendi, who cover the U.S. and European automotive sectors respectively;
Paul Coster, our applied and emerging technologies analyst; and Sumeet Chatterjee
who covers IT hardware and telecom and networking equipment.
So I hope you enjoy the conference. Thank you for participating. And remember, this
session is for you guys. So please ask questions.
And with that, I'm pleased to introduce Colette Kress, the Chief Financial Oﬃcer of
NVIDIA. It's been a tradition in the last few years to have the NVIDIA team kick off our
investor conference because the team is driving much of the trends, artificial
intelligence, deep learning, next-generation compute and automotive, next-
generation gaming, to name a few, all of these timely topics here at CES.
The team held their press conference on Sunday. I'll ask Colette to start us off with an
overview of what the team unveiled Sunday night. And then we'll go ahead and kick
off the Q&A.Colette M. KressSo Colette, thank you for joining us this morning.

Okay. Thank you for allowing us to kick off your conference. It's great to be here at
the Bellagio to help start off, in terms of CES. The team's already busy this morning.
But we've been here since Sunday.
We announced, in terms of our press conference that we had done on Sunday night,
it was our opportunity to continue our story of bringing Turing to many of our
different areas of growth. We started with Turing, focused in terms of both our
workstations as well as in our high-end gaming.
As you had seen us earlier last year, we had discussed Turing 2080 Ti, 2080, 2070, all
hitting in terms of key price points for the high-end types of gaming. This brought us
our opportunity here to announce and are very excited to announce that we brought
Turing, our 2060, to the mainstream overall gamers.
Our price point for here is essentially about $200 -- excuse me, $350. $350, which
we -- turn that this way, try that -- which uses an opportunity to see gamers all across
the world be able to appreciate, not only the next-generation Turing but probably
what is most important within there is ray tracing.
Now we have brought ray tracing to the market back in the fall, which is essentially
the holy grail of graphics. What we've done for so many years is simulate the ability
to do ray tracing. And now we are bringing it live, which allows you the ability to
address beams of light, rays of light, easier within the overall graphics, making them
truly as about as real as you can expect.
And this excitement has excited the entire ecosystem, the overall gaming industry,
everyone from the overall software developers that are bringing games as well as
bringing this even to the overall enterprise in terms of ray tracing. So our excitement
in terms of bringing in mainstream overall card to gaming was a very key highlight of
our offering on Sunday night.
With that, we've also introduced it with several bundles in terms of very key games
that are coming out, whether that be Anthem or Battlefield V. You can now get the
card with one or the other included in there. True excitement that this will be in terms
of a mainstream high volume for all across the world.
We're able to address many of the types of gamers that they have been -- purchased
the overall 970, that have purchased in terms of the overall 1060 or others or about
1/3 of our installed base who now have the ability to upgrade and use what we can
have with the overall 2060. So it was one of our very key announcements.
Additionally, we announced bringing Turing to our overall notebook or overall
mobility. There has been a trend over the last couple of years, as you had seen us,Q - Harlan Surbring out Max-Q. Max-Q was really associated with overall trend of thin and light
notebooks but also bringing the overall high performance that is necessary to do the
gaming with that.
Why should they have to choose between "I want premium light" or "I want high
performance"? We've been working for many years with the overall notebook OEMs
to now incorporate the performance levels that you also have in terms of on the
desktop.
So what you have coming out of the end of January is an astounding amount of
notebooks for overall gaming using Turing, probably more than 40 different ones.
They're all on display here at CES. So I strongly take -- there are some of the truly,
truly beautiful notebooks that are there and really just prime for that overall mobility
of gaming that is here.
Additionally, we announced with -- the overall G-SYNC. G-SYNC is our monitor frame
sync that we do as well. You've seen us with this in market where we have certified
many of the overall monitors to the overall GeForce card for many years. What we
are now doing is extending that to almost every single monitor that is out there. So
they will all be able to be G-SYNC available, just like we have in terms of those that
are just specific to our GeForce.
So this again brings excitement for all of the different gamers out there, that they can
have a super experience, whether they are mobile in terms of desktop in terms of
(there).
We've also announced some key things in terms of broadcast capabilities on how to
leverage the overall picture taking, which is so popular with inside the gamings and
broadcasting that as well.
So those were some of the great highlights that we did. We focused all of Sunday
night in terms of on gaming and additionally at our booth this week at the overall
conference. We do have automotive. And we will be on the ﬂoor with many of our
automotive partners as well.
Questions And Answers

Great. Now that was a great overview. And yes, it was actually very refreshing for the
first time in a while that the team focused on the core gaming platform. So that was
really good. And my follow-up question on that is, most of the discussion on the new
Turing architecture has been centered around Ray tracing capability. Obviously, it's a
key capability. But the thing that struck me is that Turing is also the first gaming
platform to actually bring artificial intelligence to graphics and gaming. And the
Tensor Core technology, combined with -- you've got an image-based neural
network called DLSS. And you can essentially use AI to improve the quality andA - Colette M. Kress
Q - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. Kressperformance of the gaming platform. So maybe help us understand how DLSS works
at a high level and how many of the upcoming games are actually going to support
this pretty neat feature.

Yes. So we are the first to bring to overall gaming the use of overall AI and so how
you want to think about this is in order to improve in performance, all about those
overall frame rates and how fast you can refresh. If we can take a simple example of
looking at a pixel over here and a pixel over here and inferring in between the 2,
based on what we see and what we know about the overall graphics, we can
increase both the overall quality of the overall picture as well as the overall speed
through that. That's what DLSS is. So there's many different pieces in terms of what
we are bringing in terms of Turing. One, overall just performance improvement in
terms of gaming overall. For games that you have today, games that you are using,
the overall improvement that you can see, more than 60x in many of the overall
cards that we can bring with Turing. Adding in terms of just DLSS what we may do
with some overall games also improves the overall performance as well as the
overall quality of the overall picture. Then the combination of ray tracing and DLSS
today would make a tremendous overall gift in terms of what they see in terms of
gaming. This is the next generation of gaming, the next generation of gaming that is
going to focus in terms of on ray tracing.

One of the statistics that Jensen threw out there on Sunday was that -- and you
mentioned this on the last earnings call as well, which is that 1/3 of your installed
base is on the GTX 960, 970, 1060 platforms, which is considered your midrange
platforms. And that's the area that the RTX -- the new RTX 2060 that you rolled out, is
targeting as well. And Jensen showed a significant performance step-up in the 2060
versus these prior generations, I guess, the implication being that given the
performance step-up, there is a lot of motivation to upgrade. And so my first
question to you, Colette, is 1/3 is midrange, what is the composition of the other 2/3
of the installed base looks like? Then second question is, historically when you've
had these big performance step-ups, like for example, 2060 versus prior generation,
how rapidly does the install base upgrade?

Sure. So what we have is when we think about our overall upgrade process, there's
definitely those that, at the moment a new architecture comes out, they are ready to
overall purchase an overall new card. So we have many of our top, top high-end
gamers that will literally buy the brand-new architecture on the day that it comes out
and sometimes even buy twice within the same architecture for multiple overall
gaming PCs that they may have. So what we have in terms of an explanation is yes,
we are addressing with a single overall Turing with the 2060. Essentially 1/3 of our
installed base that would be potentially looking at this is an opportunity for them to
use this as an upgrade. So what we have is not only those that were in Pascal and
focused in terms of on the 1060 -- but remember, at every architecture, we don't
upgrade every single person before we start the next architecture out there. So there
are many that are on the Maxwell. So when you think about the opportunity that youQ - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. Kressare on Maxwell, you are at 960, you are at 970 and you think about using a 2060,
that is a phenomenal overall performance improvement right after. And once they
have a 2060, they are also ready to address ray tracing and the overall content of ray
tracing going forward. So that's a great offering for a significant portion of our
installed base. And it will be interesting to see what they will overall do over that
period. But essentially, our installed base will be a combination of those that will be
on the older architecture. There will be those that have moved to the most recent
architecture and those that are the leading edge that have started in terms of Turing.
Turing is very new, started at the very, very high end. And we are now just getting
into the really -- the meat of the overall Turing by announcing the 2060 at this time.

Got it. Then on Max-Q, it's -- I think you can actually see it amongst the gaming
community, the adoption of these high-performance thin and light platforms. And
Jensen, I think, showed the number of parts being rolled out every year, for the last
couple of years, has gone up pretty dramatically. And so do you have a sense of the -
- of your -- of new GeForce or existing GeForce installed base? What percentage of
them are moving towards more of a kind of portable connected-in light notebook-
based platform?

Yes. I would say our overall notebook business, as we exited Q3 for our overall
gaming business, was up quite strongly, probably can be almost double the growth
rate in terms of what we're seeing in terms of the desktop. This is actually fueled by
the thin and light movement. And the excitement across the industry, both the OEMs
in terms of building them, the creativity that has gone in, as well as what they get in
terms of those notebooks, in terms of carrying all of that desktop experience to an
overall more mobile form factor. So it's still unclear to know exactly in terms of how
large our overall installed base of notebooks is but definitely, what we see is it's
probably one of the fastest-growing areas of our overall gaming business.

Yes. And I've seen like what, introductions from GIGABYTE, MSI, Asus, Acer. I think a
number of different -- have already started introducing the 20 series platforms in
their notebooks, right, just here at CES. Okay, that's great. Maybe turning to more of
sort of the near term. Based off of your Fourth Quarter, January quarter guidance,
NVIDIA is on pace to grow fiscal '19 revenues by 26% year-over-year. Obviously, the
Street has 6% growth for the overall company this coming fiscal year, fiscal year '20.
Obviously, part of that is the impact of the current channel inventory wind-down that
you discussed in the last call. The team discussed having a goal of having channel
inventories back to normal levels exiting the current quarter. You basically shut off
shipments of midrange GPU platforms into the channel, with the goal of working
down those inventories. So what kind of progress has the team made in reducing
channel inventories? And do you expect -- or when do you think you'll have a better
view on when you can start to ship to consumption?
Q - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. KressYes. So just to clarify where we ended at the end of Q3, it was our belief at the time,
at the end of Q3, is that the overall channel inventory for the midrange was still a
little high, a little high for us to continue, knowing that we would be moving to new
parts of the architecture to be continuing selling in. So we had a little bit of excess
channel inventory in our midrange Pascal at that time. We had pretty much penciled
in that we believed it would take us about 1 to 2 quarters to work through that
inventory. Then we would be back on track to continue in terms of what we have in
terms of our architecture with Turing. All things are progressing well. We believe that
we are on track to that overall estimate in terms of what we did. This gives us the
opportunity to seed and be in the great mindset for the next architecture of Turing
and the next generation as we took that pause to make sure that we could work
through that quite well.

As you monitor the health of the channel, pricing on some of these older midrange
cards have stabilized?

So the reason why we had reached the point of excess channel inventory was the
pricing was still a little bit too high, following overall cryptocurrency. That's a
different statement than in terms of, was there anything in terms of built too much or
otherwise? Really, what it was about was the overall pricing dynamics that were out
there in the channel. Keep in mind, our channel is a large channel. Our channel has
many layers into it. So what they had seen at the -- once supply started to equalize,
following a lot of the shortages that happened during overall cryptocurrency, the
overall pricing was quite high. It didn't come down as fast as we had thought it
would. And we were talking about a very important segment, which is price sensitive.
That price sensitivity and having too high prices caused us to have too much excess
demand at that -- excess supply at that time. So what our work has been, we have
seen those prices, what we would refer to as normalize, normalize in terms of what
we would say is manufacturers' suggested retail prices. And what you saw over the
holiday period was points of several overall promotions, whether done by the overall
channel or with help to essentially excite the overall community with that. Everything
from what we saw on Black Friday, Cyber Monday and that will also continue through
in terms of the Lunar New Year that finishes out our full holiday season.

Yes. And I would say that the number of AAA-rated blockbuster games, the number
of rollouts is actually quite healthy this year. So I would assume that just overall end
demand by your gaming community would have helped that. Your channel partners
now. And I assume, had visibility into the 2060 platform as well. And that might help
pricing on some of the older SKUs. But Jensen did say on the earnings call that the
target was to get to normalized channel inventories exiting this quarter. But...

So our (full) is we feel we'll be in a fairly good position. Essentially, you're never
going to be at 0 channel of inventory before we're actually moving to some of theQ - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. Kress
Q - Harlan Sur
Q - Unidentified Participant
A - Colette M. Kressnew things. So the normalization, correct, will be at that point. And -- but working
through the excess will be about 1 to 2.

1 to 2. Okay. Then postmortem, do you have a rough idea of how much sort of the
crypto portion of that accounted for as you look back at fiscal '19? And more
importantly, are there new monitoring systems or new product SKUs you can put in
place that's going to help the team keep a better, more real-time view on some of
these nongaming-related channels and sales on a go-forward basis?

Sure. So a lot of what we've seen in fiscal year '19 was obviously really great overall
gaming seasons and has continued for many years as the overall demand for
gaming as an entertainment industry is extremely high. But we were also introduced
with feeding the overall cryptocurrency, overall market, in the early parts of '19. Some
of that ended up changing at the end of our fiscal year '19 to where you could almost
normalize the full year is about what we see in terms of the overall gaming industry.
Our overall channel and our distribution is quite large, quite wide. We do the best
that we can in terms of getting information back. But in some regions of the world,
it's not as easy because there may be 3, 4 layers of overall distribution for us to get
real-time information back. We know that our overall GeForce experience is our
opportunity to have a connection with our overall gamers. But not -- again, we don't
see 100% of our gamers on that. But that gives us our best indication in terms of
what our gamers are using and how we can help them in terms of the future in
bringing products to market.

Before I jump into any other questions, I want to make sure if there's any questions in
the audience here. We have one right here. Do you want to wait for the -- do we
have a microphone? Yes. It's coming.
I guess, one question I had in terms of the inventory work down was, I think in the
past, you have used rebates in the channel as a way to help clear inventory. So I think
some analysts had been looking for that as a mechanism. And I don't think we've
seen that in the midrange yet. But I just kind of wanted to talk through how -- if
you're using a different system or if we've missed that. Then the other thing on the
gaming side is just how you have visibility on China in terms of that end demand
because that (is a) part of your installed base and there's so much volatility in that
market right now, just to get some added comfort there that you can see what
consumers there might be buying or not?

Sure. So let me address the first one. There's many different ways in terms of how we
are trying to work through the overall inventory. Bundling has been quite popular as
you have seen through the overall holiday seasons. From time to time, yes, we also
look in terms of rebates. But you have to be careful with that. In many times, that'sQ - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. Kressvery hard to get to because the overall inventory has probably already worked
through down the channel. So we don't have necessarily the direct contact as we do
with the initial part of our sale that we do to the AICs. But we do work from time to
time in terms of working through inventories. Those are generally some of the work
that we do to move the overall inventory. Your second question relates to the market
in terms of China. In terms of for gaming, we've pretty much indicated our installed
base and who we sell to for gaming, is probably about a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 model: 1/3
model in North America, another 1/3 in Europe and another 1/3 in the Asia Pac or
overall China area. We talk about the holiday season as a very important time of year
because it is a time where overall content for gaming comes out. And that is a great
opportunity to also think about the overall hardware improvements that you can
make at the same time as the overall software. It is the time to do things. But keep in
mind, the holiday season is broad and wide. Here in -- for example, in the U.S., I think
it starts close to the end of October and actually stems all the way through some
parts of overall January as we think about the after Christmas and some of that
overall purchasing. But we're still in the initial stages of working towards what we
would consider the holiday season in China, okay? In China, New Year doesn't
necessarily start until the beginning of February. So going back to our earlier
discussion, the 2060 Turing is a very, very important part for us as we knew moving
through our inventory and getting ready for Chinese New Year and that holiday.
we're extremely excited to be ready and positioned with our 2060 for the overall
holiday season in China.

Any other questions? Why don't we talk about the high-end enthusiast class
segment of your gaming business. You rolled out the 2070, 2080 Ti platform in the
second half of last year. I think the overall reviews were really good. I think what
we're waiting for and maybe what some of your enthusiast gamers are waiting for, is
for more titles to come out with the ray tracing capabilities, if you can give us an
update on that. And again, given that the AAA-rated gaming season and rollout of
new games was actually quite healthy, maybe just give us some sense of the
momentum for 27 -- 2070 and 2080 from a new product launch perspective.

Sure. Our branch of 2070, 2080 and 2080 Ti is a great set of overall high-end cards.
As we had talked about at the early stages, our 2080 Ti, the priced over $1,000 one,
was probably one of the most successful overall cards that we had in terms of it sold
out very, very quickly. But that still leaves our group of high-end cards well
positioned, both for existing games in terms of the overall performance
improvement. But this is definitely a lasting overall set of cards that will bring us
more overall content as we go forward. When you look at our overall presentation on
Sunday night in our press, we really talked about our overall engagement with the
ecosystem of the software developers. This is a part of our business that we know is
extremely important in terms of bringing this content, whether that be Anthem,
whether that be Battlefield V, whether that be a host of overall games that we will see
going in the future. We are very, very dedicated to it as well as they are. So I think
there's an important part that they also see the use of ray tracing as bringing
excitement to these overall games. So we see the conglomerate of this high end in
terms of a choice. In terms of where, we're still in the early stages of seeing this goQ - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. Kressthrough. But as a whole, we think this will lead to great game purchasing and also
buying into an architecture for the future.

We have our ﬂagship health care conference coming up. It's actually here -- it's this
weekend in San Francisco. And for the first time ever at a health conference, we
actually have a semiconductor company presenting at health care and it's NVIDIA.
And the head of your health care division is presenting. It's a great example of the
end market verticals that the team is trying to penetrate. So first of all, Colette, help
us understand how many vertical teams do you have, health care, industrial? And
how big are these in terms of the overall contribution to sort of company revenues?

Right. That's a great segue to talk about a lot of the work that we're doing in the data
center, the expansion of where we are on the data center, which is really, really,
industry and market specific. We chose a overall unified architecture as we take
things into the overall data center. But what we know is key is a lot of the work that
we are doing, whether it is accelerated computing or whether it is focused on AI, can
be very, very industry specific, rather than talking about just the pure hardware. So
we have continued to work on the overall software enablement with the overall right
hardware underneath to address many of these markets. You've highlighted that
we're coming in terms of health care. Wow, NVIDIA at health care. How can we see
ourselves in there? We've been a part of health care for many, many years. For
anybody going in, having any type of scan, any type of MRI, any of that, if you look
with those overall machines, those have incorporated NVIDIA for many years, one for
the overall speed that it can take to overall perform many of those scans but also the
detail, the amount of very specific in terms of what you can see. We are bar none top
of the line in any of that type of thing. But what you have found is as we see more
and more use in diagnostics, in terms of there, we can lead to prevent many of the
diseases that we see out there that are caught actually too late. If we could leverage
our overall capability by extracting data from all of these different form factors
around there to put together to say, I'm able to find something quite quickly in terms
of -- in an x-ray within a scan quite quickly. We can do miles of work in terms of what
it has taken in health care. So we have focused not only in terms of what the needs of
them from a hardware perspective but what they need from the overall software,
with a key goal in terms of speeding up the overall work and the early diagnosis.
That's what you will see in terms of -- at the overall health care. They'll talk broad and
wide. It's a very, very fascinating industry that has essentially been relatively
untouched, even though they have a significant amount of data that they're working
on. Now you've asked in terms of how many other industries are we doing this with.
We choose extremely carefully in terms of how many of these different industries are
we going to do. One, we look in terms of, is it a large market in front of us? Is this
something that is an enormous market that can benefit from redoing the overall
infrastructure of data that they have? Number two, is it a hard enough problem that
we know that this is something with our work, which we have the tenacity often to sit
through a very, very diﬃcult problem to put together, we think we can do. So we
have several of these continuing to be built. You saw us work on terms of that with
deep learning. You see us now moving in terms of overall machine learning. You've
seen us in the earliest, earliest days do high-performance computing. High-Q - Harlan Sur
A - Colette M. Kressperformance computing was a 10-year project to get to where we are. And now
we're probably -- the majority of everything that's in supercomputing that uses
(ASIC) acceleration. So we also have a focus in terms of -- a small focus in terms of
the robotics, we have the focus in terms of manufacturing, manufacturing in terms of
industries. You see the on-the-edge computing, which we think is extremely
important. So we're still in the early stages of that as well.

Great. Well Colette, thank you very much for joining us this morning.

So thank you.
