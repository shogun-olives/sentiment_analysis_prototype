Thank you. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very excited for
this opportunity to discuss with you our big launch today of the GeForce RTX Series
30-GPU family. On the call with us we have NVIDIA's CFO, Colette Kress; and our
SVP of Gaming, Jeff Fisher.
The format of today's call will be a short presentation followed by Q&A. You can find
a copy of the presentation as well as the replay of Jensen's virtual launch event from
earlier today on our Investor Relations website. And after the presentation, we'll
open it up for Q&A for either Jeff or Colette.Jeffrey D. FisherBefore we get started, I need to read a quick statement. During this call, we may

Okay. So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff, to kick us off.

Thanks, Simona. Welcome, everybody, thanks for joining us today on the call. So it's
been a very big day. It's really exciting, working up to our launch today. It is our first
virtual GeForce launch, kind of missed the live events, in-house with gamers. But this
was certainly a successful event regardless. And the team did an amazing job pulling
it all together. Everyone working at home, it was a new experience, but it was an
amazing production. The work was made even easier because we had a great story
to tell with Ampere. I hope you all enjoyed it. Let's get started.
I want to go through some of the highlights of the presentation today. You may have
all seen Jensen's key note, hopefully you did, but I want to go through some of the
key points in slides and then we'll get on to question and answer. In the wake of
COVID, it's evident that gaming has become a part of everyday life for billions of
people. Gaming connects people, it entertains, it tells stories, it's a sport and allows -
- that allows people to create or even become broadcasters of their own content.
GeForce PC gaming is large and thriving, it's open, it's scalable.
Games like Call of Duty and Fortnite have attracted hundreds of millions of gamers
and are now offering new experiences to participate, like the Travis Scott concert in
Fortnite earlier this summer, where almost 30 million people were participating and
watching in the game. 75% of GeForce gamers play Esports titles. Esports has an
audience of over 500 million people and it's a new competitive genre for most of a
brand-new generation of gamers.
Gaming has also opened up a new world for creators who can modify games, create
their own stories, using game assets to share with their friends, a whole new medium
for creation. With PC Gamers, anyone can broadcast their gameplay with PC -- with a
gaming PC, anyone can broadcast their gameplay like a pro, to a wide audience or
just to a few friends. Today, there is over 20 million streamers globally.
So let's talk about the product. NVIDIA RTX is not just the GPU, it is a full stack. It
starts with the new GPU architecture -- our new GPU architecture, which is RTX. On
top of RTX, the device, it includes new engine tech for games and for creative apps,
and a bunch of new rendering algorithms that are invented by NVIDIA research
team.All the major 3D APIs have extended to include RTX. RTX is supported by all major
3D creation tools. RTX Tech is incorporated in all major game engines. There are
hundreds of games being developed with RTX Tech and there has been thousands
of research papers written about it.
We started designing the RTX architecture over 10 years ago to address limitations
that we saw coming in traditional rasterization technology. The RTX GPU has three
dedicated processors, the programmable Shader which we designed over 10 years
ago, a revolution in graphics in and of itself, and RT Core to accelerate ray tracing,
and the Tensor Core, which is an AI processing pipeline. The Tensor Core powers our
graphics AI technology, DLSS, which delivers high performance and image quality in
games and is now viewed as critical to deliver high performance ray trace gaming.
RT and DLSS are in a majority of the new generation of games.
Let me start by showing you how the three dedicated cores work concurrently. First,
Shader, this is an example of a single ray trace frame of the game Wolfenstein:
Youngblood, so it's one frame. The Shader could do all the work of ray tracing and
rasterizing. Some architectures may attempt to do this, even Pascal was capable of
ray tracing but the perf is bad. This is 51 milliseconds of just using Shader to ray trace
a Wolfenstein frame, 20 millisecond -- 51 milliseconds is less than 20 frames per
second. The game will be virtually unplayable. Adding RT Cores gets you 20
milliseconds per frame. RT Core (inaudible) concurrently with Shaders. But 20
milliseconds is still not 60 frames per second. That is where AI comes in, adding our
Tensor cores and DLSS, you are now gaming well above 60 frames per second at 12
milliseconds per frame.
It's all about three dedicated cores capable of concurrent operation to deliver high
performance ray traced gaming.
Now we get on to Ampere, our second-generation RTX architecture. Ampere has a
new Shader, at 30 Teraﬂops, it is 2.7x turns performance. It has our second Gen RT
Core. At 58 Teraﬂops, it is 1.7x the performance of turing and ray tracing. And it
includes our third-generation Tensor Core with 238 Tensor Teraﬂops for AI and DLSS.
In all, the three cores deliver 2x perf, three cores, 2x perf. This is our triple double.
So today, in Jensen's kitchen, we introduced Ampere, our new GPU. It's 28 billion
transistors, 28 billion. It's in Samsung's 8N Custom Process, connected to the world's
fastest memory G6X and delivers 2x perf Gen to Gen. Ampere powered on in our
labs this last May and is now in volume production. It has been an amazing execution
by the team, proud to be a part of the -- proud to watch in times of COVID, just
amazing execution.
Full stack engineering and craftsmanship is the heart of all of our GPUs and Ampere
is no exception. The goal to squeeze every drop of perf and power eﬃciency up and
down the stack. Ampere delivers 1.9x more power eﬃciency in turing. This extends
our ability to operate in low-power systems and scale higher performance with
power.So today, we announced our new ﬂagship GPU, the RTX 3080. At $699, it has 10
gigabytes of the world's fastest memory. It's a generational leap, it is super important
when launching a new GPU. This inspires developers to push realism on a much
larger footprint, and of course, for gamers, to upgrade. The 3080 is available
September 17.
As you know, our first Gen RTX turned, while groundbreaking and setting the stage
for a revolution in graphics and gaming, did not quite achieve this Gen to Gen perf
over Pascal. 3080, our second-gen RTX and designed in Samsung's 8N, is designed
to deliver amazing perf for current and next-generation games and inspire gamers
that now is the time to upgrade.
This chart shows a 3080 at $699 stacked above 980, 1080 Ti and 2080 Super, and
delivers roughly 2x the Perf of our 2080 that was launched just two years ago.
The second GPU we announced is the RTX 3070. The 70s are some of our most
important products. The 3070 is priced starting at $499 and will be available in
October. It has 8 gigabytes of G6 memory. The 3070 at $499 is faster than our 2080
Ti, incredible value. Once again, the 3070 is designed to inspire developers and
gamers alike, delivering great perf over turing and a clear choice for gamers to
upgrade.
Finally, we launched a big ferocious GPU, what we affectionately call the BFGPU, our
3090. Realizing that our Titan class products were in high demand, enthusiast
creators and researchers were using it to power their gaming rigs and workstations,
we decided to add a 90 class this cycle, our first ever, at the top of the GeForce stack
and to sell it through our worldwide AIC channels. It is a beast of the GPU and it's
priced starting at $1,499. It is the first GPU that will support 8-K 60 frames per second
and with ray tracing on. The 3090 will be available from partners at the end of the
month, starting September 24.
So all in all, the key note covered a lot of material. NVIDIA delivers the greatest ever
generational leap with their 30 series GPUs. Ampere is more than a chip. It's a stack
that powers the top game engines and creator apps. Ampere is our second-
generation RTX arch, well ahead of the industry, leading the industry, with three
dedicated cores that is delivering 2x the perf and power eﬃciency. Three cores, 2x,
once again, our triple-double.
We also delivered new tools for the infinite ways that gaming is expanding. As noted,
gamers are not just gamers anymore, they're creators, they're competitors, they
connect socially all important elements of gaming, and the GeForce platform
continues to deliver. This is for the tens of millions of streamers, broadcasters,
Esports pros, artists and creators.
We did this with our new applications for Esports NVIDIA Reﬂex, delivering low
latency gaming for the millions of Esports gamers, NVIDIA Broadcast for the millions
of GeForce broadcasters who are streaming their games. And finally, NVIDIASimona Jankowski

Simona JankowskiOmniverse Machinima allowing gamers and creators to take in-game assets
combined with their web camera and other visual effects libraries to create cinematic
film quality storytelling from game assets. This will be -- we believe Machinima will
truly be groundbreaking.
So thank you all for your time today. Hopefully we covered everything, although
there is one more point I want to make. Sorry. Finally, RTX is on and this is probably
one of the most important things. When we launched RTX, we wanted to inspire
developers. RTX real-time ray tracing is now coming to Fortnite. With both Minecraft
and Fortnite onboard, the number one and two most played games in the world RTX
on, adding the most anticipated titles this fall, Cyberpunk, Call of Duty, Black Ops
and Watch Dogs, there is no question that RT is the new standard for games.
Okay, with that, I wanted to say, thank you all for your attention and we can open it
up for questions. Simona?

Yeah, thank you very much, Jeff. And operator, let's open up the line for any
questions.
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Vivek Arya from BofA
Securities.

Hello, Jeff and Colette, it's Vivek Arya. Congrats on the launch and thanks for letting
me ask a question. I actually had two, one for Jeff and one for Colette. Jeff, how large
do you estimate your deployed base of gamers is, and how do you see this upgrade
cycle playing out versus what you saw with versus what you saw with Turing and
Pascal, and do you think this is more of a unit or ASP-driven cycle?
And if I could just also squeeze in my question for Colette at the same time. Colette,
you mentioned working with Samsung for this new product launch and I'm
wondering how do you think about just kind of the cost and benefit of working with
two different foundries for your Ampere set of products? Thank you.

Should I start?

Yeah, go ahead, Jeff, why don't you start first?
