Doug McMillonThank you, and good morning, everyone. It's my honor as Chair of the Walmart
Board of Directors to welcome you to our 53rd Annual Shareholders' Meeting. We
appreciate you joining us today. We've had a strong year and we're encouraged by
the response from customers and members. Around the world, we know they're
feeling the pressure from inﬂation and we're working hard to help them stretch their
dollar further.
We're set up to deliver for any customer or member in our stores, clubs, and online,
whether they've shopped with us for years or they're trying us for the first time.
We're in a unique position in our history. We're leveraging today's advancements
and innovations and growing fast, but with all the wisdom that comes with age. I'm
confident that we have the right associates, the right leaders, and the right strategy
to sustain this momentum.
All the nominees standing for election to our Board of Directors have joined our
virtual meeting. Also joining online are representatives from Ernst & Young,
Walmart's independent accountants. The Inspectors of Election today are from
Broadridge Financial Solutions. Based on their report, majority of the shareholders
entitled to participate in the meeting are represented online.
We have a quorum and may proceed with the business portion of the meeting.
Therefore, our meeting is oﬃcially called to order. It is now 10:32 a.m. The polls are
open and will close after the presentation of the last shareholder proposal.
Only shareholders who held shares as of the record date for this meeting are
entitled to vote shares. If you have already voted your shares, there is no need to
vote again unless you wish to change your vote. If you would like to vote your shares
or change your vote, you may do so while the polls are open by following the
instructions on your screen.
Now, I would like to acknowledge the director nominees, including myself who are
up for re-election this year. They are Cesar Conde, Tim Flynn, Sarah Friar, Carla
Harris, Tom Horton, Marissa Mayer, Doug McMillon, Randall Stephenson, Rob
Walton, and Steuart Walton. Thank you all for your willingness to continue to serve
our company.
Next, I have asked Walmart President and CEO, Doug McMillon, to share an update
on the company's priorities. Then, Rachel Brand, our Corporate Secretary, will take us
through the formal business of the meeting. Doug?

Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for your interest in our company.
As we look back at last year and the past few years, we've driven strong performance
and made a lot of progress delivering our strategy at the same time. We have a
strong team of associates, very capable leaders, and a compelling set of assets and
capabilities that enable us to continue delivering for customers and members
whenever and however they want to be served in that moment. While we've had a
lot of change to make that possible, we've stayed true to our purpose and values.
Here's how we describe today's Walmart. We're a people-led, tech-powered,
omnichannel retailer dedicated to helping people save money and live better. We
know who we are, we like who we are, and we like who we're becoming. For fiscal
'23, we added $38 billion in revenue, and we crossed $600 billion for the first time in
our company's history. We drove strong results in the first quarter, and we're well-
positioned for the rest of the year. Our price position is strong, our assortment is
growing, and we're improving the experience for our customers and members.
Globally, e-commerce represented more than $80 billion in sales last year. During
the first quarter of this year, around 15% of our total sales began in a digital fashion.
Customers and members have the ﬂexibility to shop however they want and choose
from hundreds of millions of items. In the United States, we're almost as known
today for our convenience as we are for our low prices.
More than ever, we're powered by technology. Our customers and members engage
us through our apps and sites, and our associates have information and capabilities
at their fingertips. We're able to create a true omnichannel experience, unlike any
other retailer, with over 10,500 stores, Sam's Clubs, and scaled e-commerce
businesses around the world. Our business model is also being shaped by the work
we're doing to scale newer, mutually-reinforcing businesses like marketplace,
fulfillment services, and advertising. Our ability to serve people how they want to be
served has driven a compounded annual sales growth rate of 6% over the last five
years, excluding divestitures.
Today's Walmart is a team of 2.1 million associates who are united by our purpose,
values, and culture. We're a place of opportunity, where associates' voices are heard
and associate feedback has been foundational to our company's success. We work
to create a path of opportunity for everyone who wants a career at Walmart, more
than just a job. Our goal is to keep and develop people. We continue to support and
invest in our associates through their wages, benefits, including healthcare, and ways
to invest and save for retirement, by making it easier to gain a college degree or
certificate through our Live Better U program where our company pays for tuition
and books.
We know that our long-term success will depend on how we create advancement
and growth opportunities for our associates. In the U.S., we are recently certified as a
Great Place to Work by the industry leader in workplace excellence. Our work
extends into the communities we serve. By creating more opportunities for the
people who live there, we'll end up with a stronger business. We're also making
progress to strengthen our planet. Project Gigaton is one example, and we're now
three-quarters of the way toward our goal to reduce or avoid 1 billion metric tons of
greenhouse gases by 2030.
Rachel Brand
Christopher CoxThe long-term strength of our business and how we deliver for shareholders will
depend on how we serve customers, associates, suppliers, communities, and the
planet. It requires healthy relationships, trust, and leadership. Thank you again for
your interest in our company.
Now, I'll turn it over to Rachel Brand, our Corporate Secretary. She'll take us through
the presentation of the proposals.

Thank you, Doug. As we have done in previous shareholder meetings, we will begin
with formal business and move on to a Q&A session after the meeting adjourns. The
Rules of Conduct for the meeting are available on the Virtual Meeting site. Under
those rules, each person presenting a shareholder proposal will have three minutes
to speak. 13 items will be presented for a vote today. The first four items are the
company proposals. They appear in the Proxy Statement as Proposals 1 through 4.
The first is the election of 11 directors. Information about each director nominee can
be found in the Proxy Statement. The second proposal is a non-binding advisory
vote on the frequency of future say-on-pay votes. The vote on this proposal is
advisory, but the Board will consider the results in evaluating how often future say-
on-pay votes should occur. The third proposal is a non-binding advisory vote to
approve the compensation of Walmart's named executive oﬃcers. The vote on this
proposal is advisory, but the Board will consider the results in evaluating our
executive compensation program. The fourth proposal is to ratify the appointment of
Ernst & Young as the company's independent accountants for the fiscal year ending
January 31, 2024.
Now we'll move on to the shareholder proposals. The company's response to each
one can be found in the Proxy Statement. The first shareholder proposal appeared as
Number 5 in the Proxy Statement. It was submitted by the Franciscan Sisters of
Perpetual Adoration and various co-filers. Christopher Cox pre-recorded his
presentation, which we will now play.

Thank you, Ms.Brand, and good morning, Mr.McMillon, members of the Board, and
fellow shareholders. My name is Christopher Cox, and on behalf of the Franciscan
Sisters of Perpetual Adoration who are members of the Interfaith Center on
Corporate Responsibility, along with our co-filers, I present shareholder Proposal
Number 5, which asks our Board for the adoption of a policy that recommends the
Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors
to take into consideration the pay grades and/or salary ranges of all classifications of
Walmart employees when setting target amounts for Chief Executive Oﬃcer
compensation.
Walmart is the largest private sector employer with 2.3 million employees. And we
see gaps in our company's practices and policies. What are those gaps? Our
Rachel Brand
Gina Cummingscompany's Compensation and Management Development Committee does not
suﬃciently consider the company's overall compensation philosophy for all
employees as part of the CEO compensation process. For instance, in our company -
- our company relies on peer group benchmarking to set target CEO pay amounts,
which can lead to employee inﬂation. And then that leads us to a situation where we
ask the question, how do we compare to other peers?
Walmart's 2021 pay ratio was 1,013 to 1 versus the consumer staple sector average
pay ratio of 206 to 1. And what are the financial implications and impact of this issue
on shareholder value? Well, high CEO to worker pay ratios can erode employee
morale and productivity and lead to increased turnover. Considering how other
employees are paid at the company, will encourage the Committee to consider what
quantum of CEO pay is appropriate for the company's own needs.
The company's opposition statement in the proxy places in bold print that quote,
Walmart has made significant investments in its frontline hourly associates, and
frontline hourly associate compensation has risen far faster than CEO compensation
over the same period. While that is right and that is due, we believe that evaluating
pay grades for all employees when determining CEO compensation would help
demonstrate Walmart's commitment to supporting its associates and help mitigate
risks associated with growing CEO worker pay gaps.
We therefore, urge shareholders to vote for Proposal Number 5.

Thank you, Mr.Cox. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal for the
reasons explained in the Proxy Statement.
The next proposal appeared as Number 6 in the Proxy Statement. It was submitted
by Oxfam America Incorporated and various co-filers. Gina Cummings pre-recorded
her presentation, which we will now play.
Good morning. My name is Gina Cummings, Vice President at Oxfam America. I'm
here to present ballot Proposal Number 6 on behalf of Oxfam America and co-filers.
Our proposal calls on Walmart to report on their Human Rights Due Diligence, or
HRDD, to identify, assess, prevent, and mitigate human rights risks in both the
company's supply chain and own operations.
In my 16 years with the organization, this is the first time I presented a shareholder
resolution. But on the heels of the U.S. child migrant labor scandal that came to light
earlier this year, in which the New York Times reported that migrant child laborers
were working for Walmart suppliers here in the U.S., the issue has become so critical
that I felt compelled to get involved.
Rachel Brand
Unidentified SpeakerBe assured, we don't take this matter lightly. This is the first resolution we filed with
Walmart in the five years that we've been actively engaging with the company. It is
because the company has failed to adopt policies and practices that demonstrate
suﬃciently robust and effective HRDD in line with investor expectations that we felt
compelled to file. After all, workers' rights are human rights.
Media reports threaten to jeopardize Walmart's reputation and are likely to generate
negative public perception around poor working conditions for workers in both the
company's global supply chains and own workforce. Human rights violations,
including forced labor, inhumane conditions, and low pay, continue to plague
sectors like the seafood industry, which Walmart sources from in huge numbers.
Here in the U.S., the company has also been accused of retaliation against
employees for taking sick time during the COVID-19 pandemic and failing to
accommodate pregnant employees, among other things.
To mitigate these risks and protect medium and long-term shareholder value,
conscientious companies conduct HRDD in line with the UN Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights. HRDD is a low-cost means of detecting emerging
human rights risks and providing redress for harms, which in turn allows a company
to protect itself against expensive fines and burn its reputation. Yet even Walmart's
most recent human rights' disclosures published just last month in April 2023 still
failed to make suﬃcient concrete commitments in line with the company's
recognized HRDD responsibilities.
Walmart continues to overly rely on social compliant audits, which are notoriously
ﬂawed and fail to identify human rights risks in place of HRDD tools. Ultimately,
unless and until Walmart is able to disclose the results of its HRDD process and the
concrete steps it is taking to mitigate the human rights concerns the company has
identified within its operations and supply chains, there will remain significant
potential risks to investors.
We urge investors to support Proposal 6. Thank you for your time.

Thank you, Ms.Cummings. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal for
the reasons explained in the Proxy Statement.
The next proposal appeared as Number 7 in the Proxy Statement. It was submitted
by organization United for Respect, and various co-filers. TaNeka Hightower pre-
recorded her presentation, which we will now play.
My name is TaNeka Hightower, and I've worked at Walmart for over five years with
several different job titles. In that time with my experiences, I've learned a lot about
Walmart, which has led me to advocate for this proposal on behalf of the thousands
of other Walmart associates of color.
Rachel Brand
Scott ShepardThe resolved clause of this proposal reads as follows. RESOLVED: Shareholders
request Walmart Incorporation conduct a third-party independent racial equity audit
analyzing Walmart's adverse impact on black, indigenous, and people of color
communities and to provide recommendations for improving the company's racial
equity impact.
This year, Walmart received an F rating on the 2023 Racial and Gender Pay
Scorecard from Arjuna Capital and Proxy Impact, which implicates there are
profound inequalities among minority demographics at the company. As a Walmart
associate, I've seen the disparity firsthand and I am not alone. Being an African-
American woman with more than 15 years of retail experience, I find it extremely
diﬃcult to advance within Walmart. Over the course of my five years at this
corporation, I see less and less people who look like me.
For decades, Walmart, run by America's richest family, has been accused of
exploiting black workers like me via pay inequality, lack of diversity in management
and in the Boardroom, and meaningless virtue signaling. We're fed up. And that's
why United for Respect has filed a shareholder resolution at Walmart calling for a full
racial equity audit.
Walmart doesn't disclose hourly pay gaps by race and we are asking them to do so.
Racial equity audits are quickly becoming an industry standard as multinational
companies such as Facebook, Apple, Airbnb, and Starbucks have agreed to analyze
their impact on their workers of color. Walmart should do the same.
Presently, people of color comprise 49% of Walmart's total U.S. workforce, but only
27% of its oﬃcers and only 18% of its Board Directors. We make up the majority of
Walmart's workforce. It is time for Walmart's leadership to identify, prioritize, remedy,
and reverse the corporation's negative impacts on people and communities of color.
And that's why I am urging you to vote for Proposal 7. Thank you.

Thank you, Ms.Hightower. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal for
the reasons explained in the Proxy Statement.
The next proposal appeared as Number 8 in the Proxy Statement. It was submitted
by the National Center for Public Policy Research. Scott Shepard pre-recorded his
presentation, which we will now play.

The company's opposition to our proposal points to a lot of paper barriers against
discrimination, but it does not deny the fact, as established in our proposal, that it
provides relevant managers and executives a dashboard breaking down the race,
ethnicity, and sex of the employees under their charge, and then encourages them
Rachel Brandto increase the number of favored diverse groups who get hired and promoted,
necessarily at the expense of those groups that the company does not honor with
the label diverse.
Many other companies that follow this exact path have a third prong to their covert
discrimination program. They pay the relevant executives and managers more if they
hit race, ethnicity, and sex-based employment targets. Does Walmart do that too?
Company must come clean.
Giving employees with personnel power all the information they need to
discriminate on illegal grounds, encouraging them to get their numbers up on those
illegal grounds, and then paying them more if they somehow hit those goals, how is
that not illegal discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, and sex?
Of course, it is illegal discrimination on those bases. As Walmart has enthusiastically
committed to providing tools and incentives for breaking the law, it now has an
aﬃrmative duty to demonstrate that despite those inducements to illegality, it
nevertheless is not breaking the law. One way to do that would be to publish the
demographic statistics of its layoffs for shareholders and the public to see, to reveal
whether Walmart's incentives to discriminate are working as intended.
The company says in its opposition that the requested report would not enhance
transparency, but that's self-evidently false. The report would provide exactly the
information it asked for, information that the company already collects and shares
internally with its dashboard, but for some reason really does not want to share with
shareholders and the public.
Given the totality of the circumstances, the most reasonable inference to draw from
the company's unwillingness to provide this additional information is that these new
incentives to discriminate are successfully causing the incentivized illegal
discrimination. After all, again, what are these dashboards for if not to allow relevant
employees to manipulate the race, sex, and ethnicity composition of the employees
who report to them? What are the encouragements to reach certain demographic
goals meant to do, but to cause the employees to do whatever they need to, to get
to those goals. And if they get paid more to hit the goals, isn't that pretty much the
case closed?
It sure looks like a jerry-rigged system designed to force Walmart employees to
discriminate in illegal ways against other Walmart employees and to personally
shoulder the legal risk for such discrimination, while the C-suite innocently points to
paper protections that this whole system is designed to violate. I wish there were
some other interpretation because this one's appalling, but I sure can't think of one.
Walmart's discriminatory hiring and promotion scheme must be monitored carefully.
Reporting demographic layoff statistics is just a tiny first step. Thank you.

Analyst
Rachel BrandThank you, Mr.Shepard. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal for the
reasons explained in the Proxy Statement.
The next proposal appeared as Number 9 in the Proxy Statement. It was submitted
by James McRitchie. Mr.McRitchie pre-recorded his presentation, which we will now
play.
Hello, this is James McRitchie. In 2002, I petitioned the SEC for proxy access. It took
three rulemakings and a court battle. 20 years later, 81% of S&P 500 companies,
including Walmart, have something they call proxy access. Unfortunately, nominating
groups must hold 3% for 3 years and are limited to 20 members.
Proxy access can't really be done without one of the big four fund families, and they
won't vote to increase the group size, since they often hold 3% themselves. They
administer retirement savings plans for companies and have never filed a
shareholder proposal, let alone challenge directors. So proxy access has gone
unused.
Now after decades, the SEC has adopted Rule 14a-19, allowing shareholders under
specified conditions to split our votes between Board nominees and challengers
without attending the Annual Meeting. Will the universal proxy rule go the way of
proxy access?
After reading bylaws adopted by Mossimo, Bloomberg's Matt Levine speculated that
company bylaws might soon demand challengers submit disclosures on paper
woven from unicorn manes, with requirements waived for the Board's nominees.
Most agree there should be some limits on what Boards can require without seeking
shareholder approval in advance or within a year of adoption.
I filed 30 proposals like the one before you now, and negotiated agreements with
1/3 of the companies based on guardrails that preserve the SEC's intent. All
shareholder proposals are advisory. Even if we win overwhelmingly, Boards are free
to do whatever they please. But higher votes do provide a better negotiating
position.
Your vote for this proposal could help us reach a similar agreement at Walmart,
either before the next meeting or after, and even higher vote next year based on a
revised proposal that reﬂects agreements reached with other companies to protect
the rights of shareholders. Please vote for proposal Number 9. Thank you.

Thank you, Mr.McRitchie. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal for the
reasons explained in the Proxy Statement.
Julie Kalish
Rachel BrandThe next proposal appeared as Number 10 in the Proxy Statement. It was submitted
by Clean Yield Asset Management on behalf of Julie Kalish. Ms.Kalish pre-recorded
her presentation, which we will now play.
Good morning, Mr.Chair, Board of Directors, and fellow shareholders. My name is
Julie Kalish, and I am the filer of this proposal. The proposal asks Walmart to issue a
report detailing the potential risks and costs to the company of fulfilling law
enforcement requests for information that could be used in abortion-related
prosecutions. We also ask Walmart to articulate strategies that might minimize such
risks.
In states that have banned abortion, law enforcement has relied on consumer data to
investigate and prosecute both individuals who have sought abortions and those
who have helped them. This is expected to continue. Law enforcement can easily
request access to digital reproductive health footprints that can lead to criminal or
civil charges.
In a well-known case, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, complied with a data
request from a Nebraska Police Department to hand over private Facebook
messages sent between a mother and a daughter. Both were then charged with
felonies related to the alleged illegal termination of the daughter's pregnancy. This is
just one example.
As the country's largest retailer, Walmart amasses large troves of consumer data. It
has access to customers' transactional data, demographic information, pharmacy
purchases, and website browsing history. Given the sensitive nature of this data,
Walmart will be especially vulnerable to law enforcement data requests related to
abortion.
But we don't know what if any measures Walmart would take to protect the privacy
of its customers' sensitive reproductive health data. We also don't know if Walmart
sells or shares this information for profit to data brokers. As investors, we don't want
to see Walmart implicated in betrayals of consumers' privacy.
Implementing the requested report will assure investors that Walmart has thought
through its data handling practices in light of current and future changes to both
technology and the law. Failure to do so risks diminishing the company's brand
reputation and consumer loyalty, and eroding shareholder value.
If you have not yet cast your vote, I urge you to vote yes on Item Number 10. Thank
you so much for your attention.

Paul ChesserThank you, Ms.Kalish. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal for the
reasons explained in the Proxy Statement.
The next proposal appeared as Number 11 in the Proxy Statement. It was submitted
by the National Legal and Policy Center. Paul Chesser will present it on behalf of the
shareholder proponent. Mr.Chesser pre-recorded his presentation, which we will
now play.
Walmart keeps it short in opposing our proposal, which asked the company to
produce an Annual Report on the extent of the risks it faces by the large amount of
business it does in communist China. The company claims they've got it covered,
that there's nothing to see here, so shareholders can just move along. Walmart
claims this by pointing out three measures that they've taken.
One, Walmart claims that shareholders are suﬃciently informed about material risks
in periodic reports to the SEC. But this is just laughable as there is zero detail about
the extensive risk of doing business in China. Two, Walmart claims it addresses the
risks we're asking about through its enterprise risk management program. This
sounds like a perfectly bureaucratic process of questionable value and it certainly is
opaque for shareholders. Three, Walmart says it is, quote, committed to respecting
human rights and has established robust due diligence processes to manage human
rights risk, end quote.
In making this claim, the company points to its ESG brief on human rights and to its
human rights statement on its website. But after reviewing these two statements, it's
interesting that I found mentions about Walmart's scrutiny of human rights in other
countries, but not in China. For example, Walmart mentions in these statements how
it focuses on supply chains for apparel in Bangladesh, produce in the U.S. and
Mexico, shrimp and tuna in Thailand, and electronics sourced for the U.S. market.
Walmart also notes concerns it has about migrant labor in Malaysia and its supply
chains in Central America and India. But when it comes to human rights, there's
pretty much no mention of China. Why is that? At a company like Walmart, whose
reputation is in many ways known, oh, there's a few mentions of China on Walmart's
website with regard to other issues. Those ESG issues would be climate change,
biodiversity, protecting forests, and foodborne illness.
Communist China has been credibly accused by the U.S. State Department of
censorship, political imprisonment, forced labor, torture, organ harvesting, genocide,
threatening its neighbors, and many other atrocities. None of these are worth a
mention on any of Walmart's disclosures, while other lesser offending countries are
mentioned.
Walmart has big plans for growth in China with the country representing 13% of
revenue growth compared to 7.3% for the rest of the company in the most recent
quarter. And Walmart has said it plans to invest $1.2 billion in logistics and
Rachel Brand
Unidentified Speakerdistribution in China over the next 10 to 20 years. Needless to say, in light of what we
do know about communist China and its tyrannical practices, Walmart's so-called
disclosures are insuﬃcient in light of its plans.
Please vote for Proposal Number 11.

Thank you, Mr.Chesser. The Board recommends a vote against this proposal for the
reasons explained in the Proxy Statement.
We will now move on to the final shareholder proposal appearing in the Proxy
Statement, which appeared as Number 12. It was submitted by Cynthia Murray and a
co-filer. Ms.Murray pre-recorded her conversation for conversation, which we will
now play.
My name is Cynthia Murray, and I've worked at Walmart for over 22 years, and I am a
Co-Founder of United for Respect. Every person deserves to be safe at work, and
every employer has an obligation to implement reasonable safety measures to
protect employees and customers from harm. This is especially true in public-facing
positions that come with obvious risks: exposure to illness, violence, physical harm,
and mental stress.
For a company like Walmart, owned by one of the richest families in the world, the
failure to invest in employees' safety sends a clear message to associates. Our lives
are not assets worth protecting. After what happened in Chesapeake, Virginia, I had
enough. I was scared for myself and other associates, and wanted to force Walmart
to take action that hopefully will make stores safer. The shooter was a team lead. I
think it's important to understand how that job puts people in extremely stressful
situations. Team leads have responsibilities that used to be for multiple people, and
they are not salary managers.
Walmart is a billion-dollar company. Yet the company dropped the ball during
COVID. Workers were bringing in their own gloves and masks. Walmart wasn't
providing them. But Walmart is unsafe in other ways too. Understaﬃng is a big issue,
and it forces us to do more work, oftentimes too quickly to be safe. What happened
to Janikka Perry is an example of how Walmart treats employees. She died after
collapsing on the bathroom ﬂoor of her store and was there for two hours before
anyone helped her.
Walmart associates also suffer from a serious occupational hazard, gun violence. Just
two months after the Chesapeake shooting, there was a separate attack, this time at
a store in Indiana. These are not isolated tragedies. Between January 2020 and
November 2022, there was at least 363 gun incidents and 112 gun deaths at Walmart
locations across the country. Walmart associates are still haunted by the horrific
Rachel Brand
Analystmemory of the 2019 mass shooting motivated by racism and hate, that took the lives
of 23 people at a store in El Paso, Texas.
As a 22-year Walmart Associate, I am personally invested in keeping myself and my
fellow associates safe at work. I ask my fellow shareholders to vote yes for Proposal
12.

Thank you, Ms.Murray. We do not agree with the facts that have been presented. The
health and safety of our customers and associates is our greatest priority, and we
remain focused on taking steps that help us continue to build a safe workplace and
shopping experience for all. We do not believe the requested report would aid
Walmart in upholding our commitments and encourage a vote against their
proposal.
Lastly, as noted in the Other Matters section of our Proxy Statement, Mr.Jorgen
Harmse has submitted a proposal under the Advanced Notice provision of Walmart's
bylaws. This provision of our bylaws creates a process for a shareholder to present a
proposal that was not published in the Proxy Statement. Mr.Harmse is permitted
three minutes to present his proposal at the meeting today.
Shareholders should vote for or against Proposal 13 in the Ask a Question box. All
votes will be counted by the Inspectors of Election with regard to this proposal.
Please refresh your browser as needed to vote.
Mr.Harmse pre-recorded his presentation, which we will now play.
Thank you, Madam Secretary. My proposal is to prevent WALPAC from funding
politicians who oppose democracy and the rule of law. Most of the examples in the
proposal voted against certification of the 2020 election and against holding Trump
to account for attacking the Capitol. I also put in a few state-level leaders in voter
suppression.
The moral reasons are clear. Our system of government is still threatened by fascism,
and future insurrectionists are watching. The leader for whom the fraud was
attempted is corrupt, cruel, and incompetent. No real patriot wants any of these
individuals in government.
Do not tell me that this is political. Walmart has a Political Action Committee. We can
support neocons, social conservatives, progressives, corporatists, and everyone in
between. We must not support those who want to abolish politics and overthrow the
whole system. Doing so is bad for Walmart's image, and if we're not supporting
them, we should make it clear by passing my resolution. PR should not be the
reason, but we'll take credit where we can.
Rachel Brand
OperatorSam Walton said that we must be agents for our customers. And who are Walmart's
customers? They are the very people whom extremists want to disenfranchise,
whether by closing polling stations, by finding 11,780 votes, or by killing the Vice
President. Associates come from the same demographics. So I have a challenge for
the Executive leadership team. Whenever you visit a store or club, look the workers
in the eye and explain what you did today.
Hang Mike Pence, remember that if you are ever tempted to make a deal. However
much you have done for Trump, however close you appear to be, you can become
expendable at a moment's notice. There is no loyalty, and anyone who breaks an
oath to the Constitution will also break the promise to you. Conspirators who
succeed in overthrowing the government don't have to respect your property, or
your contracts, or your life. Business depends on the rule of law, and MAGA is
against the rule of law.
The moral reasons and the business reasons are clear. You can go against the
customer demographic and the associate demographic, against the Constitution,
against the stability on which business depends, and against your own safety, or you
can be in solidarity to defend the republic.
Please vote for my proposal.

Thank you, Mr.Harmse. The proxy holders have informed the company that they will
vote against this proposal.
This concludes all of the matters to be presented for shareholder consideration at
the meeting. It is now 11:07 a.m., and the polls are now closed.
Based on the initial report from the Inspectors of Election, the preliminary voting
results are as follows. Each director nominee has been elected by a majority of the
votes cast. Each of the other company proposals has passed, and the shareholder
proposals and the ﬂoor proposal have failed to receive a majority of the votes cast
and therefore, it did not pass.
The preliminary voting results will be announced in a press release later today, and
the oﬃcial results will be disclosed in a filing with the SEC. The 2023 Annual
Shareholders' Meeting is now formally adjourned.
We'll now pause brieﬂy before moving into a Q&A session moderated by Kary
Brunner, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
Questions And Answers

A - Doug McMillon
A - Donna Morris(Question And Answer)

Good morning. I'm Kary Brunner, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Walmart.
We will now take some time to respond to questions submitted through the Virtual
Meeting platform. Senior leadership is here, and we will answer as many questions
as we can during this time. For questions that could not be answered due to time
constraints, the company will provide responses on the Investor Relations section of
our corporate website. Similar questions will be grouped together and responded to
collectively.
Okay. The first shareholder question is, when will we get the MyShare program back?

This is Doug McMillon speaking. I believe the question is related to Walmart U.S. and
the cash incentive plan. We made a number of adjustments. Things are always
changing as it relates to compensation.
We've asked Kim Lupo, who's the Senior Vice President of Total Rewards, which
means she leads Compensation and Benefits to respond to this question.

Thanks so much, Doug, and thanks so much for the question. At Walmart, our goal is
to deliver competitive, market-attractive pay across all roles and markets. And we
continuously examine the offerings that we provide to ensure they're aligned with
that desire. And we have continuously been making investments in our U.S.
associates, particularly at our clubs, distribution centers, and stores, with the average
hourly rate now over $17.50 an hour.
I mentioned our investments in competitive pay. Again, we are always -- we are as
well looking to invest in our portfolio of benefits to invest in the financial, emotional,
and physical well-being of our associates. Thanks so much for the question.

Only thing I would add is that since 2015, we've increased our average hourly
compensation by 54% and our starting wages by more than 90%. And we'll continue
to look at things like MyShare and see if it makes sense to add back to some of the
roles to create the right incentives. We're designing a ladder of opportunity, and
from entry-level roles all the way up to store managers and beyond, we want those
sequential steps to make sense. So that's one of the things that's on our mind.
I think Donna Morris, who leads our people team, wants to add a comment.

A - Doug McMillon
A - Kary Brunner
A - Doug McMillon
A - Kary BrunnerThanks, Doug. I think it's important to also underscore that that path of opportunity
does not provide a ceiling for our associates. 75% of our store managers started in
the frontline and were encouraged by the continued internal growth and
development of our associates.

Thank you for the question.

The next shareholder question is based on a recent incident at the Amite, Louisiana
store, where an armed criminal entered the store and the store had to be evacuated.
The question is, why can't Walmart leadership provide better security measures than
the current policy of avoid, deny, and defend when employees are not allowed their
personal firearms? And why is there not a much-needed armed security guard
defending the premises?

This is Doug McMillon. As it relates to safety and security, that has always been a
priority for us, and it's even more so today given how our environment's changing.
It's really important to us, of course, that our associates and customers are safe. We
use a variety of tactics to try and create that environment in every one of our
locations, and there's a variety of circumstances depending on the location. So we
try to match what we're doing with the characteristics of that particular location, and
we're constantly reviewing those. And in the case of this Louisiana location, we'll go
back and have another look at it.
I would add that we along with other retailers, are hoping that communities with
increasing crime rates will make adjustments and prioritize safety. We don't believe
that the retail industry alone can solve this issue, so we're asking for broader support
as it relates to this.

Another shareholder submitted a question. Walmart's policies state that the
company does not tolerate the use of forced labor, including the use of involuntary
prison labor, and that its suppliers must also prevent these practices. As reported by
human rights defenders and their families, Milwaukee Tool is using forced prison
labor in China to produce its work gloves, which are sold by Walmart. We appreciate
that these gloves are no longer available for sale on Walmart's website, but there has
been no disclosure on Walmart's efforts to address and remediate these human
rights abuses. In fact, when the Business and Human Rights Resource Center invited
Walmart to respond publicly about these abuses in December of 2021, it did not
respond.
Can Walmart verify that it has ceased sales of all Milwaukee Tool gloves and provide
information about how it's conducting human rights due diligence with this vendor
to investigate the links to forced prison labor?
A - Doug McMillon
A - Kathleen McLaughlin
Human rights are obviously important to us. And for those that are interested, you
can find our statement online. We want to make sure we have the right expectations
of ourselves and the right policies, but also the right resources to follow up on those
expectations.
And I believe Kathleen McLaughlin, who's our Chief Sustainability Oﬃcer and the
President of our Foundation, and is very involved in sourcing issues of this type,
would like to make an additional comment.

Yes. Thank you. We looked into the allegations regarding the gloves in question, and
we made a decision to de-list those from the marketplace as noted, so the gloves
that were implicated in the allegations.
Maybe I can say a couple of words about our approach to human rights due
diligence in your broader question. So as we describe in our human rights ESG brief,
which I would invite people to take a look at, our human rights due diligence
process reﬂects core elements of due diligence recognized by the UN Guiding
Principles and requested in the proposal.
In that, the company's approach involves, first of all, an assessment of potential
impacts. So we assess the potential impacts of various means, including consulting
subject matter experts in human rights, examining Walmart's ethics and compliance,
and responsible sourcing allegations and findings. We consult external data sources
and reports, and we take a look at issues through our enterprise risk management
process. That's really the first step for us as a company.
Then, second, in terms of continuous improvement and adjusting our overall
operational practices, sourcing practices, and so on, we integrate and act on
findings. So we use the findings from the assessments to create and enhance
practices that embed respect for salient human rights issues in our business. So that
includes updating our policies and our procedures to account for risks that we've
discovered, training and communicating to relevant Walmart associates and
suppliers, modifying practices to reduce potential impacts.
So for example, as a result of recent findings, we've modified sourcing standards for
products, engaged suppliers to address specific issues and improve practices. We've
developed and disseminated materials and assist to build capacity with suppliers,
and we funded programs through business and philanthropy that really help train
actors in supply chains, especially in higher-risk supply chains, and I invite you to
look at our disclosures for more examples.
Third aspect of our human rights due diligence is tracking the effectiveness of our
responses. So we track our progress on salient human rights issues in a number of
ways. First of all, reviewing the data from associate voice and engagement channels,
A - Doug McMillon
A - Kary Brunnercontext that come in through our ethics hotlines and disclosure channels, Walmart
associate diversity and representation data, our pay equity analyses, results from our
responsible sourcing program, and that would include detailed information from
factory audits and case management processes. And of course, also feedback from
our direct engagement with human rights experts and organizations. So it's a very
comprehensive approach across our business.
And then finally, fourth, in terms of human rights due diligence, we do communicate
how we've addressed the impacts. We transparently report our progress on salient
human rights issues in various publications, which include our human capital issue
brief, ESG issue brief, our equity inclusion issue brief, people in supply chains brief,
ethics and compliance brief, safer, healthier products brief, and of course, our
human rights brief, which again, I'd invite people to take a look at. So that's our
overall approach. It's comprehensive.
Now, with respect to the specific question about supplier risk and assessments, as
part of this broader due diligence program and acting on findings, we do have our
responsible program -- responsible sourcing program, which includes audits of
facilities based on risk. And so we'll take a look at the regions and territories of our
supply chains. We'll look at channels. We'll look at prior audit results. And based on
that, we make a determination of higher-risk channels and supply chains. Based on
that, we ask our suppliers to conduct audits. And we work with 11 third-party audit
programs to conduct those audits.
And we ask our suppliers to disclose their facilities to us and abide by the standards.
Last year, we had 14,000 such audits conducted that we assessed. And based on
them, we rate them in terms of green, orange, red, and we take action on what we
find. So in the last year of those 14,000 audits that were reviewed, 8.7% resulted in an
orange rating. And our first instance is to work with folks to remediate. So out of all
of those 2% of the ones that we identified ended up in a second year having a
finding. And in some cases, if we aren't able to remediate, we'll take action up to and
including termination of the supplier.
We also bring cases based on tips that we get through our anonymous hotlines. For
example, across our supplier base, we have a 24x7 global helpline in 29 languages,
and we do bring in cases. Last year, we had 800 cases that we then investigate. And
similar to the audit program, if we have findings that are substantiated, the penalties
can result in termination of the supplier.

Kathleen, thank you. Ms.Bowden, thank you for the question.

Okay. The next shareholder question states, the company has engaged in public
commentary on a wide range of topics, including, but not limited to minimum wage
laws, abortion, social equity, and the regeneration of nature. Public polling indicates
that the nation is severely politically and culturally divided and becoming
increasingly so. In addition, polling indicates that a majority of Americans disapprove
A - Doug McMillon
A - Dan Bartlett
A - Doug McMillon
A - Kathleen McLaughlin
A - Doug McMillonof corporations involving themselves in such matters. What are the direct
shareholder benefits of such statements? Are there not risks of political backlash?

Thank you for the question, Ms.Boyer.
Dan Bartlett, who leads Corporate Affairs, and I should probably both comment on
this, but Dan, would you like to go first?

Sure, Doug. It's been our experience, particularly over the last 20 years, that we
maximize shareholder value for shareholders by serving all of our stakeholders,
delivering value to our customers, creating economic opportunity for associates and
suppliers, and strengthening local communities and enhancing the sustainability of
our business and product supply chains. So as we think about how we engage on
the issues in the public sphere, it's with that in mind, and how we can advance the
business interests of our stores, clubs, distribution centers around the world, but also
as we can advance the interests of our communities and how we show up in those
communities and to reﬂect the values of both of our associates and our customers.
So we take that responsibility seriously and do that with those -- with that framework
in mind.

Thanks, Dan. I think the only thing I would add is that, we don't wake up in the
morning wanting to go and make social or political statements. We're a retailer.
We've been managing the incoming more than trying to initiate outgoing. We do
think about the things that Dan mentioned with the ultimate goal being that we want
everybody to feel comfortable shopping with us and choose Walmart, everybody.
And we want everybody to feel comfortable and excited about working at Walmart.
So, we have a very diverse workforce around the world. We have a very diverse
workforce here in the United States. We end up through the large base of customers
and associates having every view be represented in our company and we respect
that diversity. And the things that we do say are responsive in nature, thinking about
our own associates as well as those customers.
Kathleen McLaughlin, did you want to make an additional comment?

No, I think you said it. We want to serve our stakeholders because that's the way we
create value for our business.

Thank you. Appreciate the question and understand the significance of the issue.
A - Kary Brunner
A - Doug McMillon
A - Kathleen McLaughlin
Okay. Our next question is, how is the company using green energy or have a plan
to boost the use of green energy to help increase their bottom line, as well as taking
advantage of the Inﬂation Reduction Act?

Kathleen, you're going to be busy this morning, it looks like. Would you mind
responding to this one as well?

Yes. Sure thing. Green energy is an important part of our energy strategy. We've got
goals to enhance energy security and affordability for our business and our
customers while helping the company achieve our science-based target for zero
emissions in our operations by 2040. This year, we've reported a cumulative 23%
reduction in our emissions relative to our 2015 baseline.
So, in terms of green energy and how it factors in, yes, there's a few priorities. So first
of all, renewable energy, we're now at about 46% of our global electricity needs
coming from renewable sources, and that's both from the grid and also our own
contracts and projects that are about 28%.
On-site generation, we have over 600 projects around the world, 10 different
countries. We were ranked fourth overall and third in the nation, in the U.S. and on-
site in the 2022 Solar Means Business Report.
Another key strategy is EPAs. The U.S. EPA basically cited us as being the top retail
partner in terms of annual green power usage. And that was a report that came out
in January.
Clean energy investments, we have a number of these in different markets. For
example, with Cypress Creek out in North Carolina, community solar, a 70-megawatt
solar project that's helping power 14,000 households in North Carolina. And we
have been strong advocates for policy in different markets, where, again, that
outcomes are aligned with our business, IRA would be an example.
Transportation, that's another one. We are looking for ways to electrify and power
our ﬂeet. And we've started with yard trucks, last-mile delivery. We've got, gosh, 1,100
electric vehicle last-mile delivery trucks ordered through Ford that we started to
deploy. And we're testing a bunch of different technologies for zero-emissions
vehicles, so hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, et cetera. So different technologies to try
to figure out what can we do over time for our big heavy Class 8 tractors.
EV charging, we were already one of the biggest providers of EV charging for
customers in the United States with 1,300 stations across 280 locations. And you
might have seen we recently announced a big expansion of that. We hope by 2030
A - Doug McMillon
A - Kary Brunner
A - Doug McMillon
A - John David Raineyto have thousands of EV charging opportunities at our stores and clubs across the
U.S.
And of course, energy eﬃciency, that's always been a great one to drop right to the
bottom line. We've been at that for a long time, converting to LED light bulbs and
doing things like that, that continues to be a really important strategy.
So taken together, I think your core question is, does this create value for us?
Absolutely. And that's the way we're coming at it. This is really about securing our
own needs, helping out our customers and communities in a way that really does
enhance the value of our business. So thanks for the question.

Thanks, Kathleen. And thank you, Mr.Bashin, for the question.

Okay. We have time for one more question, and that is from a shareholder that says,
how is Walmart preparing for a possible recession later this year?

Thank you for the question, Ms.Ku [ph]. I'll respond, too, but I think John David
Rainey, our CFO, maybe, should go first.

Sure. Happy to, Doug. As part of our normal planning process, we consider a range
of possibilities in terms of the economic environment. We want to make sure that we
are addressing not only the need to maximize revenue and profits but also looking
at our balance sheet as well and making sure that we have access to capital at the
lowest possible cost, which we did when we entered the markets earlier this year.
But fundamentally, what we've seen over this period of more recent higher inﬂation
is that, consumer wallets are squeezed, and that's affecting their consumer behavior
in terms of what they're purchasing, what they're buying.
And so our value proposition really stands or resonates more now than ever before.
And what I'm referring to is helping customers save money and live better. And we
do that by offering the everyday low prices to our customers but also, as Doug noted
in his prepared remarks, providing convenience at a level that we haven't done
before, much more so now. And I think importantly, the latter convenience is
important to our customer and member base in any economic environment. And so
fundamentally, we want to make sure that our value proposition resonates when
consumer wallets are pressured.
The second thing I'd say around this is there's evermore need to be diligent around
our cost structure. And as we've talked about on a couple of occasions earlier this
A - Doug McMillon
A - Kary Brunner
Operatoryear, we've made investments in our supply chain automation over the last couple of
years and we'll continue to do so in the future.
And what this does, which is very important in the economic environment, is this
lowers our cost to serve. And in fact, if we fast forward five years and we look at the
investments that we've contemplated, we expect that our cost to fulfill for our
customers will reduce by about 20% from where it is today. And so again, focusing
on our value proposition for customers and making sure that we're providing that
value proposition at the very lowest possible cost.

Our founder once said something to the effect of, there may be a recession coming,
let's choose not to participate. And our mindset is something like that. As John David
said, we want to offer a great value. And if families have more money, that's great for
us. And if families are pressured, we want to be there for them. So we're trying to
work hard right now, as we have been for quite some time now, with our suppliers to
get our prices down, whether that's in food or in general merchandise.
We think the company's positioned to succeed, regardless of the environment. We
can save people money. We can serve them through stores and clubs. We can serve
them pickup and delivery. We can save them time in ways that we couldn't before.
And so we're offensive in nature, but try to be intelligent about the inventory choices
we're making. We're merchants. There are some items that can just absolutely blow
out, and we should be aggressive on those. And in some other categories, we
should be conservative. And that type of portfolio management is what our
merchants do every day. So that's our focus.

That concludes our Q&A session. Thank you for your interest in Walmart, and have a
good day. This concludes our meeting.
The host has ended this call. Goodbye.
