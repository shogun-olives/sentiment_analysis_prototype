Good morning. And thank you for calling Costco Wholesale Corporation. I'm Jeff
Elliott, Assistant Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. And this morning I
will review with you our sales results for the four week retail month of April, which
started on Monday, April 8 and ended on Sunday, May 5.
For comparable sales results, this four-week period is compared to the same four-
week period last year, specifically Monday, April 9 through Sunday, May 6. April
included 28 selling days for both years.
Before I begin, let me start by stating that the following discussions will include
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. For these purposes, forward-looking statements are statements
that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company
expects or anticipates may occur in the future. Such forward-looking statements
involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance
to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.
These risks and uncertainties include. But are not limited to, domestic and
international economic conditions, including exchange rates; the effects of
competition and regulation; uncertainties in financial markets; consumer and small
business spending patterns and debt levels; conditions affecting the acquisition,
development, ownership or use of real estate; actions of vendors; rising costs
associated with employees, including healthcare costs, energy and certain
commodities; geopolitical conditions and other risks identified from time to time in
the Company's public statements; and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update these
discussions due to subsequent events or circumstances.
Now, with regard to sales. As reported in today's press release, net sales for the
month of April came in at $7.98 billion for the four weeks ended May 5, up 7%
compared to the $7.48 billion reported for the same period last year.
Net sales for the 35 weeks ended May 5 came in at $69.0 billion this year, up 9%
compared to the $63.59 billion for the same period last year.
Comparable sales results for the four-week April retail month and the 35-week fiscal
year-to-date reporting periods are as follows. US four weeks, plus 4%; US 35 weeks,
plus 6%; International four weeks, plus 3%; International 35 weeks, plus 6%; total
Company four weeks, plus 4%; total Company 35 weeks, plus 6%.
Changes in both gasoline prices year over year and foreign exchange had a
negative impact on comparable sales for the four-week April reporting period.
Conversely, gasoline and FX had a very slightly positive impact on the 35-week
reporting period.
Excluding these effects, comparable sales were as follows. US four weeks, plus 6%;
US 35 weeks, plus 6%; International four weeks, plus 6%; International 35 weeks,
plus 6%; total Company four weeks, plus 6%; total Company 35 weeks, plus 6%.
In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights for the
month of April were as follows. On a regional and country basis, the US regions with
the strongest results were Texas, Southeast and Midwest. On an international basis in
local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Canada, Mexico and Japan.
Moving on to our merchandise highlights, the following comparable sales results, by
category, exclude the negative impact of foreign exchange.
Food and Sundries comparable sales for the month were in the mid-single-digit
range. Within Food and Sundries, the departments with the strongest results were
candy, cooler, liquor and frozen foods. We experienced a slight amount of inﬂation
in Food and Sundries compared to last year.
Comp sales results for Hardlines were also up mid-single digit. Better performing
departments were hardware, garden, health and beauty aids. And consumer
electronics.
Softlines experienced positive comp sales results in the low double-digit range.
Better performing departments within Softlines include small appliances,
housewares. And apparel.
Fresh Foods experienced positive comp results in the mid to high single-digit range
for the month. Produce and service deli experienced the strongest results. Fresh
Foods did not experience any meaningful inﬂation or deﬂation for the month.
Within the Ancillary businesses, optical and hearing aids produced the best comp
sales increases. Gasoline sales were slightly negative year over year. The average
sale price per gallon was 9% lower at $3.57 this year compared to $3.90 last year.
Overall, gasoline price deﬂation had a negative impact of a little over 1% on April
comparable sales. Comp gallons were up year over year.
Weakening foreign currencies, relative to the US dollar, primarily in Canada and
Japan, resulted in a detriment to our reported April comparable sales of a little less
than 1%.
Total international comps for the four-week period came in at plus 6% in local
currencies. But resulted in a reported comp of plus 3% when converted to US
dollars.
The average transaction decreased year over year in April approximately 0.5%, or
about 50 basis points, which includes the minus 2% negative impact from foreign
exchange and gasoline price deﬂation. Without these impacts, the average
transaction would have been up approximately 1.5%.
Comparable traﬃc frequency was up about 4.5%. Cannibalization for the month of
April had a negative impact to total Company comparable sales of a little over 0.5%.
Looking ahead, May sales will include 27 selling days in the US for both years, since
Costco closes for the Memorial Day holiday. The reporting period will end on
Sunday, June 2 and will be compared to the four weeks ended June 3 last year. We
plan to announce May sales on Thursday, June 6, 2013.
