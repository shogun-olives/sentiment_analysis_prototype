okay , everybody , n't start . happy hot cloud company seattle join u slot . 've instructed read safe harbor statement start . begin , microsoft may make forward- looking statement presentation refer sec filing risk factor relating business . 's true whether 're person listening web . check . mike schutz kind enough ﬂown join u db event . mike , maybe could talk little bit role , term title , general manager cloud platform marketing , know part microsoft 's broader cloud enterprise unit . maybe 's worth starting little description everything context . absolutely . thank , karl . hi , everybody . , name mike schutz . 'm general manager cloud platform product marketing . responsibility include cloud platform capability . would include private cloud capability like window server , system center ; public cloud microsoft azure expect talk lot today . enterprise mobility capability would also fall within umbrella microsoft cloud platform . product within new cloud enterprise division . really pleased today . got . 's important point start , people think microsoft cloud generally think azure , maybe broadly defined include oﬃce 365. definition provided cloud platform extends well beyond . mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz 's right . start top level think microsoft cloud microsoft commercial cloud . think oﬃce 365 , dynamic crm azure capability within . double click within cloud platform capability really want focus , 's 40-odd service within microsoft azure . roughly fall category like infrastructure-as-a-service . hybrid cloud perspective , well raw storage compute . cloud platform capability , platform-as-a-service . organization think modernizing application . isvs think building cloud native application saas apps . 's lot platform capability offer azure . data platform capability . think extending value application really taking advantage big data analytics , hadoop , structured unstructured data , machine learning extending advanced analytics iot . lastly enterprise mobility . increasingly mobile world help organization get handle security manageability mobile productive workforce , providing companion service oﬃce 365 help organization secure device , secure application ultimately data . 's kind breadth cloud asset . also think offering consistent private cloud capability organization build private cloud hybrid cloud using technology cut cloth public cloud put data center . mike , think across cloud asset think recent demand trend , thing 've picked feel like inﬂection point change last -- pick , six month ; whether 's kind workload microsoft 's customer moving ; whether vertical really inﬂected term migration cloud ? demand trend worth calling group ? sure , absolutely . first thing , biggest change 's happened last 12 18 month conversation shifted cloud move cloud embrace . different vertical different challenge respect regulatory compliance , data sovereignty , geographic distribution , etc . large 're seeing tremendous appetite decision maker , nit decision maker line business look cloud , whether saas apps , whether thinking modernizing infrastructure . infrastructure-as-a-service proven lowest friction way start cloud . think starting dev test [ ph ] , bringing application try bringing application back prem starting point . karl keirstead mike schutzthing line business application infrastructure-as-a-service . benefit infrastructure-as-a-service always kind take existing app without modification run cloud even though designed cloud . lot customer taken step , least part application estate . 's le moving app think extending data center extending asset cloud . term demand signal 're seeing , one , huge , explosive growth infrastructure-as-a-service . organization get comfortable cloud understand benefit cost saving ultimately agility 're able provide organization , able thing faster instead waiting week month get server deployed infrastructure new app deployed , demand . moving higher-level service like platform-as-a-service getting analytics capability . 're seeing lot increased usage higher-level service one example . got . maybe dive different component microsoft 's cloud platform -- mentioned beginning likely , 'll talk azure part 's right . 's hot topic . obviously microsoft n't disclose azure revenue . talked call gave u usage metric suggests growing pretty good clip . obviously aws giant multiple larger azure , whatever azure number . 've got competitor like google . 've got ibm softlayer . 's hyperscale 's also hypercompetitive . think everyone would love hear two three main way 're trying differentiate infrastructure space ? particular , aws big , differentiating aws ? sure , absolutely . 's great question . often dialogue customer many customer tried used aws 's absolutely dialogue frequently . talked hyperscale . fundamentally one way differentiate . 's couple three hyperscale cloud world , u one . operate today 19 region , mean 19 data center region globally . continue expand customer need u . put perspective , 's twice many aws five six time google cloud platform . even combined aws google cloud , 're region two combined . hyperscale important . 's important customer want service customer . 's one fundamental tenet . aws big , . karl keirstead mike schutzthe element . really differentiation come , around hybrid . fundamental strategy help customer deploy technology put public cloud hyperscale data center run data center top hyper-v , top system center asset , well bringing azure infrastructure-as-a-service platform-as-a-service capability run data center , ﬂexibility help decide application move . also set capability provide connective tissue private cloud public cloud , whether customer running private cloud technology . example , storage product called storsimple -- think like set-top box storage environment . 's iscsi storage device plug existing environment premise look like storage area network seamlessly tier storage cloud . customer think data center seamlessly extending . 's fundamental differentiation approach respect hyperscale cloud vendor , 's public cloud bust . want meet customer . 's hybrid element . core strategy , frankly , quite important customer existing asset invest premise extend yet still fully embrace public cloud . element around enterprise route enterprise-grade support . 650,000 partner worldwide . broad footprint existing customer base trusted partner . also focus hard security privacy compliance . first public cloud provider globally support iso 27018 standard highest standard privacy today . 's important international customer well customer north america . enterprise credibility element dna helping customer enterprise core strategy . highest level kind microsoft . yes . capability perspective 're also differentiated level service relative competitor . infrastructure-as-a-service , said , 's lot player . microsoft aws leader gartner magic quadrant perspective infrastructure-as-a-service . aws leader public cloud paas platform microsoft . well storage-as-a-service amazon also play . think breadth microsoft offering . help align customer looking move time think application modernization running vms cloud , well broad footprint trust enterprise community . karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz yes . actually question , know microsoft n't disclosed zack probably going shake head ask question . talk little bit differentiation running vms cloud ? pure compute service storage infrastructure versus premium service top ? metric share ? maybe anecdote around mix azure changing ? well let tell 're seeing -- outside specific metric . certainly infrastructure-as-a-service onramp cloud . azure app service , paas platform azure , fast-growing service u data platform service . see entry point customer start oftentimes infrastructure-as-a-service combine infrastructure-as-a- service plus next-gen app platform part go . move see addition premium service continue see growth . okay . could ask question one -- think get opportunity leverage microsoft 's incredible software portfolio . 's really little bit double-edge sword , get perceived potential client azure little bit microsoft-centric bad thing 've got aws pitching sort swiss neutrality . get beyond issue really ( inaudible ) azure . n't yet , far know , full red hat enterprise limited support azure . think everyone would love microsoft open third-party technology part azure . journey ? 's absolutely huge focus hope everybody seeing progress 've made . fact , today 20 % , 20 % virtual machine azure infrastructure-as-a-service running linux . think openness broadly . platform used window platform azure platform focus application . could window , could linux . whether operating system layer window linux , whether 's data layer . think 've got oracle supported azure , sap , ibm db2 . also hadoop , cloudera , datastax . lot popular data layer capability , outside sql server , course , believe great . whatever customer want data layer want support . -- mobile device standpoint great solution help customer build mobile apps connect mobile apps android , io device , well course window device . language perspective believe .net karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutzgreat . time , want make sure developer familiar would like use java , node.js , php , ruby . whatever like choose want available microsoft azure . 've made lot progress support app , o microsoft azure 'll continue make announcement go . think , mike , 's opportunity enhance relationship , partnership red hat provide rhel support azure ? continue make progress work . 're excited future might bring . okay , good . mentioned minute ago ﬂipping little bit enterprise mobility side . 's area 're hearing microsoft . seems one popular , quote , premium service cloud platform . yes . talk little bit ? sound like 're putting amazing growth lot people room aware airwatch -- owned vmware 's extremely well . mobileiron . obviously 's competitive space . blackberry bought good . differentiate front ? well enterprise mobility perspective 're absolutely correct . 're pleased growth 've customer adoption customer success enterprise mobility suite . 're familiar , em provides combination set category , point , discreet point player one . 're hearing mobile device management increasingly turning mobile application management discreet set folk like airwatch mobileiron played . 've got solution called microsoft intune part mobile -- enterprise mobility suite . identity management perspective actor directory identity protecting user identity always critical customer . provide online service called azure active directory premium help provide single sign karl keirstead mike schutzon authentication control saas application , oﬃce 365 , crm online . 2,500 saas apps like workday , like salesforce , like others . help control access maintain security enterprise using saas apps 's key part . last component enterprise mobility suite called right management . 's service help encrypt data encrypt file encryption follows file wherever may . even get saved usb drive ca n't accessed unauthorized user . 've done bring layered approach security device , application , data user identity wrap easy deploy , easy purchase solution . 're -- last report reported 17,000 customer using em today . continue see great growth pleased . 's perfect companion oﬃce 365. deep integration oﬃce 365 mobile apps io well microsoft platform . 're really solution deep integration oﬃce 365 , provides u breadth differentiation . also richness experience provide end user . world mobility end user really king queen . really important end user great experience , well appropriate level control . got . 're going take plenty question 'm sure cloud stuff . open want ask area responsibility around traditional enterprise side . think mentioned window server system center stuff like . sit server product realm get statistic impressed . question specifically microsoft done bang-up job server product side several year , 've posting growth close high single digit , low double digit far exceeded oracle ibm lot big peer putting . know 's number reason . might share gain . might guy great job maintenance attach rate . might pricing licensing change . we're always eager get color 've able pull . point couple reason server product number last two year good ? sure . 'll talk window server first think sql server important element well . window server perspective continues popular operating system plant . look analyst report 's somewhere 70 % 80 % share term operating system share . karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead yes . paid -- . paid operating system . yes . see continued revenue growth 've driven business model largely around mix shift premium skus . window server case really revolves around movement virtualization . organization virtualize application server , premium mix window server continues grow . even world x86 server shipment number might soft , premium mix organization virtualization infrastructure squeeze value , able benefit increased revenue . also , 's much data explosion happening need server ration across data . data explosion help sql server business , absolutely 'll talk . also help drive server deployment , cloud , 's certainly premise , . secular force virtualization data really helping server business , particularly premium mix . sql server front certainly explosion data consolidation customer respect database workload really beneficial sql business ; , driving premium shift , core , premium mix sql server . also share gain respect sql server becoming . , mission-critical workload organization . taking tier 1 workload . look gartner 's magic quadrant relational database system , first year microsoft passed oracle cloud asset , well sql server strength premise . 's really helped fuel growth traditional server business . okay . window server business , 'm mistaken largest component whole server product revenue bucket . sql server 's obviously pretty good well . look total server product number disclose , think june quarter microsoft decelerated little bit think 's pulled little bit commercial licensing growth number . n't much explanation earnings call outside think amy ﬂagged mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz karl keirstead mike schutz - karl keirstead q - unidentified participantwindows server managing grow despite relatively weak x86 server market . could elaborate broader server product business microsoft june quarter window server particular ? well server number think constant currency 9 % , outpace peer market . okay . lot fueled innovation 've delivered last wave window server 2012 , well announcement made 2016 wave . 're pretty excited customer pretty excited 2016 wave 's preview right . combine rock-solid virtualization platform lot new technology born azure public cloud 're going able deliver premise . well new container technology -- container pretty exciting day -- new container technology making window server 2016. okay . lot 's fueling growth . question answer okay . 've got know audience probably couple , mike . anybody question mike around azure around part microsoft server product set ? 'll go right front . oh , mic back . go ahead . yes . 's fair amount buzz given sort latency sloth microsoft -- , microsoft -- mastercard visa securing e- commerce guy interest high-level discussion bank directly player creating browser solution would secure e-commerce way copacetic internet general . - - mike schutz q - unidentified participant - mike schutz- would likely operationally sound . perspective ? n't announcement make today . general , whether financial vertical , 're focused security element helping organization secure using cloud . also providing product help secure . announcement . yes . yes . thanks taking question . question around -- hinted 's something satya talked well . technology developed solution developed azure , applying premise 's potentially enabling share gain . walk dynamic -- faster go market ? 's driving improve technology 's done azure ? way think 's virtuous cycle building public cloud , battle testing cloud bringing customer run data center . great example hyper-v , virtualization platform . 've hyper-v long time . 've leader vmware virtualization better part last decade . azure run hyper-v. 've got hundred thousand node battle testing hyper-v every day . feedback go directly hyper-v product team . able make product better rock solid deliver every customer , whether enterprise -- enterprise customer , service provider . - - living public cloud lifestyle helping organization put data center really differentiator u . area 're even simple thing like azure portal . place average pro developer go spin vm app demand azure . 've bought portal organization run data center call azure pack . , service provider , 'm hoster . n't roll portal . use one microsoft built focus higher-level , value-add service . enterprise space , enterprise really trying service provider business unit agile , help delivering cloud computing technology battle tested public cloud environment . still make decision want go public cloud , application go . way , , mobility , 's 've got consistent platform premise provides lot le friction think going public cloud . end-to-end vision . - karl keirstead - mike schutz - karl keirstead - mike schutz - karl keirstead - mike schutz - karl keirstead - mike schutzsatya talk sometimes term server edge cloud . customer perspective , azure seamless extension data center 's virtuous cycle product development perspective . started window server 2012 r2 , one 's market 's kind fueling growth see . 's even 2016 wave . virtuous cycle developing cloud bringing customer premise really hitting stride . thanks . anybody else ? okay , 'll keep going . mike window server side think legacy version window server 's going end life . -- big deal microsoft ? mean suppose 're date maintenance get free . maybe 's large constituency , 's revenue lift . would characterize opportunity microsoft ? version speak window server 2003. 's right . actually went support july 15th 've passed data . -- point , little bit different dynamic xp . lot customer maintenance product -- . right . n't yet deployed newer version . focus help customer get newer version . 're necessarily focused revenue uplift might bring . okay . window server side , room attend red hat event 's basically dockercon event day . anything touching server o layer seems container docker ecosystem . mentioned earlier microsoft providing window server 2016 support docker . elaborate little bit ? seems big deal server o space . - karl keirsteadabsolutely . general , cloud native modern app development paradigm standpoint , concept micro service container pretty hot day . public cloud provider saas provider pretty ﬂuent 's starting make way broader community . docker really helped popularize thing 've done make easy consume container simplify . going back little bit , 18 month ago announced docker support linux azure . 've support . we've made couple announcement since docker 're integrating docker hub microsoft azure continuing deepen organization would like use container linux docker prepackaged solution azure . example 've got ubuntu image docker tooling preinstalled developer spin get going , quickly . 's traditional linux container azure docker . 've also , mentioned , announced 'll bringing container window server 2016. announced window server container similar paradigm linux container , light-weight run time virtualizes operating system instead whole server get high density developer productive developing rolling new application . 's preview . 've got developer trying today part 2016 wave . 're also bringing first kind type container called hyper-v container brings best high-density , light-weight container known today industry additional isolation benefit virtualization context bring . one thing often hear particularly enterprise around security container making sure feel comfortable using . customer untrusted third-party code 'd like one layer security container world 've got hyper-v container . developer really n't make difference 's underlying window server container . 's wrapped another layer security term hyper-v virtualization context . , continue work docker . 're deep collaboration . also bringing new container technology actually exist today rest market next window server release . letting developer choose . want run linux container window container microsoft azure . last question mike ? mike , 'll end one question , . lot discussion around thing like server o layer cloud end conversation next-gen cloud native application , open source , etc . feel like larger firm moving little bit aggressively today try stay relevant world next-gen architecture infrastructure look - mike schutz - karl keirstead - mike schutz - karl keirstead - mike schutz - karl keirstead - mike schutzdifferent . 's open source , 's containerized , etc . high level kind thing microsoft stay relevant new saas next generation developer building ? well part making sure 're working openly community , whether open source community working partner innovating space leverage platform able build application using technology . actually using innovation 've used container micro service cloud year . right . commercializing bringing market . innovation . working openly industry ecosystem , like open container initiative linux foundation help bring unified container model market . working much open source community , well development community 've known year . got . well microsoft obviously ton success cloud platform fun day microsoft good luck continuing scale exciting part microsoft story . thanks coming db tech event . thank much . yes . thanks u .
