's karl keirstead ubs . super happy microsoft keynoting 2020 virtual ubs tmt conference . especially delighted judson althoff , executive vice president worldwide commercial business . judson elaborate , think microsoft consumer element , commercial element . judson essentially head entire go-to-market effort commercial side . pretty critical role . term format , 'll go 40 minute . question , use question link . read front . prefer , email directly karl.keirstead @ ubs.com , 'll take way . , judson , thanks carving time day spend client . absolutely , karl . thanks . question answer yes . terrific . well , judson , n't start something near dear heart ? 's sale effort microsoft . think everybody sort know took organization sale reorg 1.5 year ago . feel like investor totally forgot execution brilliant assume whatever - judson althofftinkering , n't really discernible impact result phenomenal . guess may behind scene . might nice opportunity describe reorg , exactly . judgment , turned . sure . thanks ﬂattering way set . mean , high-level perspective believe 're journey , 're working pretty hard transformation , still long way go company want . yes , 's several year . gone pretty major go-to- market restructuring . changing model 50,000 people work every day interesting thing . much would note , exactly call wall street say , `` hey , could kind look way couple quarter ? trust u , everything going fine . '' deliver current long-range plan whilst effectively changing engine plane ﬂying time . five pillar approach 'll cover brieﬂy know number question get short period time . first pillar industry pillar , get laser-focused organizing industry . period time evolution compute high-tech industry customer trying transform digitally , sort obvious direction become far industry-aligned . want help someone transformation , know business well . digital transformation business-led followed technology . technology servant transformation . u getting deep across top industry , obvious one , financial service , health care , manufacturing , retail also public sector well . super critical u realign focus industry . also tech pillar , might seem obvious , microsoft pre-satya sort pre-transformation really atrophied lot innovation . satya quick early ceo tenure point industry n't respect tradition rather respect innovation . , karl , effectively go back school . retrain lot folk . , unfortunately , let go lot sale overlay role exchange hiring developer sale organization , customer-facing group , could effectively roll sleeve write code right alongside customer . bit tech renaissance , , solution area . compete commercial sector five main area : modern work technology use every day ; business application portfolio ; core apps infrastructure , think lift , shift , modernized cloud ; data artificial intelligence ; course security , underpins . five core area - karl keirstead - judson althofffor u area retrain lot folk , hire lot new folk , like said , kind go back school . third pillar invest world-class customer success organization . think nonbillable consulting , people live customer beyond deal . consumption economy , cloud really , role super critical sell design concept , help customer really adopt cloud service evolve . customer success organization pretty critical evolution last several year . last two pillar . fourth one seems like mean end , honestly , . wickedly grateful investment made pandemic , served u incredibly well , roll call digital sale force . see first three thing mentioned pretty expensive . organizing industry best way talk customer , 's expensive way talk customer . hiring developer sale force expensive asset . nonbillable consulting , well , implies 're making money resource . expensive thing higher-end client . way offset get digital sale engine , connecting digital marketing digital sale resource , system feed qualified intelligence-driven lead inside sale team , providing next-best action , real- time sale coaching , objection handling , using tech sort feed machine way address scale need business . fifth pillar reimagining partner model , getting ip run platform would effectively represent sell vertical . power like pulling health care isp say , `` hey , listen , 're going help put product platform , 're actually going turn around help sell measure people 's success , '' hugely beneficial u . five pillar transformation really driven 've restructured force . 've noted , 's herculean change management effort . thankfully able deliver pretty strong result time . covid hit , judson . 'm sure ended stressing everything built . maybe could elaborate little bit commercial enterprise smb sale motion suddenly changed covid , besides obvious sale executive rep working home . covid stressed sale motion microsoft ? - karl keirsteadyes . look , think 's put pressure u , frankly , karl . would say first , feel privileged industry , frankly , one ﬂick switch pretty well-run business remotely . build product remotely . service customer remotely . collaborate effectively organization remotely . consider lucky . way business shaped throughout , , pretty strong throughout basically enablers remote digital work right . say position humility , look , , much stressed industry right , stressed segment . think look area see blemish business , 's downstream , 's stressed customer . 're super respectful continue hope strong recovery get pandemic condition . said , precise answer question , look , folk stressed end spectrum , rolling remote work service , voice/video capability , persistent chat , collaboration tool , security requirement digitize everyone 's work environment , inherently make vulnerable cyber-crime . sadly , bad actor slowed pandemic . 've operated opportunistically . kept security folk pin needle , working customer proactively reactively throughout . effectively enabling remote everything , remote customer engagement , remote factory operation . internal operation become 100 % digital , much alluded digital pillar . first built , build infrastructure tool capability could call breadth market mid-market customer smb , effectively selling digital selling . 's pretty cool way work . mean , queue demand signal digital marketing effort . folk work digital sale organization basically get queue 100 phone call make given day . cognitive reasoning service tell call first , handle objection . sentiment analysis call customer allow u record . know well 're well 're tracking towards meeting need . 've blessed . 're turning around helping customer technology microsoft us internally one sell externally . got . judson , communicating army sale folk timing return normal , call , pre-pandemic sale motion , ﬂying dining , back oﬃce ? 's internal microsoft messaging likely happen ? 's important giant like microsoft start returning normal , cue term , broadly speaking , might enter recovery scenario . 'm curious 're . - judson althoff - karl keirstead - judson althoff yes . 's great question . look , first foremost , working government around world adhere local law policy , , microsoft operates 150 country . 's one return-to-work moment return workplace moment , multiple . could customer singapore , india meeting face-to-face microsoft counterpart managing public health requirement locally accordance policy land . headquarters environment redmond , washington , 've stated open corporate campus normal operation july . 've given employee kind notification continue prepare remote work environment . interestingly enough , coming , though , 's fascinating data science problem . beauty 've built microsoft 365 platform , team interface many people use enterprise , sits top elaborate graph database could mash system record . like 're sale , would mash productivity data sale result . 're engineering , would mash productivity code check-in check-out . actually measure 80 % folk productive pre -- pre-pandemic . use data rethink corporate travel , rethink corporate real estate . 're encouraging customer . cool part , said , data-driven make decision . yes . 's super helpful , judson . maybe 'd love ask question customer conversation 're day , environment feel like . maybe 'll open general question large enterprise spending priority changed since covid . think 's pretty obvious initial month two much enabling remote access . microsoft obviously saw team usage spike , et cetera . passage eight month , , judson , november , december ? feel like key priority big customer preparing 2021 ? yes . 'd say two thing really different pre-pandemic overall sense urgency agility ruthlessness every investment need come back impactful outcome , right ? look , good ceo pre-pandemic would saying , `` hey , look , newsﬂash , judson , two thing super important time , pandemic . '' criticality , think , everyone face right placing increased focus two - karl keirsteaddimensions . 's certainly lot energy go faster ? make sure everything impactful ? frivolity anything interesting nice often cast wayside . one thing 's clear technology seen answer pretty well question asked modernize . like looked remotely good get data center pre-pandemic , look really good get data center . looked interesting digitize process , factory automation scenario , connect ot capability iot simulate improve manufacturing scenario , looked remotely interesting pre- pandemic , look , interesting , frankly , 's way operate . 's way produce good scale . 're seeing really increased focus effort . people extraordinarily busy helping customer across really three primary dimension , would say , karl . one notion back-end digital twinning call , modeling data machine learning business process modeled automated done lights-out capacity , whether factory curbside pickup optimization model , huge body work building product running process digital , lights-out capacity . second category bit mentioned term microsoft's internal use digital selling support . , always say , 're engaging customer omnichannel capacity today , 're probably engaging . 's much case bulk work 're , whether proactive reactive handling customer engagement , largely data-driven effort achieve . category one mentioned moment ago , productivity employee base empowerment employee base modern asset measuring analytically using insight service . sort three category , 've added intensity increased agility impact bottom line result . got . maybe , judson , 'll hit little bit one driver around getting data center faster would obviously significant positive party microsoft suite , 're aware , tech investor put undue focus , azure , given central satya rest team . judson , think evolution , post-covid , big enterprise stepping back , deciding need change on-prem/cloud mix , make cloud ? planning , whiteboarding phase . gone little bit faster actually made deal commitment azure amazon whomever . third step deal actually going live way consumes compute/storage resource , outside actually - judson althoffsee form azure revenue . journey ? would help frame azure outlook might look like . yes . sort liken thing sporting event . would say 're hockey fan , three-period game , 'd say 're probably entering first intermission , sort end first period , . would say way sort justify explanation follows . first mover moved . first mover actually starting recognize scale result associated investment 've made . e- commerce platform today amazon ecosystem , 're likely running asset azure today 're seeing result . 're seeing pan term top line revenue ability scale enormously . seeing customer move early realizing gain impact promise cloud transformation . also ton learning associated first period . 's kind use intermission term , , little bit , okay , maddening crazy intense . learn ? advising client moving forward ? thing like enterprise control plane audit security capability effectively allow customer gracefully look transformation actually even look hybrid computing end state rather -- 're sort step along way journey . hybrid becoming architecture 's stay , good u look microsoft , 've hybrid hybrid cool even called hybrid . lot work going today . would say term look future growth coming , we're point 's consultative way 're engaging customer right , based learning , excite u portfolio unique differentiation around sort second third chapter growth cloud . start probably le obvious bit advice extend customer day , : hey , look . 's probably chunk application portfolio n't move cloud . , big purveyor cloud platform , go , `` well , seems counterintuitive , judson . '' reality situation , look business process evolving come back notion technology always servant business , application obsolescence letting go asset important pressure point opening economic ﬂywheel future innovation . - karl keirstead - judson althofffrom , 's also portion portfolio lifted shifted modernized per se , rather thought term new low-code , no- code capability infusing way people frontline work . team , ability integrate low-code , no-code technology call power apps end user actually hand designing workﬂow process use complete task every day . serf productively far better taking old school legacy , bespoke application simply moving cloud . look , application n't inspire productivity ran data center , 's going better running . rethink low-code , no-code capability , modernized ui team , super helpful . also look dynamic portfolio way offering first-party saas application obsolesce legacy technology much lower cost . 's massive third-party ecosystem saas offering , certainly compete microsoft biz apps layer also work cloud platform . 's modern app dev revolution well , pro-dev revolution . 's biggest reason acquired github 're seeing tremendous amount momentum realm . 's data analytics estate really help customer get order 's foundation innovation cybersecurity play . 's seven element consultative , methodical plan help customer focus accelerate progress . 's actually quite differentiated relative approach asset value bring discussion . make sense . appreciate hockey analogy . 're talking canadian , judson , hit home . 've got two question related azure . one , term microsoft's competitiveness relative aws google cloud , think covid crisis change enterprise priority way changed competitive dynamic among big three cloud infrastructure vendor ? lent advantage microsoft way worth calling group today ? yes . look , think fact microsoft trusted relationship customer long time helped . 's certainly mindset customer 's fair bit microsoft infrastructure place historically . pressured upper management say , `` hey , listen . need go cloud , need go cloud . whichever direction thought headed , please go faster , '' beneficial u . - karl keirstead - judson althoffi think investment 've made hybrid capability also help becomes zero-sum decision . word , 's cloud data center . logical conclusion say 's balance two . think focus helped . investment 've made data service extend may existing sql server investment u cloud , also helping journey . governance model . microsoft 45-year- old company , 've transformation , right ? result , built lot governance capability fortune 500 company need think kind transformation . offering back customer , think , hugely beneficial . got . maybe , judson , maybe continue discussion little bit . way investor think server product category amy mike disclosed often viewed sort ﬂip side azure , big organization reduce on-premise footprint migrate workload azure , gain , might lose little bit product like window server sql server database on-premise . think way ? manage on-premise server product bucket ensure stay resilient large customer like ubs migrate aggressively cloud ? yes , 's great question . 'd say top line answer , karl , look , 're customer- focused term outcome 're trying achieve . result , , course , shift on-prem cloud , right ? 're trying artificially dictate . word , 's on-prem meter inside microsoft say , `` whoa , whoa , whoa . let 's accelerate cloud fast 's going shift business model . '' want go fast customer want go . inherently , shift , socket per socket , workload per workload . word , on-prem workload ran certain number window server sql server license data center moving cloud moving workload cloud , , course , shift . stated , mentioned earlier hybrid compute architecture stay , let give little bit example actually think 's tam-expansive . 's 100 % shift , rather tam-expansive . satya long time talked intelligent edge , intelligent cloud . latter , think pretty well understood . former , certainly confusing first uttered . people like , `` heck edge ? mean ? '' people , think understood edge talked cell phone pocket maybe even wearable maybe get head around iot center . increasingly , 're putting ability compute scale reason scale edge . 're increasingly making reality customer . - karl keirstead - judson althoff - karl keirsteadso look announcement 've made 5g azure stack capability , scenario reasoning edge compute edge deciding round-trip cloud model propagation make lot sense customer , whether addressing precision agriculture , idea ubiquitous connectivity farm reality , whether factory operation location want private 5g network , right ? able reason edge important part compute architecture moving forward . obviously , look outside u.s. , data sovereignty , data residency concern propagate need edge would defense intelligence scenario need dictate . 'll see , course , growth cloud organically . 'll see shifting on-premise state workload-by- workload socket basis . also see tam-expansive movement edge compute scenario . hopefully ... hey , judson , might unfair ask quantify . think hybrid mean on-premise , cloud , edge , think five ten year mix typical large enterprise spend might , able bracket essentially end state might look like , call , ten year ? challenging task ? 's super hard , let explain 'm genuinely trying avoid question . 'd love yard stick meter . get belief opportunity clearer total sum high-tech industry opportunity defined today . much notion digital cog moving forward . idea , somehow , inside kroger grocery store compute capability 're serving ad shelf edge 're engaging customer on-the-spot promotion they're walking store part cog environment exist today , except kroger example , exist scale . see retail environment become truly digitized truly omnichannel , see factory become digitized . number factory planet full-on digital twin simulate operation infinite scale , drive carbon , drive cost , drive water consumption , 's probably le 2 % world 's factory today . edge expansion , tam expansion pretty material right bulk way world 's industrial company operate today nondigitized capacity . continue learn applicability hybrid intelligent edge scenario , go expansive nature tam . - judson althoffgot . maybe last broadly demand question 'd love ask , judson . clearly , microsoft , big enterprise software firm , drive huge portion revenue larger enterprise like ubs . microsoft particular long tail smb big microsoft customer well . , unfortunately economic crisis , -- tail hurt . amy candid last several microsoft call , smb sector dragged growth little bit . 'm wondering could address microsoft sale organization dealing smb segment . anything sale go-to- market motion sort bring back ? function , frankly , waiting economy improve getting snapback customer segment ? yes . 's good one . -- think first thing start smb , right ? mean , smb sort -- segment segment . 's important -- think always start basis understanding microsoft competes commercial frame , frankly , n't extension consumer base anything else . think smb , small smb , look , bulk commercial revenue derived outside . think company zero ten term employee , look , mentioned earlier , humbly stated stated position privilege , folk going lot right . lot empathy customer experiencing . piece business look lot like consumer business , though , commercial enterprise business . whilst smb may compressed , 're actually seeing pretty decent growth outside smb , largely , , thought good idea digitize business pre-pandemic , 's imperative . business 100 % resilient , digital business resilient . took drive street look small business open , 's largely figured delivery . 've figured relationship doordashes world . 've figured way stay engaged customer make employee continue work safely remotely . closed shop . , deliberate caution notion privilege , 're purveyor make possible . , course , discounting quite bit support , keeping entity aﬂoat . continue get pandemic come side , expect sector business thrive . 's -- like said , growing today , maybe growing quite used pre-pandemic , we're bullish future . - karl keirstead - judson althoff - karl keirstead got . judson , 've talked little bit azure , key microsoft story , product 's quite central satya talking lot 's also increasingly conversation team . maybe 'd love ask , judson , two thing . one team central microsoft ? secondly , timely question , 's interpretation salesforce- slack merger might mean team growth going forward . yes . great question . love team . love team , think , reason understand . think people get largely team equal slack plus zoom . team voice video capability persistent chat , sharing capability inherent slack zoom combine two together . love , frankly , love team far . actually believe team ux user experience future . team way people want work . 's team . 's integrate team potential effectively new window u . team cross-platform , completely open . run form factor usability mobile form factor pc-class , large-screen form factor , growing materially . 're bullish . like app store rating team app chart term quality . , combined third-party application well call low-code , no-code capability , power apps power platform , creates new surface area call citizen developer . person carry mobile device around go , `` wow , climb telephone pole electric pole service utility , afterwards , somehow write notebook perhaps somebody transport excel document . gosh , 'm savvy enough make powerpoint presentation , 'm savvy enough make simple app dock team environment digitize way work . '' citizen dev movement something cheering , helping propagate materially think team become end user compute platform future . think 's pretty differentiated . slack acquisition salesforce , give credit , intelligent thing persistent chat becoming modality . think 're going crm application , salesforce 's core , n't chat capability would arcane . slack asset help modality business application platform make sense , much 's exactly 've couple year team dynamic offering hundred third-party application , well , like said , 's no-code , low-code capability inherent citizen dev movement . - judson althoff - karl keirstead - judson althoff - karl keirsteadgot . muscular slack salesforce umbrella , resource , ability upsold salesforce base , , judson , make formidable rival collaboration space ? yes . certainly make -- make asset modernized think . sale cloud user marketing cloud user service cloud user slack becomes integrated environment , make asset stickier , certainly dynamic front , strengthens competitive dynamic offering . productivity play standpoint , salesforce really n't broad-scale productivity offering . would offer -- probably judson opinion microsoft opinion per se , offer broadly actually distraction take -- like salesforce going kind sale pursuit 're driving workplace modernization employee empowerment effort customer . okay . judson , n't much time question , get one perfect segue conversation ask . -- 'll read loud . see microsoft getting directly involved enterprise telephony ? continue lean heavily carrier ucaas partner going forward ? yes , 's good question . n't see zero sum , quite frankly . great partnership telco provider around world . actually see relationship strengthening . look take network asset cloud modernize , platform actually becomes plumbing telco operate . certainly edge cloud paradigm described earlier , telco essential . voice video payload something perfect team , telco know . 's microsoft thing , frankly . 's whether use cisco webex whether use zoom bluejeans thing today , idea somehow 's going telco offering versus something come top market reality . think telco see , 're looking monetize outside core end-user experience . look , 's successful team strategy microsoft strategy excludes telco . fact , see need even stronger partnership moving forward . - judson althoff - karl keirstead - judson althoff - karl keirstead - judson althoffgot . time one , 'll sneak one . completely different question , judson , keep toe . investor asking whether microsoft plan create chip compete apple 's m1 chip , matter , aws produce chip use azure vms ? well , yes . hand chip design already xbox . xcloud offering actually interesting one 're pretty excited . gaming ecosystem one crossover realm consumer commercial 's super exciting u high-growth area business . ca n't comment 'll space . apple 's move certainly interesting one . 're studying . partnership , though , realm , open ai effort relationship intel arm development certainly point need advanced capability . whether build first-party ecosystem third-party partner sort yet disclosed . excellent . judson , n't end ? thank , mike spencer ir team agreeing keynote event spend much time client . behalf ubs , judson , thanks much carving time today u . thanks , karl . pleasure . okay . bye-bye . thank . bye .
