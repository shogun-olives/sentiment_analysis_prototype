'm going leave ﬂoor david schubmehl , going talk little bit research practice idc . thank , anurag . good morning , folk . wanted talk today cognitive software ai software general , specifically ibm watson we'll starting talking attribute cognitive software . think software around 20 25 year , 30 year around responds essentially set algorithm . 're talking today term cognitive ai software , software n't necessarily need programmed ; system actually learn 've seen many discussion . people talk deep learning ; talk machine intelligence ; talk artificial intelligence general term ; essentially synonym cognitive software technology . technology support slide . example , handle lot unstructured information . handle audio information textual information , natural language processing . case , 're actually right , software generate human readable sentence paragraph , 's natural language generation . mentioned machine learning component already , system actually learns essentially modifies algorithm time using different type algorithm . pattern recognition automated analytics predictive capability part cognitive software technology . time , lot technology evolve . 's thing like image analytics , idea able understand semantics able interpret people actually saying 're saying , want able actually understand create hypothesis prediction ; 's really understanding various sens people looking . 've got sensory input processing also emotion recognition well . take look ecosystem , -- way idc look component talked previously . dialog management ; apis , text analytics , speech recognition , component . component usually put together cognitive ai software platform . tool like ibm watson tool , wipro 's holmes ; tc ignio ; salesforce 's einstein , platform people actually using develop artificial intelligence application . around white circle around content data . think one reason include circle application inherently statistically driven . based data . action , prediction , recommendation based data 's fed system . 's important content data feeding system would correct available , combination first-party third-party possibly second-party data , consideration need go . thing 's important data become integral component cognitive ai solution , 'll get little talk ibm strategy . actually market third-party data 's beginning emerge , part kind application . last least , different type application . process application cognitively enabled . -- 're seeing sale . 're seeing finance . 're also seeing industry application around able help healthcare term improving patient outcome ; able money laundering ; able come right price particular product . 're seeing business-to-business service term advertising , legal system , commercial leasing , know , application -- tool like airbnb uber using disrupt industry based kind cognitive ai type solution . , last least cognitively enabled consumer service product ; 're seeing wealth come marketplace . everything retail system help pick choose , kind coat want wear , able help identify , best place travel best price , kind thing becoming call cognitively enabled . look popular used case , 're seeing obviously healthcare manufacturing , finance , government retail popular used case 're seeing . term idc 's cognitive spending guide research , 're seeing finance one advanced area , people spending money initially ; 're seeing healthcare following closely ; retail right . manufacturing government little bit behind , think , we're seeing opportunity really -- entire gamut cognitive application running industry running different used case . almost everything think term software going cognitively enabled point ; 's probably near future i.e. , next 5 10 year . term ibm watson , -- asked anurag kind ibm watson ? well , 's really technology platform . definition 's technology platform us natural language processing machine learning reveal insight large amount unstructured data really get heart 're talking . taking sensory input , taking text , taking different type data making sense able help , augment improve worker ' decision prediction based data . component ibm watson portfolio ? well , first foremost watson developer cloud . ibm set 2013 ; 've got 100,000 developer hundred partner . addition , also venture capital fund , funding various partner ; also providing seed money help company innovative idea make use watson developer tool . -- number tool , watson developer cloud available via bluemix . people get access easily start working . 's one primary area watson developer cloud . time , area , watson explorer really search discovery application , includes cognitive ai component ; able help organization find locate information make use information decision-making process . ibm also created number watson business unit . watson iot , looking combining cognitive ai technology iot urgence iot area 's growing . 've also created watson health acquiring large number company combining healthcare aspect cognitive ai technology . area ibm -- since watson first got started jeopardy 's challenge . watson solution cancer diagnosis cancer care based data coming sloan memorial kettering . time , watson also creating new business unit ; recently made announcement 're going acquire promontory group , around financial compliance . think 's safe say 'll probably see watson financial compliance business unit coming near future . time , number tool . watson analytics really ibm's answer try reinvent business analytics workspace make watson analytics tool , cloud-based tool , upload data , start playing , automatically get use predictive modeling predictive discovery able identify different aspect particular data . last least watson solution see , watson engagement advisor , watson discovery advisor , new one called watson conversation able hold conversational user interface ; 're seeing kind thing well . look watson health , watson health really data knowledge . notice , talked minute ago content data important kind application . well , ibm acquiring company lot lot data . merge 30 billion image ; phytel explorys 100 million patient record ; truven 250 million claim record . , 've got generic one , 've got weather company including 3 billion reference point . data . using data concert cognitive application really provides insight around well organization actually make use kind cognitive ai solution . 's combination data cognitive ai solution really help drive stuff market . mentioned watson health insight really driven data . think good example think watson 's different business unit general . 're combining data , 're either acquiring getting partnership . 're taking cognitive ai technology solution ; 're combining two together service aspect really deliver insight company looking term able transform business digital transformation 're starting see marketplace . one question get lot , competitive landscape look like ? well , obviously , left hand side , large number cognitive platform . ibm , upped [ ph ] , obviously company like palantir ; digital reasoning , ipsoft , nuance ; startup like cognitivescale numenta company acquired . intel acquiring saffron technology nervana system . company coming -- consulting company like tata consultancy service infosys wipro , there's wide range competitor marketplace . right hand side company n't actually , would considered cognitive software platform today , apis service ; starting make available people . everybody lockheed saic , getting involved work , fujitsu baidu company like google facebook microsoft amazon , offer different type cognitive api service , would n't really characterize complete platform point time . last least , kind summary , really see , idc see ai changing nature work . recommendation , assistance augmentation term automated advisor really going become norm almost every field . every piece software use going type augmentation recommendation capability . think really kind generation transformation . mean , think idea cognitive ai software combined technology 're seeing market really transforming way people use software next 5 10 year . think turn also transform company business ; 's feel industry structure going changed . take advantage 're going see disruption . mean , people talk airbnb , people talk uber , disrupting inﬂuences . well , one reason 're disrupting inﬂuences 're using cognitive ai machine learning application help drive disruptive business machine learning technology ; ai technology really disrupting component . company standpoint , would recommend happen involved decision-making particular company , really need start thinking application going change business 're going make use application really get jump get edge particular industry . , 'll turn back anurag . anurag rana david schubmehl anurag rana david schubmehl thank much dave comprehensive overview . 'm going make request question feel free ask submitting one area right slide . let start question 'll pas jitendra -- switch back forth . , dave described cognitive science one -- generational transformation sector . among people talk current level awareness ? think people aware . popular press done tremendous job raising issue , think 've also raised lot misunderstanding . think awareness cognitive ai technology coming going able , think fairly common today . n't think common , whether business organization actually thought they're going use cognitive ai technology competitive improve roi improve sale . n't think level thinking really yet taken hold . dave said , mean would advise ceo cio respect early deployment cognitive solution ? mean , start ? focus cost , revenue ? best practice seen far far early deployment cognitive solution concerned ? think 's really interesting . mean , think 're seeing company kind every -- little bit everything . company looking reducing cost , 're seeing financial company , example , looking cognitive ai software fraud investigation -- actually better job quicker job solving . 're starting see people using cognitive ai software cyber security help solve kind problem . 're also seeing organization sea level , 're starting talk cognitive ai technology disrupt business , actually deliver good faster drive new business model cognitive ai hub [ ph ] . term best practice , think , 've asking 've telling people really assessment data-driven organization today . 's data-driven , really need get handle data ? ? ? get third- party source ? data really -- one key component need look . data good handle anurag rana david schubmehl jitendra waral david schubmehlyou 've got quality , start take look , well , could cognitive ai solution begin change mindset ? end user side , 're also seeing , -- everything press around conversational uis , chatbots future . 're seeing lot company starting test water around . right time u maybe take customer service augment conversational ai agent ? ivr system , think replacing ivr system conversational ai agent better job also turnover possibility -- turning customer support call actual sale ? hey , dave , conversation technology software company , think awareness high , everyone brother launching new ai product -- given day . 's kind awareness non-technology company , let 's say , somebody manufacturing area metal mining , mean , 's -- idea 's happening ? oh , yeah , think . mean , look -- look company like example , caterpillar . caterpillar developing autonomous driving mining vehicle last several year term able reduce cost thing like . john deere combining cognitive ai software data collection point farm implement actually hit ground try improve farmer ' yield thing like . making tractor farm implement actually delivered data used develop predictive model . think -- think lot lot opportunity sort traditional company . need think kind data kind data -- could develop predictive model could develop recommendation system , would potentially change business opportunity ? dave , go strategy company ibm ? mean , everybody else pitching ai solution , obviously google top hill deepmind acquisition application 're back . -- -- differentiation ibm watson ? think differentiation something last longer -- longer term given competition in-store [ ph ] ? anurag rana david schubmehl jitendra waralwell , mean , think , look google approached , mean , google approaching consumer standpoint part . think recently announced 're going add google horizon forget name new product , 're adding ai component google work product . 've focusing embedding cognitive capability product necessarily creating complete enterprise platform building cognitive ai solution . think 's changing , google develops machine learning service apis , think 're going get marketplace . think , ibm -- pretty big head start particular area . way , microsoft developing ai technology long time ai technology embedded inside sharepoint , microsoft delve product really offer kind capability . cognitive service , microsoft cognitive service , would -- characterize mature ibm watson technology . sense think , ibm head start . also think ibm thinking longer transformational process involving cognitive ai system company . think microsoft , satya nadella talked important ai year's ignite everything going transformed ai . think 's great think 's , ceo ibm talking 2.5 year ago . think head start ibm folk -- based watson technology approach business . fair enough , dave . dave , actually look cloud business different company , whether 's amazon web service microsoft , leader time . , watson help ibm 's cloud strategy ? mean , think help cloud strategy term able make ai component available via cloud . think , 've done lot term delivering watson developer service , part bluemix platform ; think that's helped advance usage popularity bluemix platform . think standpoint , think 's -- 's win-win situation term fact cognitive ai service they're making available via bluemix . 's great . talk like -- -- think market size obviously impact seems widespread , david schubmehl - anurag rana - david schubmehlhow size market ? look much worth guy monetize ? -- yeah , mean , 're sizing couple different way . one , part spending guide research , 're looking spend available . term software side , mean , well , actually multiple different technology . 's obviously hardware side 're seeing increase gpus ; 're seeing increase compute power coming different folk . software side , see -- kind two differentiation ; one cognitive software platform -- 've talked , business 's going grow quickly , 's tool business , right . opposed cognitively enabled application business , really , 'm going add ai piece enterprise software 'm going develop new piece software something ; 's going cognitively enabled . see total -- technology something like $ 30 billion business -- $ 30 billion opportunity 20 -- think 2019 right 've got . growth rate something order 50 % 55 % cagr , compound annual growth rate type application . , one thing 'm going caution people 're also seeing enterprise software company adding ai component standard enterprise software ; case , 're probably going charge . example , version sharepoint includes delve technology talked , n't cost regular sharepoint . 's part package . 're going see percentage application actually going embed ai functionality ; 's going additional revenue software vendor , help sell copy package . particular case , wo n't count -- ai revenue cognitive software revenue , 'll count erp revenue crm revenue . question answer thanks , dave . dave , question audience . first one , specific ai company healthcare would highlight ahead curve ? mean , number watson partner people . mean , 'm really expert healthcare area . mean , company - anurag rana - david schubmehl - anurag rana - david schubmehl - jitendra warallike modernizing medicine thought quite innovative based partnership ibm . company interesting thing health insight group probably people ask specifically healthcare environment . great . next question could discus extent watson -- used fight cyber-crimes attack ? -- n't believe announcement ibm watson term cyber security thing yet . 'm really -- 's particular area , n't -- 'm really aware . watson used really fraud analytics compliance analytics 're seeing place . think also work going ibm watson dod work thing like 're really aware oﬃcially , think 's safe bet ibm working closely federal government try -- try analyze understand different type threat . great . one -- another one , business -- think , business risk obsolete cognitive computer replaces service . look list , area come first mind ? well , mean , think -- think people need thinking different type technology going changed impacted . think fact may cognitive ai program available need record management software , need content management software , smart agent automatically finding information providing information regular basis . think -- think , certain category software potentially risk , automated solution available . think -- one thing 've talking marketing automation counterpart idc , future marketing ? given may ai based assistance future onto phone onto pc actually helping filter information , going filter ad ? going filter marketing tent ? intermediation automated agent going work vendor marketing agent ? 's intermediation going look like ? advertising potentially go away least sense know today , term targeting thing like ? think interesting question . going change landscape people consume information ? - david schubmehl - anurag rana - david schubmehlthanks , dave . 've brieﬂy touched automated advisor , evolution curve ? mean , look consumer application facebook trying pilot chatbots . -- example work ; n't . far term automated advisor ready prime time ? mean , think -- think 's early day , right . mean , think 're starting see everybody continuing push . mean microsoft 's cortana google assistant , apple siri , phone based one continue get smarter . think question , something 's intimately tied phone , vendor going somebody provide kind general purpose assistant really becomes advisor pay kind automated advisor like x.ai help schedule personal assistant technology . think form factor kind grab right . question , get data ? obviously , consumer would like data . right , use google assistant , use gmail , data read google try improve thing , also improves targeting marketing . apple owns data , 're using apple iphone siri . mean , say 's , obviously interaction . , obviously microsoft boat , us -- use cortana , certain thing 's going aware . question owns data ? responsible data ? -- go look data work data ? going want third-party ai advisor going want one that's based phone free . think thing kind yet determined . think extent , think everybody stepwise improvement automated advisor area something really take hold consumer . dave , thanks . dave , let ask last question ; wrap . one thing talk quite bit buying data everybody data going important ; obviously microsoft bought linkedin heard lot salesforce trying say -- might get access something like . , going become bigger issue ? example ibm road say well , going give data let 's say asset weather company anybody else become kind anti-competitive thing going forward ? n't -- think company like microsoft buying linkedin data ibm buying weather company , think -- think business model right include - anurag ranasharing data third party . think everybody would -- started hold data say would n't share . think obviously world's government would folk , fact , 's -- extent 's already happening . believe 're going see land grab continue company trying acquire data access data data process data integration capability ; 're going first foremost . think ibm continue look good acquisition data like weather company , like merge , think microsoft going thing linkedin . salesforce couple year ago data.com . think lot lot opportunity . mean , oracle something similar oracle data cloud , company bought bluekai bought company 've integrated real data provider . believe -- 's going increased competition data company ; would n't bit surprised large data company get acquired software technology company next 12 36 month . great . dave , thank much behalf bloomberg intelligence team -- help . access research terminal . jitendra done comprehensive report artificial intelligence . please email u , need copy report ; send . , thanks time great day .
