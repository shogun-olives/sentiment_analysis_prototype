hey . good morning , everyone . welcome bloomberg intelligence webinar series . topic today understanding risk due covid-19 . couple administrative note u . today 's presentation recorded available playback . access replay via link sent email bloomberg webinars . bottom slide window , adjust volume maximize screen . ask question , one right-hand side . address question conclusion presentation . quick word bloomberg intelligence . provide in-depth research data company , industry , government , credit , esg . cover close 2,000 company right 300 people part department established globally . discussion today covid-19 rising cybersecurity risk . guest today nanda santhana , pas introduce talk little bit 're seeing market space . anurag [ ph ] . hope everybody hear , okay . name nanda santhana , run global head cybersecurity threat solution securonix , 'm going first walk guy little bit securonix . company founded 2009. 250 customer worldwide couple product produce today next-gen siem , built cloud . also offer security data lake , essentially help customer gather data cloud ueba solution , user entity behavior analytics solution . also provide soar solution , security , orchestration response . 've around 2009 , product suite produce . term topic hand today , like brought anurag , hundred million people working home result ongoing covid-19 outbreak . challenge see number one , vpn , remote access , cloud anurag rana nanda santhanabyod device opened overnight employee contractor , right . especially , vpn collaboration tool pushed maximum bandwidth . basically mean kid home . lot virtual schooling 's happening . home , bandwidth completely consumed . corporate network side , folk using lot video conferencing . bandwidth completely full . organization , started expedite cloud adoption , especially coronavirus covid-19 pandemic , , folk work home . overnight shifted towards using cloud email , infrastructure apps little security testing even time taking assessment using cloud solution . change 's happening side . attacker side house , hacker absolutely merciless . 're taking advantage fact fear across globe capitalizing fear , speak little bit 're speak . thing happening , see enormous high number spray spear phishing campaign , spray spear phishing campaign essentially targeting individual specific class key message , talk cure word like , covid-19 cure phishing event absolutely successful . last thing notice , often time cybersecurity world really talked , damage , unintentional data loss done employee contractor . remember beginning , said bandwidth completely utilized , bandwidth completely utilized , see employee contractor essentially downloading lot sensitive data . right , may look like 's -- usual . 's going happen -- data document big question mark post pandemic . net- net , user laptop , way see new perimeter need monitored respect covid-19 challenge . thing 'll bring . yeah , go ahead anurag , sorry . , nanda , go ahead , please . trying figure attacker -- 's profile ? yeah , definitely . yeah , think attacker see first , traditional malware family also see anurag see lot employee ' contractor , also put attacker ' bracket , u , damage -- cybersecurity damage done organization whether 's adversary outside employee contractor , scenario , even saw terminated employee . essentially 's constitutes towards entire metric starting gather across engagement . , second question , break thing . think key thing see , reason , think pdf entire excel spreadsheet got converted pdf , lost metric , speak . biggest challenge see , see ton phishing campaign , 's rise sure . , like said , extremely crafty message hacker using attack individual 's definitely rise . second big bracket see issue happening outside , malwares essentially last three four week , see close 72,000 domain created either word like corona covid-19 variation start k whatnot . research -- securonix spread research show least 8,000 malicious , also see many top domain meaning , rest domain potentially could used later malicious activity . unfortunately metric showing clearly , we'll get back listener . dig little bit deeper attack vector previous point , see notorious coronavirus malware , right . malware domain registered earlier jan see lot covid covid-19 related domain , like said . , particular coronavirus tracker website , front end , look like -- like john hopkins university 's tracker , back end , 's 's essentially installing malware laptop user n't even realize . , domain continuing become big challenge especially employee , contractor currently working home , reason 's becoming challenge firewall rule user work within organization . degree preventive control . 're working home , 're using byod device , 's becoming much easier attacker essentially trick employee contractor click website 's continuing become challenge . moving , couple key thing want bring threat researcher . guy probably must heard word called ransomware . really rise , seen one organization , covid-19 document look like covid-19 weaponized document . one organization , unfortunately human resource executive click , lock computer , essentially asks sort monetary transaction via bitcoin , ransomwares starting become big challenge organization , especially right , guy probably must seen news , big issue one european hospital , actually ransomware critical clinical system started create big ( inaudible ) institution essentially fix already dealing important thing hand , right . third thing 'll talk probably applies everybody zoom attack . think something definitely want double-click move along . everybody using zoom today think , zoom starting address security concern , seen already lot automated tool actually find meeting id lot academia , lot virtual schooling hacked via method , folk joined random meeting , lot privacy concern started showing , importantly , research dark web , see close 500,000 account dark web . recommendation i'll follow end basically make sure n't become victim , zoom attack , social medium collaboration tool attack definitely raise . talked phishing campaign . one key challenge see respect phishing , message tuned 's going market today , like one scenario , one organization , actually got fixed cdc [ ph ] phishing look phishing email , able bring malware threat research lab essentially detonated . interesting , actually click link , show fake one drive log one drive long exactly look like authentic one drive log , essentially hacker collecting credential 're sending -- 're using whatever malicious reason . particular scenario , soon hacker got access user account credential , started forward significant gmail -- significant email unknown gmail account . couple scenario , real finding , real problem coronavirus work home really brought light . one organization , see , ca n't compromise . 's interesting , see employee logging different part world , especially right travel ban n't expect employee coming different part europe united state america within 5 10 minute . call land speed violation . previously , folk probably would take plane different part world . home computer still connected corporate network , used throw people never got lot attention . start looking analyzing data point , one particular scenario , saw employee , logging many different part world simultaneously actually interesting security operation team , folk actually investigate violation , incident , extra edge investigate , especially travel ban , like said , start seeing several people logging different part world continues , big challenge . talked phishing campaign , think see several phishing campaign . one thing tell attacker , keen direct monetization victim , scenario , actually attack instance , use credential start phishing organization , user , employee contractor get much bigger plot , plot 's much thicker directly attack , pay ransom release computer back , day behind u . extent , one particular scenario , weaponized document , actually run lot malicious process process connecting across different part kind interesting see phishing campaign turned . last thing 'll -- couple thing want touch cybersecurity space talk bad thing , talk attacker hacker , often associate malware group . often associate hacktivist , right . n't see possible damage insider insider somebody part organization , employee contractor . damage could , nine 10 time , could unintentional , problem 's still significant damage organization odds , 'll tell ? employee contractor associated critical project organization standpoint , work , material create . often false sense belonging thinking document , research work belongs , employee contractor , feel entitled take data go next job seek think 's okay take data . nine 10 time , deem insider cybersecurity space employee contractor typically intention unintentional , time , seen sort corporate espionage industry nation-state espionage see . mostly , brand unintentional . reason bring especially right work home , challenge see huge . one organization , first week march , organization announced mandatory work home , within 24 hour 48 hour , security team organization , relax cybersecurity control . release cybersecurity control employee contractor home could n't keep connection , vpn remote network connection , bandwidth full . every five minute , connection kept dropping really started hurt business continuity ( inaudible ) , really started hurt folk regular day-to-day job . security team decided 'm going drop control folk little bit discretionary control sensitive document . ended happening one employee , start grant access personal account corporate share drive . march 20th , employee quits , furthermore 25th march , organization typically . soon somebody quits , disable access . employee put backdoor account personal account , starting continue login , 's actually working competitor organization continues login . start download sensitive data . 's starting download peer , colleague sensitive data 's deep-rooted backdoor entry . , go back challenge coronavirus , covid-19 , work home phase going , key finding want bring . said , couple key takeaway want definitely bring call , right . first thing 'll talk traditional cybersecurity way business different right . user laptop , new perimeter , used inside organization , employee , contractor , outside , 're working home . think boundary know completely stretched , new perimeter user laptop , folk also using byod bring device , 're using personal device connect corporate network . first thing 'll talk , think traditional way monitoring need change , need monitor user behavior monitoring whether 's phishing email , whether hacker bad domain high number sensitive data 's downloaded . common denominator employee contractor , user common denominator amongst attack . monitoring user workstation absolutely critical . third thing 'll tell go outside corporate organization , big request folk listening call , please update software application , update application owner vendor providing , reason . take look note , see security vulnerability patched , strongly recommend everyone update zoom collaborative tool . way zoom -- produced 101 best practice , n't use personal id , use lock room whatnot . absolutely critical , also let kid , teacher know home schooling , definitely something tracking closely . business continuity perspective , think emergency contact important , one particular scenario , employee distracted today . take care kid , take run home work sort secondary person emergency contact support , especially infrastructure mission-critical application whatnot , think bcp plan place definitely key takeaway . scenario , also strongly recommend organization extend endpoint . endpoint essentially small application run laptop detects suspicious activity , detects suspicious malwares virus computer , report back . think lot vendor today providing including u , 're providing sort specialized package help community , recommendation make sure key monitoring place , whether 's endpoint whether 's email need monitor even cloud solution . think monitoring place collecting log absolutely key . thing 'll quickly touch , one organization , actual scammer , impersonated one employee close getting lot sensitive data scammer also know fact workforce working home . train service team member , train customer service team member multiple layer challenge response absolutely make sure person calling end actually person claiming person . sort multiple response framework absolutely required , n't fall scammer . -- last least , confidential data still confidential . today folk taking document . reason justified . bandwidth q - anurag rana - nanda santhana q - anurag ranagetting clogged , data loss , whatnot . whole pandemic gone . inventory document gone , think going , big challenge organization post pandemic time . question answer right , great . nanda , thank much . fairly comprehensive overview stuff 're seeing . request listener . question please put 'll start addressing come . nanda bunch thing mind stuff seeing research well . first foremost , byod question . question audience talking , core risk working home , byod ? company issued asset -- company decides give laptop desktop , reason threat level different pre-covid , give actual hardware asset , would built-in security , n't cover lot risk start people working home laptop ? yeah . think 's great question , right . key problem whether 's byod corporate asset folk sending . challenge actually see folk working home , lot different loophole . 'll tell , organization , soon step , bring corporate asset home network , 've seen organization employee actually connect call local cloud storage , firewall rule organization , 's -- 's enforce . easy copy ton ton data personal storage device home . whether byod corporate issued asset , challenge existed even covid-19 . post covid-19 , think problem take u one thing , bandwidth consumption also includes high degree victim respect phishing campaign , right . reason , definitely see challenge employee contractor using byod device , scenario , -- corporate issued asset . tell , yesterday , investigation one organization . folk working home , obviously , kid home schooling . happened whole zoom collaborative tool issue found , organization started react said , going allow zoom anymore . employee started still need kid go home schooling still need multiple laptop . two kid , home schooling , need multiple laptop . organization , also see user disabling security control corporate issued laptop actually adding pressure , vulnerability scenario . - nanda santhana q - anurag rananow make lot sense . let 's talk little bit pre-covid world post covid world . looked security , security product pre-covid world , -- one thing observed client deal whether 's large bank healthcare company retail company , buy many security product sense n't seen embedded either public cloud offering -- unified solution take care lot thing ? ancillary question one big theme talked well last three , four year hybrid infrastructure , think change given happening ? yeah , great question . way cracking little bit , n't know side , anurag . mean , company -- essentially get company many different cybersecurity solution , right post -- pre-covid . break thing , cybersecurity perspective , lot changed last 15 year . used focused compliance function become much bigger program organization ? first foremost threat landscape changed , right . think , much phishing campaign . many different attack -- sophisticated attack . reason attack evolved adversary today , using sophisticated cloud infrastructure , artificial intelligence , ai enabled bot . super advance . one side , threat actor threat landscape super advanced . side , 's like simpler time organization working , something called firewall perimeter punched small hole send email , send -- browse internet corporate network . thing much changed -- landscape changed lot . today opened cloud organization third-party vendor connecting network . given advancement usage cloud application , side , sophisticated threat actor threat technique constantly attacking , top , organization opened byod , mean starting see last two year smishing , phishing gone smishing , sending malicious email sm . 's state living . see result old school technology , focused compliance related scenario , starting get displaced nextgen solution hence see -- may look like 're seeing multiple different vendor cybersecurity space , essentially , 're targeting specific function , detecting specific technique . think -- 's probably see anurag , lot different cybersecurity solution market today . perhaps explain , mean understand larger company diﬃcult move critical application . 'm small mid- sized company , n't go aws microsoft move everything let worry many thing get heterogeneous infrastructure let worry spending - nanda santhana q - anurag rana - nanda santhanasecurity . -- help even company risk involved ? 's great question , right . think , first , company going stick one cloud solution provider . let 's start , right . two reason : , n't want sort advantage . n't want vendor advantage towards price , cost main driver company , first , consider heterogeneous environment , right . big organization probably use top 3 cloud solution provider . needle say , next five six year , 're starting see new trend private cloud , right , lot company really helping organization build private cloud . come may , way see next four five year , data center going completely go away . mean case would probably see legacy old school mainframe completely gone , 's case . top-notch critical financial transaction still happen mainframe . heterogeneous cloud solution , still on- prem data center matter call , private cloud still fancy word expanding data center , right . think organization going face . 's going heterogeneous environment multiple different cloud solution provider little bit data center presence , mission critical one . cloud solution provider provide security built add-on , going focused service 're going providing . still need bigger mothership going get information , hence -- strongly feel sticking one cloud solution provider end security solution provide going answer , anurag , long term . well 's fair point . one area n't touched today 's -- know got lot question privacy . europe , going make thing worse term access different application moving third-party application without sort security , could say scrutiny . think need done come improving privacy across organization one vendor another share data ? yeah , think cloud solution provider today , keen sharing data , right . think privacy going big challenge . organization , one main driver also build private cloud worried data leaving organization exactly reason brought , anurag , privacy main driver . 're trying 're trying see sort analytical work cloud point computation work cloud vendor really specialize . want see data in-house within data center , privacy still big question mark . q - anurag rana - nanda santhana q - anurag rana - nanda santhanathese evolution cloud happened last five six year . thing surfacing . lot regulatory requirement catching privacy angle , right . feel company going , next year . data may probably end staying trend within data center till strong regulatory requirement cloud solution provider able -- sort go certification process extremely cognizant towards privacy concern 'd probably need meet . , think 're going sort , like said , hybrid solution speak . great . another area written lot talked managed security service . company like ibm accenture large practice dedicated area . 's take , see uptake managed cloud -- managed security service next year still see much aggressive embracement product company ? yeah , think trend perspective , managed security solution provider definitely helping especially life science space , manufacturing space , reason simple , right . mean pharmaceutical company , probably want focus , especially time like , want entire workforce work towards one goal . n't want security team focusing , 101 triaging cybersecurity incident . side , managed security service provider done fantastic job term providing repeatable process building team , 're specialized automation , work closely vendor cybersecurity space . reason , definitely see life science , manufacturing even telecom place , 're pivoting towards 101 operation , cybersecurity operation , go towards managed security service mdr stand manage direct response type company . 've outsourced task . house essentially security folk working business . new term hear often frictionless security . 're repurposing existing security professional within organization focus enabling frictionless security le worry security engineering , worry building sort center excellence , , also develop relationship multiple vendor et cetera , n't want manage . sure see big rise managed security service provider , definitely time like right . 's good . bring couple vertical , sense 're seeing last month even past week , industry vertical spending security product , let 's say , couple year ago ? industry came back ? q - anurag rana - nanda santhanayeah , sure . prior covid-19 , financial institution always first adopter , . post covid-19 see space , life science , especially healthcare team , forced invest lot . 'll tell quick interesting story , one organization , coo get email look like another peer hospital coo sending email , 's actually fake email went coo first organization , basically requested sort patient data sort cure whatever going . name looked much similar actual coo second organization , first coo email sensitive data , right . especially right , -- challenge healthcare definitely seeing . point i'm trying make spend cybersecurity standpoint actually getting better . 's getting better life science overall , also starting see manufacturing company ' folk lot intellectual property folk really worried business continuity also spending lot money security product . two vertical see rise outside traditional financial institution . one thing 've talked lot year 's importance machine learning security . oracle talk lot autonomous database self-patching , one thing brought part suggestion recommendation people patch software latest upgrade whatever new patch put , oracle talk lot database . think end day , need security -- need software product pretty much either patch provisioning human basically taken equation ? think bigger concern , anurag , actually patching one piece . patched , meaning , unless first victim , 's really hard organization , developer developing software . shift entire organization industry called making security left , right , meaning , pushing security left . essentially mean every developer develops application cognizant obviously 101 vulnerability exploit -- hacker exploit vulnerability 're working towards making sure address loophole . oftentimes see , whether 's latest magecart carbanak whatever attack family , problem see developer much foresight figuring whatever developed actually potentially could used back door entry attacker come . point 'm trying make , automation organization , cloud service provider , vendor solution focused patching vulnerability . key challenge actually patching go vulnerability , identifying 's 's called zero-day vulnerability , meaning , nobody else discovered . 's challenge . long challenge exists , taking human taking cybersecurity professional going challenge , n't know , sure . q - anurag rana - nanda santhana q - anurag rana - nanda santhana , 's good . last question particular aspect area . term spending pattern , see company across -- whoever client base term different vertical , allocating money like legacy security product new security product seeing broad-based increase security product ? 's like current sense budget talk cio cisos ? yeah , think pre- covid-19 , could definitely see cisos , chief information security oﬃcers . able good play strong role board meeting able brief board one cybersecurity incident exactly bring company reputation perspective term profit organization going get . perspective , overall spend cybersecurity solution gone significantly last three four year . 's definitely trend . post covid-19 . think organization focused towards little bit careful spend . 're really analyzing right , really need 101 compliance -- strictly compliance focused solution need next-gen solution . mean securonix standpoint , done post whole covid-19 scenario , threat model , call threat model essentially detect sophisticated threat , thing completely changed everybody working home . point 'm trying make , right setup completely different . said , think cybersecurity team really focused probably decommissioning legacy solution , focused next-gen solution solving actual problem hand . hear news medium , whole covid work home could possibly wave short-term , 's one-time thing . going wave , 're going expect see user , employee , contractor , third-party vendor continuing work home . really think cybersecurity professional going make change really going spend , tool really going stay stick within organization . think 're making tough decision . early anurag , -- u definitive , definitely think 're going analyze differently really careful spend . nanda , final word . wrap . . think , first , thank webinar . definitely want thank front-line hero . hope everybody safe home . first outside digital world -- washing hand making sure 're continuing whatever cdc advising . big thanks , like said , front- line hero . also want thank bloomberg opportunity inviting . q - anurag rana - nanda santhanasome threat seeing absolutely real , securonix standpoint , ready go package ready offer lot customer prospect , would love take advantage . , thank anurag inviting session . great , thanks . wrap . replay session heard link sent webinar . transcript live terminal . case , question , reach nanda . big thanks nanda . 's one best storyteller know . great . concludes session . thanks , everybody . thank .
