good morning , everybody . 'm tyler radke , co-head software sector citi , welcome day 1 technology conference . 're excited microsoft . although joining zoom , team , see , corey . corey unfortunately run-in covid , hope 're well . , really appreciate ﬂexibility shout av team making work . corey , thanks joining u . question answer ( question answer ) thought maybe could kick . could touch background , experience within microsoft organization . think 've worked number leader year . high level , day- to-day basis ? ( technical diﬃculty ) right . think segment microsoft report investor kind segment look , kind fair say commercial cloud big focus area ? yes , 's right . ( technical diﬃculty ) q - tyler radke - corey sander q - tyler radke - corey sander q - tyler radke 'll throw gaming question , going ask . -- ( technical diﬃculty ) yes . macro environment top mind investor , would love get perspective . obviously 're seeing lens industry massive azure business . would kind compare contrast demand environment 're seeing versus saw beginning year ? yes . 's -- demand remains quite strong . think excited work ( technical diﬃculty ) 've seen across full spectrum sometimes different industry , sort customer 're looking solve , 's typically looking solve problem technology , trying find sort simpler , faster , easier way leverage technology . , either massive digital transformation , able get new learning , new insight drive new business . also optimization , right , able take advantage scalable cloud taking advantage migration on-prem cloud able reduce capex investment may . , opportunity sort look full range service , think , put u good spot able help customer le frequently speak , span consolidating m365 security product leveraging ai ml build new product 're shipping customer even sort optimizing developer resource taking advantage low code , code platform able expand many people develop . way , look resource across customer , span obviously macroeconomic environment , even job market developer market sort ability le . across facet , 'm pretty excited offer . great . maybe could ask question specifically azure . cloud consumption big topic among investor . peer partner work marketplace talked customer optimizing cloud spend . 've seen slowdown cloud consumption , even azure business recent quarter . - corey sanderstalk consumption trend 're seeing azure ? customer approaching managing optimizing cloud spend topic ? yes . think -- mean , general , think conversation customer , first , looking across full microsoft cloud sort looking across capability think spend on- prem way spend cloud way . , think sort azure specifically , also deeply intertwines oﬃce , team , security suite d365 , like mentioned , power platform . , work customer , oftentimes conversation optimal way leverage service , taking account they're already running , service 're already using , consolidating service . , course , reviewing service u understanding 're optimizing across service . , common conversation , 's much focused customer solution 're trying drive . certainly sort optimization hot topic , always context business goal achieved . 's rarely sort optimization sake optimization . , opportunity , differentiation microsoft able put solution together , able put product together , able drive right end state customer . whether sort reduction one side expansion another side sort opportunity sort leverage service perhaps remove point service may increasing overall cost . part , think really exciting role really sort changed work customer , [ ph ] press conversation coming pretty regularly . opportunity shifting le sort vendor much strategic partner . ability sort solve immediate need , also partnering longer-term strategy change , many customer obviously still thinking . change sell , would get part front line judson think selling full microsoft cloud versus selling sort point solution . opportunity , course , customer look full microsoft cloud broad saving versus looking sort point point potential saving therein . also sort change little bit 've built . 's sort new team come sort 've excited build around leveraging combination service solution . , able drive value getting best service spanning left right . opportunity certainly reduces overall spend able take q - tyler radke - corey sander q - tyler radkeadvantage , sometimes frequently improves top line well able create new value putting service together . , think unique opportunity , unique role seller solution thus get sort deep conversation price per core , actually also opportunity really strategic partner customer work goal , strategy service help get . 's , think 're -- breadth service put u better spot conversation drive right outcome customer . great . think number report azure , think last time saw notable slowdown pandemic early 2020. would contrast conversation customer driver slowdown versus 're seeing ? thinking kind trajectory azure throughout rest fiscal year ? yes , absolutely . mean , think slowdown early part pandemic certainly bit knee-jerk reaction , would say . think sort immediate reaction immediate sort taking stock situation , drove quick response change plan necessary . think given , point , sort pretty different conversation macro conversation . , , conversation slightly different u . lot le sort immediate opportunity immediate anxiety , around long-term strategy . benefit stage customer need go ? need happen next 12 month , need happen next 12 year . think conversation becomes much interesting , actually sort , mentioned , drive broader strategic conversation . customer looking necessarily quick fix . 're looking ability partnership able drive longer-term change . that's sort opportunity across microsoft cloud , sell , build , become quite advantageous u partnership customer . 's , think , little bit would equate different . think sort fear initial one , different , think , sort strategic approach 've seen customer today . got . okay . 's helpful . , think 're seeing region , obviously , different part globe different stage cloud transition . data center versus cloud . guess , seeing kind regional performance differ ? region may seeing slowdown macro perspective , prioritizing cloud le ? give u little bit regional commentary context cloud versus on-premise ? - corey sander yes . think , n't -- sort role , n't seen necessarily specific regional shift specific region seeing notably increased slowdown others . one interesting thing sort global business fact many customer global customer , end obviously sort global deployment strategy global deployment enablement . , still see quite bit demand pretty much everywhere world . , think 's interesting . sort , course , macroeconomic environment continues , something u watch . 's notable region shift perspective . say , sort mentioned on-prem point , one big opportunity sort place spend lot time focusing around enabling value customer ' on-premise , right ? way , hybrid edge strategy really focused , good reason customer deploy continue deploy on-prem environment . sort agnostic , think , macroeconomic environment . think benefit really focus team hybrid solution , one . enabling customer operate on-premise environment extension cloud , sort simple policy , simple security control consistency sort on-prem cloud environment . allows sort continue take advantage on-prem investment even sometimes expand on-prem investment without necessarily sacrificing benefit cloud bring . also see lot focus edge part . , separate maybe macro environment , probably aligned industry-specific area see sort edge sort proximity need actually increasing sort define on-prem spend putting sort additional server either storefront . always joke sort server oil rig able sort take advantage cloud power , whether ai , ml solution running analytics edge still take benefit cloud capability behind seat . , , , service like azure arc defender cloud really offer unified support security . last one actually 're seeing on-prem perspective , may sort regional push , frankly , certainly government side . look sort recent announcement microsoft cloud sovereignty , announced couple month ago , focus around enabling government able deploy way make sense , right ? -- certainly , government spend government digitalization rise , exciting . , offering opportunity able take advantage public cloud make sense sovereign capability , policy governance control , also taking advantage on-prem make sense able put sort environment able leverage cloud capability , , like azure arc manage . q - tyler radke - corey sandersso 's one 're seeing little bit , think we'll continue see part , sovereign government-based deployment . certainly , 's region 's sort growing greater interest . certainly , europe hot area type deployment , seeing globally well . yes . think on-prem piece interesting context . mean , also heard michael dell keynote , talked lot edge computing . actually seen really robust on-prem server growth microsoft . 's remained positive territory despite really strong growth azure . guess , kind think steady state growth ? given going hybrid environment going forward ? point , industry like government really investing . kind sustainable rate ? think azure get bigger , business start decline eventually ? mean point , think 's indication necessarily declining . obviously , michael dell talked , n't want disagree . , think 's indication declining . think -- continue see sort customer , 're expanding amount solution digital transformation 're . , 're expanding amount technology digital capability 're purchasing part budget . , certainly mean sort on-prem spend , believe , continue , especially look unique requirement , fact even expand requirement . sort look opportunity , i'll use edge example , -- , focus industry side . look opportunity frontline worker , opportunity around checkout list , storefront , et cetera , 's actually technology that's shipped edge location storefront able drive business drive value end-customers . course , 's retail . span pretty much every industry every business edge become really critical component growth . , think 's going drive lot purchase lot additional sort on-premise spend . certainly , sort sovereignty desire able data server within proximity also continuing see growth . , course , government , 's also industry regulated thus also follow requirement government . 're seeing opportunity . feel like even partnership like dell , opportunity u bring service able support management consistent way , able offer security consistent way . actually one important aspect hybrid consistent security , service like defender cloud sentinel offer level consistency . even bringing cloud service able run on-premise way . something 've invested pretty heavily offer paas service q - tyler radke - corey sandersrun environment on-premises-based solution . think continue see on-prem server usage . think actually , 'll able take advantage customer able take advantage advanced enhanced service capability . great . great . want talk industry moment . maybe starting high level , talk little bit commercial booking strength 've seen last quarter , really , really robust number . guess perspective , product packaging maybe go-to- market tactic helped drive large commercial booking large contract ? think last couple quarter , 've seen north 30 % commercial booking growth pretty tough compare , pretty impressive . kind -- 's driving ? yes , absolutely . mean , think even adding little bit point mentioned earlier , lot around u working customer strategic partner . sort work 're reshaping future digital information . large commercial booking almost never sure conversation , right ? certainly , involve conversation , involve spending priority , ( technical diﬃculty ) development , new business opportunity , new solution built . , , positioning strategic partner allow u broader conversation span full set workload . also go-to-market shift , really focusing , something think judson done amazing work go-to-market perspective sort chief commercial oﬃcer , focusing full microsoft cloud . 's customer want focus one product . go-to-market push , think , driven lot opportunity commercial booking , whether sort combination azure team oﬃce security d365 , 's sort bringing thing together really powerful . drive back engineering . , sort , , think opportunity engineering bring component together , right ? team constantly looking way add value 's product . know sort collection really bringing real value customer put product together solve problem . also maybe add one key point well sort look product look sort sell build , think ﬂexibility well contract really helped , right ? allows customer able use -- commitment wide variety service requirement . , azure commitment allows , course , use azure service , also allows use key partner service like azure databricks azure netapp file . even sort supporting recent announcement power platform integrated directly azure experience offering pay-as-you-go model . type q - tyler radke - corey sandersﬂexibility really quite powerful customer allows , , look forward strategic partnership potential use service able achieve outcome . yes . want hit partner moment , maybe could talk vertical industry , 's title . 's good question . maybe help u understand microsoft 's industry verticalization strategy , 're building product maybe built specifically certain industry 're organizing go-to-market team go sell product industry ? yes , definitely . biggest thing industry strategy around accelerating time value customer . really pivot u company , 've super excited front line . really taking microsoft cloud vision 've talked , bringing sort engineering marketing sale together offer true vertical solution enable company sort unleash value , right ? 's sort changing way approach sort long-standing problem challenge . six industry-specific cloud to-date . include healthcare , retail , financial service , manufacturing , non-profit sustainability . also additional industry work deeply like energy , telco mobility . whole goal behind industry cloud 're sort extensible top horizontal service , right ? allow bring together multiple horizontal service add value solve industry problem . given combination collaboration business apps , course , infrastructure data , great array sort problem-solving solution sometimes need help put together able offer end-to-end value business leader given company industry . 's , think , industry cloud really come . 's also big focus -- know said 'll talk later . wo n't go deep , big focus isvs partner well , able enable partner add industry value directly u end-customers . example sort work 've done get particularly excited . patagonia good example . ended closing sort operation start pandemic , right , keep employee safe . reopen , end using microsoft cloud retail launch new way engage customer . , bringing service together , brought d365 , dynamic 365 team basically create advanced connection point customer offer seamless customer experience could deliver . , included sort distributed order management . sometimes local store , turned sort many warehouse sort bringing together . q - tyler radke - corey sanderssome challenge see retail example sort online business in-person business sort enabling employee continue work also reducing maybe online -- excuse , in-person business support online business . right ? opportunity sort switch quickly tweak thing power added part partnership . course , team used connected across store oﬃces warehouse coming together offer value . another sort good example 'll call company called group bimbo , work 've done sustainability side . sort , , recent ga announced microsoft cloud sustainability . 're familiar group bimbo , international producer big snack good . 'm sure 've sort latin america , 've certainly seen available place . goal use renewable energy eliminate carbon emission waste entirely , course , sort producer good , quite challenging certainly lot truck going around delivering service . , adopted cloud sustainability able collect , track analyze emission , develop solution able reduce understand emission impact basically immediate impact without much extensive training able make change tweak support goal reducing eliminating carbon emission . 's great partnership well . sort example really sort taking technology 've got enabling vertical-based capability solve end business goal , customer really striving solve different based industry based time line . great . wanted ask two industry particular move partner . one 's think topical healthcare , obviously , nuance acquisition . maybe could kind articulate view healthcare industry . expecting future & ? secondly , customer partner actually called digital-native cohort , know microsoft known traditional old- world enterprise . kind see microsoft serving kind newer start-ups , vc-backed company , digital native going forward ? area focus ? yes . great question . healthcare perspective , think nuance acquisition opportunity 've work nuance team fantastic , right ? think -- depth sort healthcare specific knowledge , solving sort healthcare problem , coupled deep understanding ai ml voice recognition , transcription , fantastic . 've huge asset join effort , great respect opportunity able learn . think -- , healthcare perspective , lot opportunity , lot opportunity help build -- build upon solution nuance already built . also , lot partnership , lot opportunity grow expand existing partnership healthcare . especially look sort -- certainly , pandemic feel like 's coming close , say ironically , sit virtually covid . certainly , think focus pandemic diminished , think expectation healthcare . expectation virtual care , expectation able get doctor support without drive oﬃce , lot shift around sort surrounding experience , whether hospital direct patient care . think 's lot opportunity continue digital transformation . one favorite partner talked talk healthcare teladoc . teladoc , 're familiar teladoc solo , 's leading provider virtual health solution . great partner privilege get work . basically built entire communication platform entirely team sort underlying platform . great example solution , horizontal capability empower enable sort industry-specific solution would built top . combination teladoc bringing together capability like nuance , course , horizontal industry-specific solution , think healthcare great opportunity u continue expand , course , grow partnership . 's maybe longer answer expected healthcare , go . 've expressly mentioned & . 's sort announcement around & point healthcare . think much opportunity partnership point 'm really excited . second question , absolutely . think -- get little bit sort deeper discussion partner . one thing look industry specifically , certainly , feel good microsoft cloud industry-leading come horizontal technology solution . feel look sort one space 're across microsoft cloud , whether business apps infrastructure , data analytics , ai , ml certainly market-leading , 'm bullish capability . also huge amount humility fact expert every industry . expert understanding exactly 's needed across industry ability partner -- partner technology provider technology solution , whether classic technology solution existing company q - tyler radke - corey sandersthat shifting becoming technology company . mentioned , sort start-ups sort digital native offering sort net new technology solution . sort ability go partner , learn , right , matter spectrum size value able support horizontal capability , sort digital cog , expand build vertical solution end-customers . becomes great opportunity u build ( technical diﬃculty ) microsoft cloud capability , whether azure , infra . security big one , right , offering security service partner great opportunity well . ( technical diﬃculty ) sort start-ups . sort one example would schlumberger , sort massive provider service energy oil gas , 've done sort deep partnership building solution capability offer experience end-customers . 's sort wonderful partnership excited . course , 've industry long time , course , expertise . 's aifi , sort a-i-f-i , 're looking spelling , actually newer company , potential schlumberger sure retail space , sort really focusing checkout list -- checkout-free , excuse , technology . 's another one , basically able go deep partner deeply technology , solution , support whatever horizontal capability need , , whether infra data analytics , et cetera , even aspect user experience power platform . type relationship fantastic . powering 80 store new computer vision technology built , 're super excited able support part launch . , , great example true -- digital native sure , able enable business grow sort shared partnership 've got ability take retail . sorry , long answer . hope -- get talk industry . lot industry cover . talking partner know minute left . guess , maybe best way ask question -- , obviously , 're working isvs 're working big si around world , huge marketplace partner . guess , relying ? adding value term helping close deal digitize customer environment ? yes , absolutely . think two probably big example -- two biggest example 'd use , one -- well , maybe 'll use sort three example . certainly partnership horizontal level , right ? , sort q - tyler radkegreat ecosystem solution 's offering sort joint value place maybe n't offer sort different service . based customer choice , love able support full range capability . , -- recently announced expanded partnership oracle , great partnership sap , adobe . mentioned already sort azure databricks netapp file . ability bring sort partner offer , based customer choice , ability build app way want using platform using service . 's , think , cornerstone overall vision . , going back even little bit , mentioned early day working kubernetes able bring kubernetes service light . course , hindsight , everybody 's got kubernetes service , 's obvious . think focus customer choice enabling partner cornerstone platform , really fun part . also think industry really big -- would say , sort run engineering -- industry engineering team , think talk partner talk native-built service . think talk 're enabling partner industry solution simply reason mentioned . expertise . knowledge . ability focus specialized industry requirement . think sort approaching industry humility secret success , think go understanding need partner able bring value end-customers , want partner bring end value customer , excited able support way make sense . think 's sort second one . third one , along line actually pulling back previous conversation sovereignty . think sovereignty opportunity much partner-led . microsoft cloud sovereignty partner-led solution . like mentioned , sort gsis si within country , really leaning understanding local partner understand requirement government much better . , work closely partner able deliver value able deliver outcome . , think 's another area 're heavy partner-focused need partner help u achieve goal 're looking achieve . 's great . know couple minute left , figured 'd ask question data analytics business , obviously 's one company called recent quarter area strength . think azure offering ? synapse obviously power platform . context close partnership thing like databricks snowﬂake , kind key differentiation positioning customer ? - corey sander q - tyler radke yes , absolutely . power platform unique position market . integration service , 's value-add customer . , think power platform , whether service among microsoft stack partner , opportunity customer leverage low-code/no-code quite valuable regardless , right ? , includes partnership , thing like power bi working across data provider , right ? something continue work continue engage power apps offering . simple building developer experience data source come sort data capability connector support . power apps perspective , given , , developer shortage that's , 're seeing unprecedented demand company able expand leverage power apps part broader sort movement within company able add application solution various data source , , whether 're partner whether 're microsoft first party . , course , power automate , able take able sort automate experience , integrated team created bunch opportunity around frontline worker experience . abstract away sort complexity data platform , right , complexity whose data platform instead offer value automated capability top . , think power platform great sort addendum data analytics story customer may . 's sort -- n't matter analytics requirement customer underneath service 're using , power platform offer value top , 's great story customer able analyze , act automate top . think look sort overall data ai machine learning , one thing 's really great partnership , like mentioned , sort snowﬂake databricks , 's broader range sort data partner work really closely , , come back customer choice . there's wide range value offer service microsoft , whether ai-based service , ml-based service , security-based service . , partnering key partner , key data partner , enabling additional service around , think great spot able , , give customer choice able continue sort bring value platform scenario . great . well , think couple minute , appreciate time , corey . sound like 're great . hopefully , continue recover quickly , really appreciate coming supporting conference virtually . - corey sander q - tyler radke - corey sander yes , absolutely . thank much . , wish could person , yes , 'm definitely pushing lot energy right .
