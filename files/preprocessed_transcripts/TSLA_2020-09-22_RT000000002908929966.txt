's good see everyone . 's little hard read room car , 's way could . hopefully cool hopefully , hear . guy hear ? okay . right . great . well , thanks coming . think 's incredible year 'd like thank support tough time , good time , 's great . really appreciate everyone 's put hard earned money tesla . think 's worked pretty well good year think , 's many good year come . 'll go sort -- shareholder presentation fairly quickly sort real main event battery day . , really 'm going recap what's happened past year . starting yeah term ability create factory , huge kudos tesla shanghai team able go literally direct pile volume production 15 month . 's like -- think something 's really quite noteworthy , tesla foreign manufacturer 100 % owned factory china . often well understood appreciated . 100 % owned foreign factory china really big deal 's paying huge dividend . really would n't result year without great effort tesla china team . 'm super appreciative . 'll see shanghai factory continue scale quite bit right . think really could expect overtime factory produce million vehicle year . yes , 's cool . , let 's see . probably also reached past year volume production model smoothest launch 've ever . think 're definitely getting better new vehicle launch building factory scaling production . 've heard say 's -- hardest thing scaling production especially new technology , 's insanely diﬃcult ; making prototype relatively easy . think like , real achievement tesla sort car company term ? 's like n't making sort exciting prototype , tesla really first company century u.s. -- first u.s. company u.s. reach volume production sustainably profitable like -- crazy thing , really happened 100 year , 's actual super hard part . four vehicle volume production s3xy . also toughest joke , think maybe ever . diﬃcult joke make . also introduced lowest cost solar u.s. 's $ 1.49 watt . really simplified whole chain -- whole value chain . reduced sale advertising . got rid bunch unnecessary cost really relying upon fact 's lowest cost eﬃcient solar u.s. , providing retrofit solarglass roof , think really great product . hard product make work major product line future . also got four consecutive quarter gaap profitability , -- diﬃcult , yeah . 's certainly testament hard work people tesla . mean extremely diﬃcult time wide range adverse circumstance insanely hard , got done . think 've -- future looking like think promising sort annual profitability standpoint . order achieve -- order sort well financially , really need economy scale , need ideally best technology think best technology , also achieving economy scale . also rapidly improving autonomy , massive value add car . , think value tesla going like total vehicle side , total vehicle produced , time value autonomy . 's way think future value tesla . also consistent free cash ﬂow generation . really important growth key element tightening time car ordered built delivered . , company 's growing rapidly , 's extremely important tighten supply chain -- part arrive , put car quickly deliver car quickly customer , inside sort kind payable timeline . , faster grow , cash conversely , unable within payable timeline , faster grow , le money obviously bad capital-intensive situation . , tightening part moved quickly factory , put car , get customer , make massive difference cash ﬂow generation . , mean , 's 's extremely important factory continent , n't -- least factory continent . impossible achieve . , factory china , 's able serve china soon many country region key u tightening total sort chain cash ﬂow getting essentially faster grow , 'll cash . really important . 's also 's important giga berlin complete 'll factory china , factory -- factory u.s. , soon , second factory u.s. austin factory europe . mean , even -- giga , texas austin , even exactly class california , would still advantageous roughly two-thirds way across u.s. , -- term delivering car central u.s. east coast far -- 's faster , cost le fundamentally improves economics . , think also maybe something 's fully appreciated . important factory least continent reasonably close end customer , tighten whole chain . industry performance -- rest industry gone , tesla gone . think speaks -- thanks . , 'd like thank customer taking chance tesla buying product really hope 're enjoying . really -- sale saying really grow word mouth . , really think pure -- 's pure sense 's like 's growing basis existing owner recommending -- new customer . really think good way grow . 2019 , 50 % growth think , 'll really pretty well 2020 , probably somewhere 30 % 40 % growth despite lot diﬃcult circumstance . mean , 's many pandemic wildfire , like whole bunch diﬃcult production issue , thanks hard work tesla team lot innovative approach overcoming issue . able still see good growth one diﬃcult -- fact , 'd say probably diﬃcult year tesla 's existence . , also published extended impact report . tesla , try hard right thing . think happen 's may made mistake 're aware , always try right thing best ability publish extended impact report show sort self-examination okay right ? wrong ? better future ? 're definitely trying accomplish good . , occasionally make mistake , work quickly fix right thing . , 's worth looking like average like stuff -- average life cycle emission u.s. much better tesla -- electric car -- kind gasoline car ? 'll talk battery day also much grid around world actually especially u.s. greening . actually much faster think people realize . u.s. moving towards sustainable energy . , move sustainable energy , effectively end building solar factory car factory solar . time sustainable energy , time even mine sustainable energy eventually get effective emission zero . 's thing end . , also safety core design . tesla car safest car ever designed . lowest probability injury car ever tested u.s. government 's passive safety add active safety . 's even better . , 's really -- safety important , obviously , safest car could drive tesla . , think people sometimes -- people n't aware 's really -- safety paramount . actually number one design objective built tesla safety . factory also becoming safer . look sort accident per vehicle -- total vehicle made , dramatically better past 's already better industry average 're confident get best auto industry . autopilot functionality continues improve see safety report publish every quarter . 's getting better better . u.s. average collision roughly 2.1 per million mile autopilot engaged , 's 0.3. mean , profound difference . really massive get even better . , we're confident time , get probability accident , especially probability injury 10 time better industry average like order magnitude better . , 's lot life saved lot injury avoided . 's huge priority u . yes autopilot front , think 's kind hard people judge progress autopilot like 'm driving -- matter course , 've always done . drive bleeding edge alpha build autopilot . sort insight going previously couple year ago , 're kind stuck local maximum . , 're improving like improvement kind started tailing getting need . 're quite close getting trapped local maximum fundamental rewrite entire autopilot software stack labeling software well . , 're labeling 3d video , hugely different previously labeling essentially bunch single image eight camera would labeled different time different people label literally ca n't tell 're labeling . , basically made sort case impossible label label lot error . new labeling tool , label video . actually label entire video segment system -- get basically surround video thing label surround video time -- 's taking camera simultaneously looking image change time labeling . , sophistication neural net car overall logic car improved dramatically . think , hopefully release private beta autopilot full self-driving version autopilot think month . people really understand magnitude change , profound . , yes , anyway , 's 'll see 's like hell step change , rewrite everything labeling software , entire code base.it took u quite . sort new sort call like 4d sense 's three dimension plus time . 's taken u rewrite everything , 'll see 's like . going -- 's amazing . yeah . 's clearly going work . tesla , core competency , 've got engineering , obviously , also manufacturing . think manufacturing underappreciated general , diﬃculty designing machine make machine vastly harder machine . designing , like making model 3 model cybertruck prototype really quite trivial compared designing factory make , especially 's new technology , want use new manufacturing method . 's least 10 100 time harder factory prototype . 's see lot company startup 'll bring prototype , ca n't get hump manufacturing , manufacturing new technology especially hardest thing far . basically , prototype best 10 % diﬃculty probably closer 1 % . software . tesla hardware software company , huge percentage engineer actually software engineer , think car kind like laptop wheel software incredibly important . alan prescott andrew d. baglino elon muskactually , car , also factory . factory software extremely important . software general . mean , fundamental . three critical area needed make awesome company . , yeah . -- , 'll soon three new factory incremental -- well , one already three different continent . shanghai , 're expanding shanghai second phase . berlin making rapid progress , texas making even faster progress . , yeah . factory , 're trying also improve manufacturing technology , case like model made berlin might look , actually made much eﬃcient way . yeah , we'll talk later battery presentation . yeah , launched megapack . 's three megawatt hour all-in one energy storage solution , 's great overall . yeah . right . think 's basically , right ? right , thank . right . well , thanks , everyone , coming , 'll back little bit go battery stuff , 's little bit . addition battery stuff , 've got extra well . think 'll really like say battery . battery stuff 're going talk truly revolutionary essential tesla 's goal . fundamental good tesla , 's like , look back history say , good tesla ? good many year accelerate sustainable energy ? 's true metric success . matter sustainable energy happens faster slower , 's really think tesla ass progress . many year accelerate sustainable energy ? 're going talk battery thing really explain 're going make step change improvement acceleration sustainable energy . thank . hi , folk . great . going take short break . begin battery day event , stay tuned . 're local audience today , feel free get car stretch leg , try stay near car going begin properly little bit . see soon . hello , everyone . sure , thanks , elon . hi , 'm drew baglino , svp powertrain energy engineering tesla 'm incredibly excited talk 've battery tesla . great . great . let 's see . 've got clicker ? andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk yes , got clicker , yes . yes , 'll take first , perhaps . sure obviously , issue facing serious . climate change 're experiencing issue day-to-day basis . 's incredibly important accelerate advent sustainable energy . time really matter . presentation accelerating time sustainable energy . , past five year hottest record . look like wall co2 ppm . 's obviously , time like past . 's really important take action . running climate experiment insane . -- especially , 's transitory one anyway . yes . 're going run fossil fuel . let 's move future run experiment longer . yes . talk ladder . got . andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglinookay . lot good news though . lot people may aware wind solar comprise 75 % new electricity capacity u.s. year . really major . grid going sustainable quickly . , 's also worth noting length time power plant last order 25 year . even hundred percent energy generation sustainable , still take 25 year convert grid . 's also worth noting past 10 year , power production coal dropped half . went 46 % electricity 2010 23 % 2020. massive improvement . good thing happening lot level . need go faster . tesla 's contribution , 've delivered million electric vehicle , 26 billion electric mile driven , many gigawatt hour stationary battery , 17 terawatt hour solar generated . think solar sometimes underweighted tesla , massive part future . three part sustainable energy future sustainable energy generation , storage , electric vehicle . intend play significant role three . accelerate transition sustainable energy , must produce ev need affordable lot energy storage , building factory faster far le investment . goal number one terawatt hour scale battery production . tera new giga . terawatt thousand time gigawatt . used talk term gigawatts , future , 'll talking term terawatt hour . 's needed order transition world sustainability . yes , see 's -- 're talking 100x growth battery electric vehicle achieve mission going get . matter fast intention accelerate . yes , basically order roughly 10 terawatt-hours year battery production transition global ﬂeet vehicle electric . average vehicle last 15 year . , 're talking 150 terawatt hour give take transition whole electric -- vehicle type electric . yes , 's lot battery basically . yes , -- elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskand grid side , similar mountain climb . 1,600 time growth today 's grid battery go 100 % renewable grid take existing heating fossil fuel us home business , 100 % electric . yes , number think , might grow even dependent -- world economy matures country high population industrialize , could see number even . let 's say 's like roughly 20 25 terawatt hour per year , sustained 15 25 year transition world renewable . lot . yes . today 's battery ca n't scale fast enough , 're small . giga nevada , 150 gigawatt hour per year like probably expect make . really pretty small grand scheme thing , 's 0.15 terawatt hour . cost much , -- would need 135 fully built nevada giga factory achieve 20 terawatt- hour year . 's scalable enough solution , need dramatic rethink cell manufacturing system scale fast . yes think view question money . money sort like ethereal thing , 's really amount effort . certain amount effort term people machine depending eﬃcient effort , given amount effort want amount battery . 's question like , well , $ 2 trillion , -- tomorrow could make , 's easy , actually need organize massive number people , build lot machine , build machine make machine 's incredibly important effort , yield number battery . go obviously need make affordable car . think one thing trouble n't yet truly affordable car something make future . order , 've got get cost battery . 've got make -- 've got better manufacturing need something curve , curve -- curve cost per kilowatt hour battery improving fast enough . given lot thought many year say -- radically improve cost per kilowatt hour curve . 's somewhat ﬂattening actually recent year . -- andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino mean , early growth promising kind plateauing . that's 's motivating u rethink cell produced designed . yes , exactly . ev market share growing ev still n't accessible . 's -- see -- drew saying 's like starting ﬂatten little bit , rate improvement affordability car fast enough . 's , got battery day . make best car world , designed vehicle factory ground . next battery well . yes . 's slide n't show quite right -- look like show ( inaudible ) let 's get started . plan cost per kilowatt hour . 's plan rest single innovation , research project never see light day , 's plan taken creative engineering industrialization across every facet make cell battery pack raw material finish thing . 're going go plan today step step build get goal accelerate transition make vehicle grid battery affordable . 're basically -- thought every element battery -- almost every element , element wo n't get today , get future . yes . first get far , let 's talk battery cell ? 've got cap , negative positive terminal cell , open cell , 've got tab connected terminal . call jelly roll , wound electrode inside . actually see look like unwind , meter long typical 2170 cell , 's quite long winding process see tab still . elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskand explain 's actually going , 've identified 've got anode , cathode separator , positive negative terminal , happens -- go . discharge cell , got lithium moving anode cathode reverse charge cell , anode moving -- lithium moving cathode anode across separator . basic make lithium-ion battery , whether -- matter form factor . look 's happened today , least product , 've moved 18650 form factor 2170 form factor great collaboration partner panasonic , new partner like lg catl probably others future . actually , slight note one called 18650 , although slide , 2170 , first two digit refer diameter second two digit refer length . help explain -- 's weird number , like nobody could explain extra zero . said , okay , well , 're deleting zero , nobody explain future form factor . 's 's technically 's like 18650 bizarrely going forward 2170 , got rid extra zero 's pointless . evolutionary step going 1865 2170 , bringing 50 % energy cell . look ideal cell design , need go beyond 're looking u front u study full spectrum option . see , kind swept key figure merit . much reduce cost much vehicle range increase , change outer diameter cell . found sweet spot somewhere around 46 meter -- 's millimeter . 's bigger form factor , like anybody could make bigger form factor . fool , could make bigger form factor , fool . yes exactly . problem make cell larger , fact supercharging thermal general become really challenging make bigger cell challenge team set sight overcome . . came table architecture maybe 've heard . basically remove thermal problem equation , allows u go absolute lowest cost form factor simplest manufacturing process . mean talk table . 's kind beautiful thing . andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglinothat 's t-shirt mean , 's esoteric nobody could figure , -- yes , basically took existing foil , laser pattered enabled dozen connection active material shingled spiral see simpler manufacturing , fewer part , 50 millimeter versus 250 millimeter electrical path length , get thermal benefit . yes , important appreciate , like basically distance electron travel 's much le . actually shorter path length large table cell smaller cell tab , big deal . even though cell bigger , actually power , power weight ratio actually better smallest cell tab . -- like quite hard , 's -- nobody 's done . -- really took tremendous amount effort within tesla engineering figure make freaking table cell actually work connect top cap 's -- 's whole bunch thing 're keeping little secret sauce 're telling everything , -- sometimes , 's elegant simple still hard -- took u lot trial , 're happy ended . yes , mean everything 's simple recollection , see -- everything -- 's hard 's discovered 's simple . anyways , 's lot really cool thing going enable table 's really -- due really great engineering team , drew rest team done amazing work achieving table construction . sound -- think may sort sound bit silly people , like -- people really know cell , massive breakthrough . cylindricals able get rid tab , dramatically simplifies winding coding . yes . elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglinoand awesome thermal performance benefit . yes . -- elaborate bit , 's like cell going system , keep stopping tab . yes . ca n't continuous motion production tab , keep stopping 's rate start stop accelerate , really slows rate production sometimes get tab wrong also get -- lose little bit active area . 's really huge pain- in-the-ass type tab production standpoint . yes . put together go new 80 millimeter length , 4680 call new cell design . get 5x energy 6x power enable 16 % range increase form factor alone . yes , 's pretty great . clarify see plus 16 % whatever percentage range increase , amount due particular innovation . yes . 'll list whole bunch innovation . add , get total improvement energy density cost , number refer thing . yes . want stress . concept rendering . starting ramp-up manufacturing cell pilot 10 gigawatt/hour production facility around corner . elon musk andrew d. baglino yes . 's video 's going plant . , mean , 's clear , take year reach 10 gigawatt/hour capacity . important appreciate , like build factory , 's certain capacity design take period time actually achieve capacity . would say 's probably year get 10 gigawatt/hour annualized rate pilot plant , pilot plant . actual production plant order maybe 200 gigawatt/hours maybe overtime . -- thank . let 's stack everything saw cell level . cell form factor change enables 14 % -- dollar per kilowatt hour reduction , cell form factor change . 've teased factory , we're going go walk step step factory discus series innovation . thinking ideal cell factory , inspiration behind u paper bottling industry , humble beginning , century innovation enabled mass scale continuous motion , unbelievably low manufacturing cost . think lithium-ion industry really third decade high-volume production , far go achieve similar scale simplicity , inspiration set team thought marry cell design manufacturing best possible factory . let 's talk little bit 's cell factory . first , 's electrode process active material coded film foil . foil -- coated foil wound winding process . talked tab , start stop lot . jelly roll assembled , sealed , filled electrolyte , sent formation cell charged first time sort electrochemistry set quality cell verified . set , every step process , try take inspiration showed think make process fundamentally better scalable . one important process begin , wet process electrode coating . give sense scale , 'm going walk 's wet process . 've got mixing powder mixed either water solvent , solvent cathode . mix go large coat dry oven , slurry coated onto foil . huge oven , ten meter long , dried , solvent recovered . see solvent recovery system . finally , coded foil compressed final density . 're looking , 're like wow , 's lot equipment one step , especially consider little speck next coating oven elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglinoperson . serious iron involved making battery . would n't great could skip solvent step , one dig ditch fill kind thing put solvent take recycle , go straight dry mix coat . 's dry process really . basic form , see bench top , literally powder film simple . mean 's hard actually . clear . easy , everyone would . -- 's like dry coating electrode actually easy , 's actually hard appears simple thing , 's worth noting . -- acquire maxwell like little year ago guess . certainly good company everything , dry coating like -- like sort 'd call proof-of-concept . since acquisition , 've actually ramped machine dry coating 4x . revision full post acquisition machine 's still lot work . would say like completely bag . still lot work . scale -- go like benchtop lab pilot volume production , actually major issue encounter every level . 's like make something work bench bingo , make bazillion . absolutely . 's insanely diﬃcult scale . yes . -- yes . scale , saw becomes . yes . elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglinoso see motivation . 10x reduction footprint , 10x reduction energy massive reduction investment , elon saying , simple hard . yes . mean clear , would like say right , 's totally working . 's close working , 's -- even , pilot plant level , close working . well , okay , think 's fair say probably work , good - - high-yield . yes , -- 're still ironing kink , 've made ten thousand cell , thousand kilometer electrode . mean fourth generation equipment , 've learned lot along along way . yes . mean super demanding , every atom place want deliver energy density cycle life supercharging . yes . 're confident get , lot work along way . 's clear path success , ton work . yes . -- really profound improvement people know battery manufacturing . -- 's gigantic . 'll probably machine revision six seven time large scale production . rate machine improved extremely rapid , like literally every three four month new row . yes . beyond electrode , continue innovate every process step . let 's talk little assembly next . key high-performing assembly line accomplishing process motion -- continuous motion elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskthinking line highway max velocity highway , start stop , city driving . definitely . stop light traﬃc light , everything . want highway . highway . yes . together internal design team make equipment design equipment , coupled thinking make best cell , 're thinking make best equipment could accomplish fastest part per minute rate tool . development , able get point implement assembly line , one line 20 gigawatt hour , 7x increase output per line . 're thinking scalability pure effort one line 7x capability effort multiplying . yes . sort think like sort fundamental physic factory something like -- think 's actually quite lot like rocket equation 've got basically -- equation 've got exhaust velocity log start mass . 's basically saying -- fast thing going percentage -- factory volume useful work conveyance count useful work . -- value added step . yes . could break factory cubic meter section say -- smaller , could like one litter section say , majority volume useful work ? would astounded bad factory . like maybe 2 % 3 % including factory fremont . think possible get least 10x volumetric eﬃciency . well like 30 % -ish maybe 10x better , mean factory 10x smaller . thing fast thing going factory , 's like speed density . andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskthe faster go -- factory 's moving , let 's say twice speed another factory equivalent two factory basically . company successful company one factory accomplish company take two three four factory . 're trying , say , okay , one factory achieve maybe 5 even 10 factory would normally required achieve . vertical integration machine design team grohmann hibar others allows u really accomplish , n't edge condition one piece equipment another , design entire machine one machine remove unnecessary step . yes . mean basically tesla aiming best manufacturing company earth . thing 's actually important long run . think company standpoint basically achieving sustainability fast possible , think also long-term competitiveness , eventually every car company long-range electric car , eventually every company autonomy , think -- every company great manufacturing . tesla absolutely head shoulder anyone else manufacturing , goal . manufacturing hard hard problem fun . yes . okay , let 's talk formation . typical cell factory , formation represents 25 % investment formation . 's charging discharging cell verifying quality cell . turn 've charged discharged billion billion cell vehicle , know thing two . typical formation setup charge discharge cell individually car , charge thousand cell . took principal power electronics leveraging powerwall vehicle battery management system others dramatically improve formation equipment cost effectiveness density . 86 % reduction formation investment , 75 % reduction footprint . want take one ? andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musksure . essentially translates based know today 75 % reduction investment per kilowatt hour gigawatt/hour . 's basically 4x better current state-of-the-art best knowledge . think 's probably room improve even beyond . definitely . definitely , yes . 're able , volume standpoint , actually get smaller form factor giga nevada , able get many time cell output . see like basically get terawatt hour le space took make gigawatt hour , 150 gigawatt hour . pretty profound , 's like - - would actually thought possible several year ago could actually get terawatt hour scale le space currently envisioned 150 gigawatt hour . yes , simpler accelerates terawatt hour scale 's need accelerate mission . elon said , 're going try even improve push towards goal -- yes . -- talking tesla internal cell production . tweeted earlier , continue use cell supplier , panasonic lg catl . 100 gigawatt hour supplemental buy supplier . yes , essentially like reduce weighted average cost cell , -- allows u make lot car lot stationary storage . long-term , 're expecting make order 3,000 gigawatt hour 3 terawatt hour per year . think -- think 've got good chance achieving actually 2030 , 'm highly confident could 2030. look size factory previous page , really show enabling advancement achieving 3 terawatt hour goal 2030. manufacturing innovation , fantastic enabling scale , also additional 18 % reduction dollar per kilowatt hour battery pack level . wait , 's . andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino wait , 's . yes . manufacturing system . 've got cell design . active material 're going put cell design . let 's talk anode first . let's talk silicon . silicon awesome ? 's awesome 's abundant element earth 's crust oxygen , mean 's everywhere , sand . yes , sand silicon dioxide . yes . happens store 9x lithium graphite , typical anode material lithium-ion battery today . n't everybody using ? main reason challenge silicon expands 4x fully charged lithium , basically expansion stress particle , particle start cracking , start electrically isolating , lose capacity , energy retention battery start fade also gum passivation layer keep reforming particle expand . yes , basically silicon , cookie crumbles get gooey , 's basically happens . good analogy . yes . current approach solve exist . mean silicon car 're right , involved highly engineered expensive material elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskscheme thing . , 're still great enable benefit silicon , n't enable , 're scalable enough . see thing maybe 've heard sio , silicon carbon silicon nanowires , 's kind space right . 're proposing step change capability step change cost , really , go raw metallurgical silicon . n't engineer base metal , start design expand , think particle electrode de ign code ? yes . 'm sure saw -- basically dollar -- basically use simple silicon , 's dramatically le even silicon currently used battery made today use lot . anode would cost -- yes , silicon anode cost $ 1.20 kilowatt hour . work ? start raw metallurgical silicon , stabilize surface elastic ion conducting polymer coating applied scalable approach . like chemical vapor deposition , highly engineered , high capex solution integrated electrode robust network formed highly elastic binder . end , leveraging , silicon potential , increase range vehicle additional 20 % improvement . yes , get cheaper longer range . yes . take anode cost reduction , 're looking another 5 % dollar per kilowatt-hour reduction battery pack level 's . let 's talk cathode . battery cathode ? cathode like bookshelf metal , nickel , cobalt , manganese aluminum like shelf lithium book . really set apart different metal many book lithium fit shelf sturdy shelf . cobalt -- yes , sorry . would say like , 's exactly figure right analogy explain cathode anode , bookshelf probably pretty good one sense need stable structure contain ion . want structure crumble get gooey basically hold shape cathode anode . 're moving ion back forth , need retain structure . n't retain structure , lose cycle life battery capacity drop quickly . andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk absolutely , yes , totally agree . think people always talking like , oh , 's cathode going , nc whatever , thing consider fundamentally nickel -- metal capable 's chart , $ 1 per kilowatt-hour cathode metal , using lme , london metal exchange price versus energy density cathode . see , nickel cheapest highest energy density 's increasing nickel goal really everybody 's energy -- battery industry . one reason cobalt even used , stable bookshelf , challenge going pure nickel stabilizing bookshelf nickel , 's 've working high nickel cathode development , zero cobalt , leveraging novel coating , -- novel coating open [ ph ] . get 15 % reduction cathode $ 1 per kilowatt hour . yes , . 's nickel . want ? yes , sure . order scale , really need make sure 're constrained total nickel availability . actually spoke ceo biggest mining company world said , please make nickel , important . think going make nickel , 's also think need kind three-tiered approach battery . starting iron , 's kind like medium range nickel manganese sort medium plus intermediate high nickel long-range application , like cyber truck semi . yes , something like semi truck , 's extremely important high energy density order get long-range . -- give sort iron bit time like -- -- look watt hour per kilogram cathode level iron , look like nickel 's twice good . fully considered pack level , everything else taken account , nickel maybe 50 % 60 % better iron . iron little better would seem , -- look pack level fully considered . 's good nickel , nickel like 50 % 60 % better , 's still -- 's actually pretty good . , good stationary storage medium-range application energy density paramount , like said intermediate , 's kind nickel manganese 's relatively straightforward cathode 's two- third nickel , one-third manganese would allow u make 50 % cell volume amount nickel . andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino little energy trade-off . yes . enough still want use 100 % nickel something like semi truck , really much sacrifice -- yes . beyond metal , lot people spent time talking metal , actually cathode process big target , 35 % cathode dollar per kilowatt-hour -- transferring final form . see big target decided take . 's view traditional cathode process . effectively start start left metal mine , first thing happens metal mind changed intermediate thing called metal sulfate , 's happened chemist wanted long time ago . 're making cathode , take intermediate thing called metal sulfate add chemical , add whole bunch water , whole bunch stuff happens middle , end , get little bit cathode whole bunch wastewater byproduct . yes , 's -- insanely complicated . look total -- like , 're like , 's small journey nickel , happens 's like -- crazy . like 're going around world three time , 's like moral equivalent like digging ditch , fill ditch , dig ditch . 's total madness basically . thing grew 're kind like legacy thing -- 's like done connected dot , really n't think whole thing like first principle standpoint saying get nickel ore ground finished nickel product battery . 've looked entire value chain said , make simple possible . 's 're proposing process . see , whole le -- whole lot le going . get rid intermediate , metal water , final elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskproduct cathode , recirculate water , waste water . summer -- summarize , 's 66 % reduction capex investment , 76 % reduction process cost zero waste water ; much scalable solution . think fact 're actually directly consuming raw metal nickel powder , dramatically simplifies metal refining part whole process . eliminate billion battery grade nickel intermediate production , 's needed . also use process previous page directly consume metal powder coming recycled electric vehicle good storage battery . process enables simpler mining simple recycling . process , obviously 're going go start building cathode facility north america leveraging north american resource exist nickel lithium , localizing cathode supply chain production , reduce mile traveled material end cathode 80 % , huge cost . yes , clear cathode production would part -- tesla cell production plant . -- basically raw material coming mine raw material mine , come battery . note , way lithium end cell cathode . obviously site lithium conversion well , using new process 're going pioneer , 's sulfate free process , skip intermediate , 33 % reduction lithium cost , 100 % electric facility co- located cathode plant . yes . 's important note massive amount lithium earth . lithium like oil , 's massive amount pretty much everywhere . fact 's enough lithium united state convert entire united state ﬂeet electric . 's like car united state , -- like 300 million something like , every vehicle united state converted electric using lithium available united state . discovered today . yes , already know good . andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino people really n't even looking . yes , people trying , like widely available . -- important say like okay , smartest way take ore extract lithium environmentally friendly way ? actually discovered -- looking sort first principle physic standpoint , instead way 's always done , -- 've found , actually use table salt , sodium chloride basically extract lithium ore. -- nobody done best knowledge ; nobody 's done 's -- sort element reusable , 's sustainable way obtaining lithium . actually got right lithium clay deposit nevada . 10,000 acre . 10,000 acre . nature mining actually think also environmentally sensitive , sort take chunk dirt ground remove lithium put chunk dirt back . look pretty much , look like terrible , yes , 'll nice . simply mix clay salt , put water ; salt come lithium , done . yes , 's pretty crazy . yes , 're really excited really enough lithium nevada alone electrify entire u.s. ﬂeet . yes , guess 's true . actually 's nevada , 's basically much damn lithium earth , 's crazy . one common element planet . elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskand eventually , said beginning , get steady state 20 terawatt hour per year production , transfer entire non-renewable ﬂeet power plant , home heating battery -- industry heating vehicle electric . point , awesome resource battery recycle make new battery . n't need mining point see . difference value material coming back vehicle versus ground , 'd always go vehicle . recycle 100 % vehicle battery today , actually starting pilot full scale recycling production gigafactory reno next quarter continue develop process recycling return . yes , mean date , 's done third-parties , think recycle battery effectively , especially since -- battery , making battery thing 're recycling . whereas like third party recyclers consider battery kind ? yes . think actually mean , recycling resource always 10 greater year delayed , battery last really long time . eventually way resource made available , 's 're investing recycling facility nevada . yes . long-term , new battery come old battery , ﬂeet reach steady state , right ? okay . talked scaling cathode recycling . benefit saw added benefit 12 % reduction dollar per kilowatt hour battery pack level , almost half cost goal , 's one section . take away , elon . mean 's architecture 've wanting tesla long time 're finally -- finally figured . think 's way electric car future ultimately made . 's right way thing . start single piece casting single piece casting front body rear body . order , commissioned largest casting machine ever made , 's currently working road fremont plant . -- 's pretty sweet , making entire -- currently making entire rear section car , single piece high pressure die cast aluminum . order , actually develop alloy , wanted high-strength casting alloy require coating heat treatment . big deal casting . especially large casting , heat treated afterwards , tends deform . kind like like potato chip thing ? 's hard keep large casting shape . order achieve , alloy existed could . developed alloy , special alloy aluminum high strength without heat treat castable . 's -- 's great achievement material team . fact general , 've got lot advanced material coming tesla new alloy material never existed . basically making front rear car single piece -- -- interface call structural battery battery first time dual use -- battery -- use energy device structure . absolutely way thing done . early day aircraft , would carry fuel tank cargo . fuel tank actually -- quite diﬃcult carry . like basically worse cargo . kind bolt . diﬃcult . somebody said , hey , make wing tank ? make fuel tank wing shape ? airplane , fuel tank -- wing fuel tank wing shape . absolutely way . fuel tank serf dual structure 's -- 's longer cargo , 's fundamental structure aircraft . major breakthrough . 're car . really quite profound . -- effectively non-cell portion battery negative mass . save much mass rest vehicle . save mass rest vehicle non-cell portion battery . 's like , well , really minimize mass battery ? make negative , make battery -- non-cell portion battery pack negative ? also allows u pack cell densely , intermediate structure battery pack . instead like support stabilizer stringer structural element battery , lot space battery pack structural . -- 'd essentially , like -- like instead filler ﬂame retardant , currently 3 battery pack , filler structural adhesive well ﬂame retardant . effectively glue cell top bottom sheet . allows shear transfer upper lower sheet . like like formula 1 craft like racing boat carbon fiber face sheet say aluminum honeycomb , give incredible stiffness . 's really way super fast thing work create -- basically honeycomb sandwich two pace sheet . andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglinothis actually even better aircraft , aircraft . ca n't fuel liquid . case , battery solid . actually use steel shell case battery transfer shear upper lower face sheet , make incredibly stiff structure even stiffer regular car . fact -- like convertible upper structure , would stiffer , convertible would stiffer regular car . -- really -- 's really major . improves mass eﬃciency battery casting also quite important , want transfer load structural battery pack smooth continuous way , n't put arbitrary point load battery . kind -- want sort feather load front rear structural battery . also allows u use -- move cell closer center car , n't -- top one , got sort support stuff . volumetric eﬃciency structural pack much better non-structural pack actually bring cell closer center , 're closer center reduces probability side impact potentially contacting cell , go   kind side impact , go order reach cell . also prof 's called polar moment inertia , -- take like 's like ice skater arm arm , arm , rotate faster . bring thing closer thing closer center , reduce polar moment inertia , mean -- car maneuver better , feel better . -- n't know , feel agile . 's really cool . really major , 'd say , sort 10 % mass production body car , 14 % range increase , 370 fewer part . mean , really think long-term , car take architecture , competitive . 's product level better product , factory , 's massive simplification . saw part removal , 's casting machine , 's structural battery pack . looking 50 % reduction investment per gigawatt hour , 35 % reduction ﬂoor space 'll continue improve make vehicle factory future . yes , major improvement front cell way vehicle . addition improvement said enabling additional range improving structural performance vehicle , worth another 7 % dollar per elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon musk andrew d. baglino elon muskkilowatt-hour reduction battery pack level bringing total reduction 56 % dollar per kilowatt hour . yes . right . stacking , 're talking cost range , 've got look facet . range increase , 're unlocking 54 % increase range vehicle energy density energy product ; 56 % reduction dollar per kilowatt hour battery pack level 69 % reduction investment per gigawatt hour , true enabler talk back achieve scale . yes . yes -- think 's pretty nice investment per kilowatt -- per gigawatt hour reduction 69 % , mean would thought ? yes , happened happen way . mean 0.420 % course . yes . enables u achieve new trajectory reduction cell cost . clear , take u probably year 18 month start realizing advantage probably -- fully realize advantage , probably 's three year thereabouts .
