good morning , everyone . 'm vivek arya bank america merrill lynch semiconductor team . 'm absolutely delighted welcome everyone technology conference . especially delighted colette kress , cfo nvidia , kick semiconductor part session . also joined arnab chanda shawn simmons investor relation team . thought would start discussion q & . open question . welcome , colette . thank joining u . thank . much . maybe start , thought could go different segment . week , computex show , already announced pascal gtx product . think formal unveiling product week . news competitor , amd , also . could take step back give u sense pc gaming market , done last four , five year , pascal mean . shape next year might look like business . colette kress vivek arya colette kress sure . representation gaming market , big part nvidia . gaming business represents 50 % -- 60 % overall revenue size . last couple year , tremendous success existing architecture , maxwell , term driving overall market high-end gaming . seen growth rate probably 35 % last couple year term cagr . finished q1 fiscal year 2017 continuation growth . business grew 17 % . mentioned , also announced right end q1 newest architecture pascal . pascal , announced two new card , two high-end card , 1080 1070 , begun selling received astounding review , reviewer well gamers extremely enthusiastic . lot significant improvement term performance even highest- end card last generation well price point thing prior architecture . excited unveil . work term computex continue talk . talk underlying hardware . work 've around ecosystem . ecosystem around gaming overall design work , vr work term sdks . software platform help make gaming continue even better . yesterday ebay , saw card selling like $ 1,200 , $ 1,800 , right ? two three time -- n't remember last time semiconductor product selling two three time list price . question enough supply customer need right ? supply hurdle supply limitation ? . really excited people enthused term founder ' addition . coming first 1080s 1070s . expected , extremely , extremely popular . 'll supply quite shortly aic card market quite shortly . short period time founder card , seeing lot unique price point . , 'll ready aics shortly . vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kress got . lastly , saw amd also announced competing architecture polaris . started pricing card low $ 199 . seen competitive landscape , anything surprised ? sort expected going set pricing product ? yes . n't surprise term seen . really started path overall pascal , trying create arena card essentially every part pc market . enabling high-end gaming . also making sure enabling vr every stage . performance card far extremely well received , particularly price point . 'll continue see pascal come power-eﬃcient card probably enable performance almost every single level pascal continues . got . upgrade opportunity , think lot time , try simplify discussion growth term unit content . remember analyst day said last five year 20 % compounded growth rate pc gaming . sort 9 % unit , 11 % content . look next three , four year , see two trend shaped individually ? unit side , understand 's probably upgrade opportunity . stronger pascal ? asp side , thing 're card , right ? course , pricing new product better . could talk unit asp trend , think would helpful . sure . referring discussed investor day back early part spring , result 've seen 's lot discussion 35 % growth , largest driver business ? overall tam improvement tam growth 've seen period time continuing benefit u . believe 've big part expanding overall tam term bringing gamers market . gamers come market based game available , better production value game . better accessibility broadband around world brought board . also 've seen expansion esports . vivek arya colette kressthe expansion esports literally put gaming arena form entertainment : social platform people online together . expanding overall user big part overall growth we've seen unit continue increase market , aside people looking overall pc exactly grown . also , 've seen increase term asp . necessarily u pricing different level . gamers coming experiencing gaming much higher production term card buy . 've seen continued move buying higher higher end card game become available . pascal architecture another opportunity realize higher end gaming , look opportunity upgrade . think installed base , 's probably 100 million gamers . see 80 million , one geforce experience , downloading thing need game term driver configuration . 80 million , still small percentage currently current architecture , maxwell . moving pascal definitely opportunity upgrade . 'll see think term higher higher- end card . expect probably continue going forward well . fair think somebody buying , let 's say , $ 99 card content part $ 99 card -- n't know whether 's $ 20 $ 25 , something range . gamer buying $ 299 $ 399 card , content part card much greater percentagewise used . reference regarding add-in card market . add-in card , consider jewel inside add-in card representing chip memory key thing supply , revenue u . working add-in card market , supply rest different component may incorporated card . still majority content matter price point inside card probably continuation . 've seen addition coming founder , also unique component really bring higher level . high-end component addition regular aic market term founders' addition . , goal really provide right card right type gamer . expect u earn 've historically . vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kress role vr play ? already seeing direct indirect benefit ? still come , think ? think early phase vr . believe think vr next generation high-end gaming absolutely 'll see going forward . goal enable vr across wide spectrum individual . individual term mainstream vr player , high-end enthusiast type gamers , well also vr move professional . nowhere stage 'd say vr already good enough mean . 's significant amount work done improve . focus providing card level . also working software component engineer vr experience continue better . think , early stage . 's bonus top see term high-end gaming look vr . ask quantify everything nth detail . look trend , whether 's rise number gamers , increased attention esports . whether look content game opportunity competitive position , fair think still midteens kind growth opportunity nvidia next two , three year ? think perception strong cycle , sort peak rate cycle . console getting later part side growth , also slow pc gaming . see anything slows pc gaming next two three year ? pc gaming extremely healthy entertainment market . differs quite bit existing console type business . console relatively long cycle , necessarily one change go . 's buy console stay many , many , many year . 's level current production value game right lot high-end gamers . see continue expand term people coming online game , really feed type game game developer building overall market . see , 's continuation 've seen , great position . vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kressour pascal architecture even allows come board experience great part pc gaming friend esports type thing . n't see changing . think 's healthy position . think 're good space right new pascal architecture . got . last question gaming one trend remember investor day discussion emerging market still big part penetration obviously developed market . anything special emerging market expand penetration level ? 's good question . people tend look u european country understand key trend . asia pac area , unique see expansion pc gaming . correct 's many part world broadband access term western world . 've come much faster pace really surrounded pc -- excuse , pc versus u division sometimes type form factor . focus enabling different level asia pac area . may seed initial thing taken place western world many year ago . different market see asia pac continue fuel exactly 've done already existing market . got . one last question competition , come frequently investor perception new amd : thing different , better architecture , also adopted new 14 nanometer , 16 nanometer finfet technology . see marketplace , difference whether term pricing different competitively ? dominant share market , right ? making case 's easier u take share nvidia right point right much better point . seen anything different competitive landscape ? say different last several year , think 's nvidia . think way 've chosen approach strategic aspect selling gaming market really transformed platform type approach . vivek arya colette kressit 's chip . 's bigger better chip . resource , engineering horsepower absolutely build best technology 's . 've surrounded working across entire ecosystem , software developer overall gamers , giving ability involved community gamers continuing expand . get nvidia term sale platform , community . overall understanding gaming whole . n't get chip . n't seen term strategy anywhere else nvidia . 'd say change primarily nvidia would say anywhere else . high-end gamers pretty much stay nvidia based commitment continue test boundary performance eﬃciency card provide . think 's see . got . moving onto data center business , one star recent earnings call . could maybe take step back help u understand segment business ? whether 's hyperscale versus high-performance computing versus enterprise . key application address ? sort quick intro business . sure . data center business little bit different seeing gaming side . gaming take place really trying enable high-end graphic need . 're talking data center , 've used using gpu accelerate computing key component computing platform move forward . 've part data center business eight year . eight year term high-performance computing using gpu accelerate many application high-performance computing several large supercomputer across world . one part one segment data center business . second piece also focus last two gtcs . discussed term continued rise deep learning deep learning framework artificial intelligence . new era using deep neuronets actually help artificial intelligence framework using deep learning build artificial intelligence many key application , primarily right lot hyperscales breadth depth hyperscales using deep learning many different type application . number three , also place cloud computing . position gpu cloud leveraged streaming vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kressenvironment partitioned thing one many using overall gpu . three business underneath data center growing quite nicely . continue scale , understanding use gpu . performance , programmability , power eﬃciency make probably form factor people using deep learning deep learning training . 're going continue focus expanding enterprise , industry . real industry data essential . understanding data serve end customer key focus . 's driver underlying data center business . expect continue . , revenue reported business think surprised everyone . impact one two large customer ? think new baseline business actually sustainable even grow level ? yes . 've actually watched discussion last couple year rollout deep learning . really started lot research institution higher ed , really focused new framework . see every single hyperscale across globe focused deep learning . 's really situation breadth depth project together overall driving growth . know , continue project rollouts across hyperscales also movement enterprise well take . big market , fast grow ? size ? 's something , think early stage right deep learning u really understand scope fast could overall move . excited progress really right platform . right hardware . right development platform enabled lot deep learning well . visibility conceptually kind business ? understand lot trial , lot thing going . already somewhat good sense next one , two , three quarter might look like business ? vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kressit 's different business selling gaming card , right ? gaming card one-by- one type sale , one one type gamer . case data center business , definitely start understanding problem trying solve , understanding architecture data center . assist . long relationship relationship still yet go build across industry . really long relationship cycle seeing continue roll across many different workload many different project . 's good visibility ? 'd say good list people working , yes . okay . provide good visibility ? good list people working . thought would try . google recently announced tensorflow product , said replace cpu gpus . lot headline around . first , sort claim true , somebody like google going design product eliminates need stand-alone gpus kind thing ? 's good get good understanding technology surrounding deep learning different part deep learning . deep learning training really taking data working throwing deep neural network powerful performance 's necessary , requiring see today form factor would gpus actually training environment . see 's also use seeing inference standpoint well . taking exactly algorithm developed deep learning framework using new data also entering overall network . inference primarily used cpu easier form configuration maybe asics fpgas manner . 're also starting see gpus leveraged piece . vivek arya colette kress vivek aryaso overall ability use tpu deep learning training probably overall intention . mainly overall inference market . we're continuing work building pascal architecture came training . also gpus inference well . n't surprise someone would self-built . focus going complete deep learning process , training side inference . see sort one-off see widespread industry phenomenon ? think seeing different market smartphones , example , apple able design processor , right ? able design good processor hurt market merchant silicon smartphone processor . , understand different market . google , 's prevent facebook baidu somebody else ? overall deep learning even acceleration market using many different form factor quite . n't anything new . use custom- built asic could easily done . question performance well master overall performance . 's something 've able continue excel based overall resource development see . unlikely much custom asic design done . 's actually challenging amount investment 's necessary build . 've seen ; 've continued outperform coming new performance , new power eﬃciency going forward think 's expect . think 's , different market single use may term mobile . 's many way solve . lot investment necessary would really preclude lot people really starting part business . know harder pinpoint exact growth rate new market starting develop . , let 's say , somebody say next three four year , capex cloud guy would grow , let 's say , 10 % 15 % year colette kress vivek arya colette kressthan market opportunity , fair think could grow kind rate ? 'm asking forecast . 'm trying say investor think quantifying opportunity ? grow faster growth capex cloud player ? yes , think cloud player , focused data center throughput focused improving workload serving consumer . could , looked capex , , important part future capex investment . 're one component piece . really break overall computing architecture , material part improving throughput think architecture going forward . tend look market , data . type workload would best suited deep learning focus . look following data . 've seen lot research big data firm also looking deep learning possibility . n't think 's bad way look . 'd break capex term looking invest within . let pause see question audience gaming . talk automotive business . okay , 'll keep going . automotive , another strong area growth nvidia , much 're infotainment ? much like putting seed place autonomous driving , advanced driver assist system . forth ? think 's question say time dedication research . think infotainment business , 've infotainment business 8 10 year working automotive , premium car manufacturer , high-end infotainment system see . 10 million car road infotainment system 's car overall hit road . strategic focus build upon relationship , saw key need taking exactly understood data center solve diﬃcult challenge automotive company . looking way vivek arya colette kressautonomous driving self-driving . 's significant amount computational power 's going necessary understand everything surround car serve set instruction . many form factor ada continuing advanced ada handwritten man year ' worth algorithm written order address market . focus using deep learning , using center computing platform open scalable build toward autonomous driving . -- focus right absolutely autonomous driving building many car manufacturer tier 1 working . probably 80 different example tier 1 startup research happening term autonomous driving . majority revenue today course still infotainment world right . starting term development contract likely next 12 month platform , drive px platform , autonomous driving production set car . look competitive landscape -- automotive automotive semiconductor top mind . 's one growth area people thought would grow actually growing . see , though , competitive landscape , 's like nxp , bring diverse set product : safety microcontrollers whatnot , right ? broad set product . typical smart -- traditional smartphone company , like qualcomm , intel , approaching market smartphone mindset let worry processor . let also think touchscreen controller power management , putting lte baseband . -- look automotive opportunity , see nvidia spectrum ? enough growth stand-alone high-performance computing part car drive growth next year ? 's hard look historically space say 'll . really talking space developed term yet . car term digitalization key important part move forward . right , look average car , 50 different microprocessor within car . competition place overall play may single function type thing . focus say overall compute power , central repository absolutely necessary . 's going take time build scale highest vivek arya colette kress vivek aryalevel autonomous driving next future . transformation front u necessary . focusing single microprocessor single function evolution see going focused . 's creating connectivity central platform inside connect different camera , sensor , radar , lidar may come car going forward algorithm deal using deep learning framework . everything training data outside car , taking information , data receive car better create information going need moving forward . player , , different form factor thing may incremental today . looking 's going necessary full autonomous driving car future . got . maybe minute left talk financials . seen strong expansion gross margin last year . much business moving away legacy competitive pc market high-end product ? mix shift key trend , gross margin expansion sustainable ? continue see -- room growth gross margin ? think focus output gross margin underlying driver , mix key component . whether higher priced think platform sale value delivering often development platform layer . development tool , development library . software come much overall product . platform one specialized market go . continuing work allowed u achieve higher gross margin . mix product continue move closer higher-value product . mix driven higher margin . 's still going focus go forward see enterprise , data center business , higher gross margin company average . gaming 50 % big inﬂuence definitely term gross margin . still going concentration , n't know perfect mix fast gross margin may grow . colette kress vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kress vivek arya colette kressall right . , understand next year , reset rolloff royalty . think 's known understood . let 's say two three year , would shock see nvidia get 60 % gross margin ? referring intel licensing agreement -- final stage existing agreement . n't knowledge term way go . 's fine assume may zero would impact renew overall gross margin . aside , focus key area large tam , whether data center , whether gaming , 's absolutely opportunity gross margin go higher . 60 % ? 'm sure good exact number would sit commit . anything business prevent nvidia getting 60 % ? 's always factor come . conservatism . yes . everything portfolio company average . could higher amount . thing still work term getting . focus . right . know automotive , example , typically industry-wide lower gross margin business . something expand gross margin ? 's exact process . 's selling chip inside . 's selling lot development platform development service 've working driveworks term autonomous driving . value huge opportunity u revenue well term gross margin expansion . q - unidentified participant - colette kress q - unidentified participant - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kressquestions answer could comment intel agreement ? breadth depth agreement term access ip patent ? extend ip patent 2017 -- carry right beyond 2017 ? 's cross-license direction term license license portfolio refer capture period . capture period end first quarter next fiscal year . still access even capture period . wo n't access anything new past capture period . point leverage develop file new -- capture period finding anything filed patent period anything developed ? term fine clarity , line term detail . think easy say q1 , anything new 's put true patent would captured . term cost structure , 's also think one important aspect : 've strong control cost . last year , litigation expense litigation samsung qualcomm . settled . opportunity take invest growth opportunity ? think sort help -- actually fall bottom line ? prior year significant investment worked litigation samsung qualcomm . peak , though , probably first half last year getting ready itc case time . 've continuing wind lot high expense . 've seen relatively consistent , ﬂat overall expense base quite time . really making appropriate investment see necessary : one bringing pascal life today . also term go-to-market path 've data center new business well . q - vivek arya - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kress q - vivek aryabut continue look eﬃciencies thing rolling order manage overall operating margin company growth 'd like see . 's really going focus continue go forward : operating margin expansion , making right investment . assured continue expand margin going forward . got . look best-in-class fable company , able achieve 30 % operating margin . bad target think think nvidia ? think focusing u platform company u focus operating profitability right thing think . 're talking pretty big market front u experience overall leveraged infrastructure definitely enabled u really attack market . need make sure make investment also really achieve tam front u . 's balance fast . think pleased right non-gaap perspective right , sitting 25 % . last year , 's grown 470 basis point . 's moved quite well pleased output production , engineering . investment 've made . 'll continue focus continue focus profitability . last two quick sort rapidfire-type question . gaming product also used data center accelerator ? classification thing small thing fixating much ? 's really small thing . type researcher wanting dabble gpus easily go online get one delivered . may one high-end gaming card . may one titan . may start workstation may buy one tesla-branded one . 's good way get started , remember : one gpus programmable come programmable set get started . 's something see data center mission-critical architectural design term . sure , researcher 's gaming well researching deep learning using gpu ( multiple speaker ) . n't see big cloud guy going best buy buying lot ( end product ) . - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kress . . . . okay . last one pc oem business . 's obviously come low level . sort ﬂatten continues go ? 's insignificant part business , right ? 's material part . used material part . looking number le 10 % overall size revenue . business people need overall discrete gpu general-purpose pc . business economic standpoint lose money 'll go back design win design win back forth . overall pc market may growth market near future either . 's case , probably level follow connection overall pc market . 'll play 's economic sense . probably highly correlate overall pc market . great . right end time . thank , everyone . thank , colette . really appreciate time . thank .
