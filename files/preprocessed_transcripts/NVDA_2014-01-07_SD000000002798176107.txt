's result lot work nvidia pleased . question answer great . well thanks overview team showcasing . tegra k-1 , obviously guy working 28 nanometer silicon , think tablet 're using based tegra k-1 . correct ? yes . one . think jen-hsun showed denver-based 64-bit-based version k-1 press event sunday . guess question , team going position start shipping qualified production unit ? going - rob csongor q - harlan sur - rob csongor q - harlan sur - rob csongor q - harlan sur - rob csongor q - harlan suractually start see tegra k-1 showing customer smartphones tablet ? 2014 , 2015 ? give u sense time line ? yes , sure , year sure . okay . announced tegra k-1 , announcing demo . demo last year . sneak preview logan last year . announcing moving production . 're going see device built q1 . would expect would see device -- device start coming q2 time frame . likely , announcement -- likely announcement done close launch product -- right . -- exception last night 's announcement audi . 'm assuming first device going rolled going based quad-core a-15 architecture versus denver architecture ? fair assumption ? yes . 's right , harlan . first device coming quad-core a15 , 32-bit . 64-bit demoed last night first time . part literally come back like week ago . running . said hey , let 's show . think -- mean functioning part right . look come really second half year . okay . one trend smartphone tablet space application processor perspective -- 've seen integrated platform coming market , word , integrated apps - rob csongor q - harlan sur - rob csongorprocessor lte baseband modem . question similar tegra 4 strategy , tegra 4i integrated lte cellular connectivity . strategy 're going pursue well tk-1 ? n't announced anything . announced tegra k-1 right . n't announced kind roadmap really beyond . 's clear modem important u . one thing audi talked last night concept connected car . car going connected via lte , almost continuously . recent report came . 2017 almost every car road connected continuous basis . investment made acquiring icera recognition key component visual computing . baseband business ; visual computing business . baseband help u . case , integrated solution might make sense . case discrete solution would make sense . think -- . see . get market , think 'll unveil roadmap see make decision go . okay . relates tegra vcm automotive , think great example addressing need processing horsepower , processing capability car support thing like ada , right , thing like collision avoidance . ada requires heavy computational power running sophisticated algorithm . move intelligence car increase nvidia 's dollar content per car , looking next 1 three year ? example , take current audis shipping today -- think 's tegra 3. maybe compare partnership announcing today car . much tegra content could see next 2 three year ? could end -- would say many eight processor per car . first car nvidia really focused infotainment . say infotainment , really mean car nav . rapidly started moving car two . example , tesla sedan , guy familiar , big beautiful 17-inch display center , high-resolution moving map google earth . collaboration nvidia audi google . car two . think start introducing instrument cluster , start introducing ada , rapidly start adding -- need lot compute capability type thing . think feature feature , visual computing-intense , said , see processor . q - harlan sur - rob csongor q - harlan sur - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongor okay . obviously , design-in lead time pretty long automotive space . would envision seeing tegra k-1 vcm starting show next- generation automobile ? 's actually great question . answer long time ago would 've : take forever . actually -- started -- 2003 , actually gm automotive . closed first design win . product n't come market six year . think one thing rupert stadler talked last night keynote car evolving . car always used lag technology-wise behind consumer electronics fundamental nature car architected . vcm capability -- imagine backplane similar pc consistent architecture . new technology come , simply replace vcm put latest technology appropriate software . end result time market new technology literally gone six year couple month . think see going forward car going advance beyond capability smartphone rapidly . imagine , order pilot driving , computer vision type thing , 's level horsepower n't think smartphone today . n't see question audience . 's perfectly clear , yes . technology seems really impressive . much incremental revenue growth new product versus old ? much profitable le profitable new product ? 's good question . would say n't talked -- n't unveiled specific asp . 's lot productization lot thing happen . talked revenue growth automotive business . today , 's roughly $ 100 million business u . rapidly ramping . steadily ramping . also said largest backlog -- revenue backlog . reason bad news , harlan said , take forever get designed . get designed , get purchase order extends q - harlan sur - rob csongor q - harlan sur q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - harlan sur - rob csongorout many , many year . 's revenue backlog something lot visible u . based see , talked fact see business roughly doubling year-to-year basis $ 400 million 2016. depending fast new driver system advanced feature go . think learn lot -- 's lot design win lot thing n't able introduce talk yet . think becomes clear , 'll see lot tangible indicator revenue growth . -- doubling $ 400 million fiscal 2016 , right ? think said 2016. 2016 , okay , got . question ? could talk design win 4i ? question -- talk design win 4i ? honest answer , today . n't news date . ce actually become le le phone show . think lot people kind look mwc next stuff . tegra 4i great . news , 'll share . 've got question tegra 4. surprised win nvidia team captured xiaomi mi-3 smartphone china . know , xiaomi one fastest smartphone supplier china . mi-3 , xiaomi exclusively used qualcomm prior 2 generation phone . 're also hearing tegra 4 showing smart td-lte smartphones zte high-end china smartphone supplier . question -- performance differentiator enabling tegra 4 well , especially high-end china smartphone oems ? 's great question . think 's -- , 'll kind take question try address think one -- fundamental concept tegra . q - harlan sur q - unidentified participant - rob csongorwe get asked time , tegra succeed 're going competing mediatek qualcomm low-end phone ? always kind weird question u , similar pc market , never low-cost supplier . never competed low end pc market . 70 % pc market n't need nvidia gpu 've never sold . carve segment market visual computing matter . sell market people really value . drive large business large gross margin , good operating income , generate cash etc. , etc . pc market , segment gaming professional design . strategy tegra . see tegra low-end phone competing mediatek , qualcomm . see tegra device visual computing matter . xiaomi phone example device visual computing matter . xiaomi wanted put phone would win every benchmark china press . would outperform smartphone , outperform samsung galaxy s4 . would run best game largest android gaming market world , china . , went tegra . accomplished exactly set . phone -- know say android , automatically think phone . phone opportunity nvidia . view android opportunity tegra much , much phone . another way say critical success tegra u win every phone design . hopefully , take look new type device coming , new type tablet , see capability tegra k-1 tablet , see car , see device think 'll see coming year , think understand nvidia 's focus . got . one question back . view chromebook market suitability arm architecture nvidia 's plan ? 's great question . guy know close google collaborate lot thing . see chromebook clamshell android market kind evolving lot different type device lot different ﬂexibility different kind feature capability . today , chromebook convenient way look document , look google doc , browse web number thing . n't primary gaming platform today . , think 's see focus q - harlan sur - rob csongortoday android side . line blurring . think interesting thing going chromebook look forward talking hopefully soon . great . 're time . rob , thank much . always appreciate . thank much . thanks time .
