'd curious could elaborate little bit extent supply constraint ? importantly , think supply catch demand ? yes . thanks , john , question . q3 , busy q3 u , really exciting u continued overall ampere architecture . took opportunity take ampere architecture geforce produced geforce 30 series card market . well , came would characterize launch seeing overwhelming demand . demand geforce gamers strong laptop , desktop , channel remains lean . supply constraint supply constraint expand past seeing term wafer silicon , yes , constraint substrate component . continue work quarter supply believe though demand probably exceed supply q4 overall gaming . expect probably take couple month catch demand , time , really diﬃcult u quantify . stay focused trying get card market important holiday season , day thing continue improve , towards end quarter , 'll able provide information . colette , guided january quarter gaming sequentially , includes extra week . despite supply constraint , expecting strong january . know guide one quarter , look forward april quarter , 'm kind curious , 've got headwind losing week january april , also supply coming online . think importantly , continue introduce rtx 30 series stat , 'll notebook , 'll general product availability . april tends seasonally quarter begin gaming . thinking year ? yes . think highlighted lot different factor take consideration year , overall seasonality sometimes gaming . gaming business broken three major component , desktop , notebook overall console , different characteristic go seasonality . 've also discussed often seen strongest overall demand focus around holiday . keep mind , holiday term 're referring , holiday start early october move new year overall chinese new year , 's important piece . q - john pitzer - colette kress q - john pitzer - colette kressbut think 's important statement made , correct . ramping rtx 30 series 're starting . 're brand-new era amazing overall architecture performance leap larger performance leap done . overall review reception launch quite strong . 're going watch term see q4 q1 transition . normally sequentially . extra week q4 , could enhanced overall decline . 're going see demand get supply intact . colette , almost hate ask next question , 'm getting asked frequency would thought . bitcoin almost back kind peak level calendar year '18 , 'm getting asked question whether concerned strength -- excuse , gaming business bitcoin crypto-related . comment make especially lieu channel issue back calendar year '18 ? yes . focus term really understanding channel last couple year post-crypto continued focus enhancement really understanding level channel term real-time close real- time information get term overall channel . crypto question , interest channel , nobody aware real demand time crypto . 's helpful . near-term question october quarter data center business . think excellent job kind explaining call afterwards inﬂuence mellanox october going january . think one concern 've heard post conference call , think core growth rate core data center business . mean , clearly 're going product ramp well , a100 ramping , b100 ramping , 've seen growth rate year-over- year basis decelerate unsustainably high 200 % plus respectable 40 % . kind model conservatively sequentially , 're quickly getting sort maybe 20 % year-over-year growth . think kind normalized year-over-year growth data center impact might macro data center business today ? yes . rest group , let try summarize little bit term experienced q3 overall guided q4 . overall q3 result data center yet another record level , record level term nvidia compute , overall record level term mellanox . expected overall sequential increase stem primarily nvidia core compute , also saw strong growth term mellanox q2 q3 , largely due china oem purchase n't feel would repeat overall q4 . q - john pitzer - colette kressso record level mellanox could n't pleased performance first couple week , first couple quarter nvidia . done tremendous . 've even excited term integration effort term working future product together . compute business , think nvidia compute , continues ramp overall a100 . a100 started several quarter ago term launching hyper-scales around world many hyperscales speed-of- light quickness term creating overall cloud instance overall a100 , adoption worldwide across cloud create cloud instance . q3 quarter u also create opportunity expand server oems , server oems building overall enterprise , building industry serving overall edge computing . also came release dgxs , dgx superpods also support important part industry . pleased adoption overall scale getting overall a100 . 's several year since launched overall v100 . breadth depth customer base expanded significantly , term understanding accelerated computing ai , focus term providing software capability connect platform application . 're able serve many industry couple year ago continue build investment . move q3 q4 , still expect sequential increase nvidia compute . ramp a100 , mellanox , amazing strong quarter q3 . move forward , 're still early day a100 , importantly , 're early day ai accelerated computing . well , colette , guy ' credit , 've kind leaned forward product cycle driving data center business , 's got -- look macro year fact enterprise went work home mode , sort impact business , especially second-half . look server demand enterprise 's 40 % year-over-year . sort rebound expect core enterprise get next year vaccine get widely distributed ? yes , 's really good question say covid pandemic plus minus company benefitted , 're company really struggled . think 's important understand piece inﬂuenced data center enterprise . q - john pitzer - colette kressso look term proviz business , 's example say , overall proviz business purchasing overall oems.at initial onset pandemic , real struggle get overall component building challenge overall supply ecosystem build . additionally , support work home ? saw q3 , really interesting proviz started see sequential increase returning back super strong result term workstation mobile workstation , oems enterprise found way procure build important market working home . , believe 's coming back . think data center think enterprise , 're general purpose overall enterprise purchasing . focused accelerated ai , initial year build workload . important area many company rethink investment , continue invest overall ai . cloud important part working home use overall cloud continue work expanding accelerated ai see result . believe overall business continuing work challenge pandemic find way reach overall enterprise hope get better quarter come . colette , 's great summary near-term issue . maybe step back ask longer-term , open-ended question . mean , nvidia always extremely rich history parallel compute . initially leveraged gaming market . lot hard work . brought hpc broader data center . 've silicon company . strong software element offering acquisition mellanox proposed acquisition arm , 're broadening even . maybe spend minute step back reset kind think value proposition nvidia offer investment community ? 's kind overarching strategy ? yes . think 've watched much transformation last decade even decade longer . transformation really moving away chip company focused gaming . moved become overall computing company , computing company focused history computing , future computing future accelerated computing , u many decade going forward . order scale accelerated computing use overall ai , required full stack approach approach overall market , meaning , still thinking silicon , thinking best performance get q - john pitzerfor overall hardware , also focused system software , full stack really differentiates u going necessary achieve transformation accelerated computing go forward . overall work focusing hardware performance , addressing need stitching together software , many case , easing adoption providing end-to-end system plug overall market . 've able , full entire staff , rapidly expand ecosystem faster 've ever done past . 2.3 million developer . 1,800 gpu-accelerated application time received 6 million cuda downloads alone 2020. feat lot work full generation , still lot new thing address market . platform touch broad market . platform built specifically one overall application , build often market early day thing think strong growing market future . 've created platform rtx . rtx platform like ray tracing platform . multi-year making also includes ai . think overall real-time ray tracing also putting ai hand ray tracing going forward something others done , take platform approach also workstation , data center automotive , hgx platform , egx edge platform well agx platform autonomous platform . every single one platform begin unified architecture addressing overall end market important piece , software . written much software specific industry . 've seen difference software help people bring ai . talk clara , talk jarvis , mervin , many thing metropolis overall drive car . point equal amount software hardware engineering focusing market . step back look future entail , mellanox , focused end-to-end computing , computing n't start overall data reach overall gpu , start want compute data . 're thinking everything interconnects dpu , overall gpu performance well , matter long-term think accelerated computing . well , collette , maybe spend little time talking application framework . talked clara , drive , jarvis , isaac , merlin , metropolis ; mean software stack 're building . historically , 've always viewed nvidia chip company 's able capture value ecosystem go . look core gaming growth , 's 30 % annual growth , compound annual growth last five year . 's amazing half asp value capture . talk little bit application framework maybe discus , brings specifically conversation announcement made mercedes-benz earlier year ? - colette kress q - john pitzer - colette kress yes , think value people continue come back nvidia value , overall development community . developer want work developer n't working , meaning leverage work developer built well work term nvidia done term expanding ecosystem . work come linking together overall connectivity way hardware , system software , overall framework right get overall application customer ecosystem know okay . building upon really continue stay nvidia know nvidia continue innovate . people buy overall system overall price point really innovation software incorporated . never situation manufacturing cost plus much software ecosystem much overall software come every single one platform . take u important part talk overall daimler mercedes , overall investment making . daimler come endorsed full end-to-end platform autonomous vehicle . future , entire ﬂeet av harmonized nvidia drive platform hardware provide , also maintain share software realize , way kind think purchasing av card want overall av package , av package come high thousand dollar split daimler overall nvidia . really transformation way oem manufacturer think going build strategy av partnership nvidia . could n't excited agreement , investment daimler made u really pas industry whole term think building av . colette , start run number mercedes deal , 's actually diﬃcult kind 10-year useful life car make argument recurring software revenue could large initial system sale ? thinking right way , one ? two , embark strategy , think five , six , seven year , much revenue business think going recurring nature ? yes , 's really good way analyze . 're talking cost overall hardware chip . really talking keeping overall software capability speed going new update way ownership car . 're correct , 's long-term overall revenue stream easily overall daimler reach term billion [ ph ] . q - john pitzer - colette kress q - john pitzerso 're really pleased great opportunity really build automotive business . 'd say much percentage automotive business going forward ? may material part automotive business along thinking way also serve market hardware platform well , future , strategy . 's long-term strategy really good case strategy coming ( inaudible ) . clear colette , auto first tangible example revenue sharing software , assume application framework provide opportunity industry guy talk believe $ 60 billion ai tam addition mellanox , seems beyond channel , thinking right way ? tam overall automotive , talking expansion . asked term overall software , extend platform ? absolutely could . anything specific thing may working , absolutely , great opportunity n't want take care software something nvidia help software license . 're pleased broadens people 's thinking enterprise otherwise industry leverage software ease deployment available accelerated computing . expanded overall tam , overall think expansion bringing overall mellanox overall business . allowed u focus accelerated computing surrounding gpu , focus also thinking interconnects importance full system . we're pleased term expansion dc tam . look 2024 , probably close $ 100 billion inclusion overall mellanox still broken key component hyper sale still important part , also key customer mellanox business probably $ 45 billion overall $ 100 billion tam . move enterprise , enterprise probably next key component tam expanded probably $ 30 billion introduction mellanox . additionally , edge ai position $ 15 billion high performance computing also key component mellanox well u $ 10 billion . think guy done good job last several year debunking myth 're strong machine learning training , strong inference . talk little bit positioning inference ? think augmenting silicon software , important become incremental mode competition ? - colette kress q - john pitzer - colette kress yes , . open term indicating going move take good look overall inferencing could even accelerate work 're inferencing . inferencing cpu market , inferencing stage probably simplistic overall inferencing market focused low end binary type inferencing needed done . , seen last couple year really endorsed use gpu inferencing key . one , overall complexity inferencing , overall approach overall training deal natural language processing focus conversational ai recommenders really expanded inferencing market overall complexity multi-stage inferencing problem . period time , seen focus programmability gpu , performance gpu solve diﬃcult overall inferencing example talking . 've seen last quarter q3 , key specific inferencing product continues reach record level within quarter . came a100 , remember a100 unique overall architecture allows -- decide whether going used training used inferencing . could could one . overall ﬂexibility aided cloud provider well internal use began training also see continues move overall inferencing . seeing amount inferencing gpus cloud exceeded overall compute capacity cpu , short amount period time . 're pleased adoption . 're pleased term people seeing important area accelerated computing going forward . colette , feel like could talk another hour-and-a-half still hit issue . 're coming end time , thought 'd end one question around financials . 're one company cover n't target gross op margin . 'm wondering , talk little bit near-term longer-term inﬂuences gross margin op margin . specifically , gross margin , think product launch maturation sort cost margin time . think software becoming bigger part mix mean gross margin ? op margin , think kind desire want accelerate opportunity r & , sg & versus able put healthy operating margin ? yes . let 's focus gross margin first . gross margin really simply number one thing want think gross margin inﬂuenced mix inﬂuenced software . mean absence software cost help gross margin , software cost q - john pitzer - colette kressdown r & . , people purchasing platform full capability aiding overall application benefit gross margin . many platform fully software-rich still say . 's mix mix becomes one largest driver gross margin . faster growing business higher gross margin inﬂuences uptick overall gross margin total . last quarter , saw surge moving strong growth gaming , strong growth gaming moving q3 q4 . strong margin , 'll relatively ﬂat period time . time data center gross margin growth rapid growth data center improved overall company gross margin . focus -- launch overall initial onset product per architecture , yes , gross margin improve time . start quite healthy even get better , 's type company , 're going focus making great . 'll see usually couple quarter get long-term preferred overall gross margin . let 's focus operating margin , 's correct . n't overall long-term goal operating margin , think shareholder carefully , think investment carefully . make investment largest growing market front u sit carefully figure make investment many thing see u producing today began 5 10 year ago , 's long haul u make decision investment thinking large overall market . count u giving framework begin new year much 're going spend , know , 's control . ca n't control market overall demand . come tell , 're going spend much believe right amount investment large thing going forward . historically , proven working u . , think 're going continue path investing , investing right producing shareholder value overall leverage done expansion operating margin . 's great . 've come end fireside chat , colette , want thank participating wish , immediate family extended family safe healthy rest 2020. 's trying year lot u looking forward 2021. agree . thank hosting . happy holiday . q - john pitzer take care .
