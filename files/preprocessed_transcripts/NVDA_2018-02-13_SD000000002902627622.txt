( discussed ) group grew double digit . case data center business , many people follow quite closely , reached almost $ 2 billion grew 130 % year-over-year . extremely strong growth overall platform . big year volta platform . volta platform ( blended ) data center announced gtc last may . probably greatest surprise greatest accomplishment overall adoption volta across overall industry , starting cst moving quite quickly internal use term training . also capability using within cloud . seeing many cloud instance come day , using overall volta architecture . ( let 's ) take away overall gaming business , grew quite strong . quite strong pascal architecture 've in-market 1.5 year , tremendous success term keeping heart mind overall gamers well bringing new gamers overall market . pro vi business established term high-end market well design . important piece transformation pro visualization think use ai use virtual reality much design 's taking place enterprise well , started business , growing double digit . automotive business , also growing 10 % , really associated infotainment system . probably key highlight many announcement 've made throughout year term partnership many auto manufacturer , start-ups , partner , tier 1 automotive industry focus self-driving car . 're pleased term overall revenue growth also come term overall gross margin . know , business shipping overall chip . best hardware . also full stack software many industry 're . started year , lot concern term absence internal royalty , going expire first quarter , . ended still growing overall gross margin 100 basis point , including term 130 basis point direction absence intel royalty . growing 200 basis point term true operation really showing value platform , full stack term people appreciating 're able see term overall gross margin . invested business . invested business , growing opex nearly 20 % . also producing overall operating income margin expansion . margin increased 500 basis point year-over-year . think tremendously great model leveraged overall r & team . mean leverage focus one product . focus gpu . 're able build term best-of-breed . also work software stack take one specific market . benefited u well think overall investment . overall profitability growth growing 60 % , even term overall eps line . summary , really solid year . taking advantage great , large market opportunity front u . fortunate thing front u we're q - toshiya hari - colette m. kressnot concentrating one large market . many large market . gaming , gaming . tremendously healthy . 'll get point maybe every person world overall gamer . platform best-of-breed able really fuel lot gaming high-end gaming see right high-production game coming . many saw holiday season well overall content game demand higher-end overall graphic . additionally , advancement 're seeing term artificial intelligence , use gpu democratizing lot 're seeing term first stage ai , large market front u . 's great see progress year . also progress opportunity going forward . automotive autonomous driving extension seen data center , hard problem solve using artificial intelligence build self-driving car future , whether level 3 , level 4 level 5 going forward . 're excited . 're excited future . great . thanks much . guess , hoping could walk u business formation -- transformation nvidia gone past five year . since joined company , lot happened . stock $ 15 . 're sitting today $ 230 ; 's completely different company . walk u change opportunity different today relative joined company ? got . joining company five year ago , discussion would term onstage today versus term ( 5 year ) , 's tremendous transformation . actually feel transform every day take ( part ) term market . yes . brand-new company , 25 year making . lot really based really strong core technology gpu used even back . primarily overall pc platform . five year really n't talk actual transformation . actually go back little bit farther . yes . pc platform great piece u start importance overall processing capability . graphic essentially great application use processing capability gpu . happened probably 10 12 year ago establishment programmability gpu enabling many . establishing cuda . establishing cuda several different gpus available time , allowed u build overall developer base today . developer base grown astronomically , exceeds 600,000 developer worldwide , established success today , data center well pro vi maybe even term artificial intelligence future autonomous driving . reason find use case tremendous overall processor solve many challenging problem required much data much processing put together . yes , five year ago would talking pc market , pc market would declining would ﬂat ( ) concern term attach rate . 's long time since 've question . really , really talk , stage q - toshiya hari - colette m. kresswe term ai ? big going ? first self-driving car hit freeway ? see ? huge change . 's required company keep toe . think company probably one agile company really focused leading-edge thing 're changing evolve company reach market opportunity . great . guess , wanted dive segment start data center given focus guy focus investor well . clearly , major growth driver today . walk u individual subsegments within data center performed past 12 month ? sure . data center business essentially focused 5 different business within . first one , probably good percentage overall business , focused ai training . ai training requires significant amount data , process called deep learning , allows process data writing software . allowing infer large set overall data . still significant part business started early stage csps , hyperscale provider well use training application internally well application use consumer standpoint overall internet . business continued evolve continued grow . second key business emerged emerged quite well last year cloud business . using overall application hyperscales research team . serving different user enterprise researcher get started quite quickly . quite differently , maybe -- infrastructure built maybe 10 15 year ago , would self- build cluster within data center , allowing ease use researcher , start-ups , well entrant term enterprise use cloud get quickly started ai get quickly started deep learning . 's many different use case overall cloud instance . focus creating cloud instance big piece last year . 'd say sizing quite well overall deep learning training 're seeing first business . third business focused inferencing . inferencing take different stage ai , data already trained 're going focus new incremental data coming processing speed , usually referred per second , image per second , instance per second , type case . super early stage business using overall gpu . traditionally , done primarily done cpu market . 're getting complexity type work need done , analyzing video , example , analyzing voice gpu processor actually tremendously beneficial . super early stage term market . 're going continue focus future large market u overall capture . fourth market high-performance computing . new business , business 've probably close 15 year . large supercomputer around world . , deep computational type work done high- performance computing . established term top supercomputer world , probably 1/5 ; well top 15 q - toshiya hari - colette m. kress q - toshiya hari - colette m. kressoverall application high-performance computing using overall gpu acceleration . sped year realizing slowdown moore 's law , slowdown using general cpu improve performance time time . using something else accelerate overall performance supercomputing gpus established . little bit different ai . 're seeing term conversion , conversion high-performance computing ai together take thing infer using ai deep computational transaction also using term high- performance computing . 've long design win market likely continue . 's really great part business year . last business really focused ai edge , autonomous machine , people using centrally data center . machine ( pc ) going forward . also great opportunity think smart city , think autonomous vehicle ; 're still going significant amount work term putting platform . different business within data center today . okay . mentioned 's ( early gain ) inferencing . recent call , think jensen talked opportunity . help u understand big business today within data center view opportunity next , say , 12 24 month ? yes . , business data center today , majority stem training cloud , high-performance computing . inferencing still early stage , wide set partner . overall ( trailing ) , overall inferencing . see inferencing occurring many part world , within hyperscale application well . 's still early part business term representative data center business . okay , understood . , guess , term competitive landscape data center . clearly , given growth potential , multiple competitor aggressively going market 've got private supposedly emerging sometime year solution well . remind u value proposition nvidia differ competition ? sure . mean , think artificial intelligence , course , would lot interest around world , folk interested part . long term , sure , 's going many different player artificial intelligence . 've simply come overall focus , focus enabling ai many different platform many different place around world , focusing one framework , focusing one hyperscale , focusing one form computing . ability create software stack enables , allows quick start term working q - toshiya hari - colette m. kress q - toshiya hari - colette m. kresssignificant amount metalware . confused . always best processor capable handling significant amount data . democratize ai many different type population -- researcher , lab , higher education enterprise well hyperscales without aligning single one platform really focus . thing develop long term , probably specialty within . see u looking extend work certain industry , certain vertical probably add software enable , example , health care software help term overall manufacturing arm use ai . really , available almost different type platform . guess , specifically yesterday , get quite question investor amazon announcement google announcement well . perhaps address issue well ? sure . -- 's discussion people refer ( custom service ) . time customization ? see player looking customization specific workload ? nothing new essentially emerged yesterday . google coming gpu ( 2 ) . 're allowing beta version cloud 've seen . strategy still remains , focused different cloud provider , focused different framework enabling . nothing new term piece . amazon , way , chip single kind device , necessarily large autonomous machine . although would probably focused -- device coming chip specific . okay . make sense . shifting gear little bit . wanted ask couple question crypto , given focus . call last week , talked part business bigger percentage business q4 relative q3 . know 's really hard gauge big business . help u understand relative size see going next , say , ( 4 ) quarter ? sure . -- probably interesting part last year , fiscal 2018 , emergence ( overhead ) cryptocurrency , necessarily brand new . several year ago , cryptocurrency popped term bitcoin mining . moved overall asics take place . right , current currency , using gpu beneficial work need done . last couple quarter , 've watched quite closely . important market dynamic popping , professional miner starting take place . also case extra time outside gaming people also mining . may dual q - toshiya hari - colette m. kress q - toshiya hari - colette m. kress q - toshiya harioverall function term 're seeing , use gpus consumer side . 's tough gauge . 's extremely tough gauge . think selling term gpus , gpus gaming gpus crypto sold -- adding card maker , sold exact channel . case , maybe exact customer , gaming part time well also mining . understand probably looking valuation overall gaming believe amount work need done , believe market grew time q3 time q4 . see . able pinpoint exactly something capability may dual . probably evolved since couple quarter ago -- market dynamic getting critical mass . critical mass amount happening cryptocurrency . probably underlying trend time . carrying forward , yes , . still volatile ? absolutely . okay . way manage potential decline crypto pricing gpus ﬂooding market ? hard manage ? stage , 'm sure path , given volatility overall coin . 'm sure 'll see additional coin future . 's hard tell point . okay , got . , guess , talking gaming business , still well north 50 % ( inaudible ) . get little air time day given data center crypto . 2017 , another strong year . mostly crypto gaming well ? drove strength 2017 's kind outlook 2018 ? gaming business still growing strong . definitely see success see lot game coming . pubg , example , probably one best game 2017 came . started early back fall . late , reached 25 million , 30 million different user . gamers . new gamers . gamers moved new game . play , continuing upgrade overall pascal cycle , thinking gpus . tremendous success . towards latter half fiscal year , though , challenge gamers crypto miner . point , 're supply constrained . gpus lot need meet lot different thing . yes , overall success gaming clearly seen revenue growth . also think overall success growth game . easily see . - colette m. kress q - toshiya hari q - unidentified participant - colette m. kressgreat . competitive standpoint , 've clearly done really well gaming past couple year , gaming share expense nearest competitor . going forward , view landscape ? intel talked coming back -- 've got discrete graphic business well . multiyear basis , see competitive positioning changing , ? yes . think focus addressing gamers , company , unique strategy address overall gaming market . many competitor , thought chip would establish overall gaming platform much differently focus . focus term surrounding overall ecosystem overall gamers . providing geforce experience , providing overall seamlessness gpu overall playing game . remember , 're continuously working many game developer bring life many great feature inside game . graphic intensive , working hand-in-hand many month game ever even come . different approach term befriending overall gamers well- established channel know reach overall gamers inﬂuences gamers coming back time time . trusted value best processing capability . also great seamlessness understanding overall gaming industry . competitor n't changed much . 've competitor 20-some-odd year . inﬂuenced high-end type gamers well early entrant . early entrant continuing use nvidia product meet different need , whether $ 100 spend whether want top- of-the-line $ 1,000 gpu gaming , something . think competition always . , 's tough nut crack . 's something take couple month . strategy well ingrained system , ecosystem . think 's stay . okay . great . 8 minute left . still bunch question . wanted make sure question audience ? 's one right ( seventh ) row . think mentioned earlier last year different driver used crypto mining versus normal gaming . able tell difference gpus using -- used crypto one used mining -- sorry , gaming ? think latest crypto stuff , people using latest nvidia driver 's hard differentiate , right ? think one thing still , overclock memory . able figure percentage gpus 're selling like memory overclock versus normal overclock ? q - toshiya hari q - unidentified participant - colette m. kressokay . let -- room , talked last year . yes . brought market specific overall gpu card specifically cryptocurrency market . captured gaming business . captured oem business . essentially see overall oem business . differ also n't graphic . 're really overall computation . yes . still selling overall card . overall price increase seen cryptocurrency valuation within q4 , people bought . also moved buy regular gpus , caused significant amount supply constraint moving also regular overall gpus . could planning gaming mining together . second question memory overclock type thing . something specifically see remember , still n't even perfect understanding pure miner , gamer ? see merge . necessarily overall data figure term overclocking . overclocking something new . 's something folk expert along term gaming , use gpus . overall ( inaudible ) choose best type clocking overall game . 'm sure also may -- possibly ( ) cryptocurrency . 're sure . question ? term process -- term product autonomous side , -- sense think level 4 , level 5 autonomous , 's time line ? -- see automaker versus intermediate company better ready -- 's better placed today ready level 4 , level 5 ? okay , sure . n't opportunity talk auto . good opportunity . drive px platform . 's many different part px platform autonomous driving car . important piece want people understand probably transform lot within year , one , earlier year , people really started believe understand autonomous driving going probably take place without ai ; really , really ai problem , able process data around car nanosecond type order create path overall car function going key . what's also interesting discussion regarding level 3 , level 4 level 5. move term level 5 , level 5 essentially say steering wheel , brake pedal , essentially driver . want move way level 5 , go serial processing say 'm going get level 3 , i'm going add level 4 level 5. probably . introduced pegasus platform within year . pegasus platform focused primarily level 4 level 5 , may level 5 confined type community area , several block radius , college campus , downtown area . 's area could actually map quite heavily could actually bring process market remove driver quite quickly functioning . thinking q - toshiya hari - colette m. kressabout bringing level 5 need car drive san francisco new york , probably necessary today . rather thinking ( coming day ) . additionally , level 3 moving advancement high-end level 2 overall safety feature certain scenario , would able drive , whether freeway driving , whether parking lot park car , et cetera , 'll also probably near term . time likely see robotaxis certain community well level 3 , may time . already tesla car road today , functioning overall platform . 've announced continued work , audi , pilot term volvo well many different robotaxis term u.s .. also international term area . asked discussion auto manufacturer thinking involved ? actually , different type stage different approach term want address market . really want part shuttle , want part robotaxis . others would continue similarly high-end infotainment system creating high- end car , autonomous driving point . unique market versus people put car year , 's start ﬂeet car . 're talking transportation industry whole . affecting transportation service . see , overall partnership uber , think ﬂeet without driver . affect term trucking overall hauling material across country . think using ai scenario improve safety overall eﬃciency term market . 's u.s. market . 's tremendous amount work china . overall start-ups car company . also term european term significant amount ﬂeets focus term . probably one largest transformation transportation 've seen last 100 year . 's going take different start different finish based quickly move area . colette , wanted finish asking ability expand margin going forward . 've done great job growing gross margin , operating margin past several year . personally think mix improvement alone would drive gross margin higher . time , expanding opex pretty fast rate . think ability grow margin going forward ? yes . company 's focused -- really higher-end value platform . 's really underlying machine regarding overall profitability overall margin expansion . 's interesting focus . gross margin , see cost platform term actual component . reality value often tremendous amount work software engineer , hardware engineer create full end-to-end platform . work overall opex . work unified structure support multiple different platform together focus one thing , ( inaudible ) enable . whole combination allowed u grow top line gross margin people expand higher value-added platform also allowing u think thoughtfully term investment q - toshiya hari - colette m. kress q - toshiya hariin term opex . right measure certainly overall margin , overall operating profit . reached probably close $ 3.5 billion profit year . even fourth quarter , expanded margin close 40 % . still tool front u go forward focusing higher end platform . 'll see fast go . want make sure 're true initial -- excuse , additional investment 's going required business think complexity platform going forward . still make sure investing internally customer take advantage gpus 're using . great . thank . much . , 're time . colette , , thank taking time u today . thank . thank . thanks much .
