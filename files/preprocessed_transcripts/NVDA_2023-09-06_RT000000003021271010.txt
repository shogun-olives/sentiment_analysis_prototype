, good morning , , welcome evercore isi semi & semi equipment conference . matthew prisco , semiconductor analyst . morning , pleasure welcoming colette kress , cfo nvidia accompanying valuable discussion . believe colette celebrating 10th anniversary nvidia cfo month , period nvidia seen modest gain transitioned pc unit play eye many accelerated compute powerhouse today . , welcome , colette . thank joining u congratulation hugely successful journey . thank . question answer ( question answer ) , format chat , number question run , we'll save time end audience q & . start , two main - colette kress q - matthew prisco - colette kressbuckets , 're fielding question today . around data center sustainability supply . , kicking sustainability side , particularly data center revenue 3q position tripled 1q level . would love hear thought 's driving confidence sequential growth . maybe close working customer infrastructure build-out strategy ? thinking potential pent- demand data center gpus today ? okay . thanks u . make opening statement -- sure . -- say , reminder , presentation contains forward-looking statement investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business . okay . , let 's first talk thing regarding demand . 's sustainability demand term 're seeing . strong visibility well strong interest term product . lot stemmed opening openai 's chatgpt holiday 's increasingly interesting time related . people really started understand simplicity using ai many enterprise , whether think monetization standpoint new product could whether see ai term eﬃciency everything . demand seeing requires u spend quite bit time planning many customer . customer see today customer also sometimes decade , working work term inside data center . think important opening statement say supplying chip . look data center computing company helping create data center future . data center future 've talked associated ai important killer app see , really along accelerated computing think take consistently see future . growth see really looking improve eﬃciency data center , working sustainability data center , use energy , also really allowing work 've able accomplish without accelerated computing . , yes , working many company helping term data center build , helping term planning look term solution . large language model right front-and-center using product help building large language model ; q - matthew prisco - colette kress q - matthew priscofuture 'll see inferencing related model built . keep mind 's couple different use case , also see use recommendator engine , use many form extracting substantial amount data using data accelerate computing well . , thing 're seeing across customer . 's perfect . foundational model build-outs clearly focus area today . think number model need built long could drive training demand ? maybe initial model built training focus shift towards fine-tuned iteration specific application model maintenance adjusting drift whatnot , enough training demand fully utilize current build-out we're seeing ? , discussion foundational model come front-and-center . 's one two three different foundational model created . 's created different country , different region world , well specific area . one type model 'll see . 'll see additional model often related specifically company . company may look two different type well . internally using data , information help fuel inside company , also help customer term call center building model , answer type call . , foundational model important part training , continue see model built otherwise . , architecture built term lot system bring market today associated capability training moving inferencing stage training process . extremely helped eﬃciencies data center , dual use . 'll see build model , work term inferencing may even come back make adjustment model time continue build . leaf great infrastructure best training , also , sizable inferencing market future well . , think 'll see . inferencing related massive amount data may consumer internet company use . see company microsoft considering use inferencing platform help . also see gcp , example , looking offering well . , inferencing training important go forward . okay . , 2023 seemingly year training build , build come extreme compute requirement lofty asp . model begin increasingly move production mix , skews towards inference side , think impact nvidia ? risk pressure - colette kress q - matthew prisco - colette kressthe fall asp type digestion period customer kind take training build leverage infrastructure ? think work 's done training , lot spent time thinking size model , thinking parameter would necessary type training . determined amount interested term purchasing . position helping company even form ai accelerated computing really tco saving realize . nothing better infrastructure save money , save energy work . what's determined pricing . pricing look say value help save single chip , data center whole . saving pas part work 've done pricing we'll use reinvestment back company . set price , set price beginning relatively keep price throughout ownership selling two different architecture . , see going forward ? although 're position ai looking generative ai , 's important piece right . probably important inﬂection people understanding need focus $ 1 trillion installed base x86 cpu type infrastructure 's . time think make even eﬃcient ; think moving installed base accelerated computing , necessarily generative ai , different form computing happen . 'll likely see transition move generative ai moving accelerated computing long term well . , 's benefit thinking purchasing move towards accelerated computing ownership data center total . make sense . moving proliferation large language model ; seeing split customer creating model scratch versus leveraging foundational model fine-tuning meet need ? maybe different scenario impact nvidia differently ? yeah . foundational model , using infrastructure many large company build foundational model one foundational model , upgrade foundational model time . thing enterprise company building different model . continue support well . may supported many different factor , one thing helpful model -- pre-trained model either available and/or thing nemo , bionemo help term optimizing model well . q - matthew prisco - colette kress q - matthew prisco - colette kresswe software , service continue support many company build model . receive request time . model great shape . 's working 80 % . help u term optimize ? , nvidia key infrastructure need , also software support . 's perfect . thinking inference market particular , majority today processed cpu , generative-ai-based model move production , think gpu opportunity maybe put differently , think percentage new inference-based build-outs , best supported gpus kind 's driving view ? , look infrastructure , 's little bit diﬃcult u differentiate determine exact amount time spent training inferencing . however , believe inferencing large market , likely larger long term term 're seeing . 'll continue selling system , also specific system leveraged specifically inferencing . 's important piece folk looking thinking cost every step inferencing platform . cost course going important also sustainability energy , lowest form energy use move inferencing position . , platform help term think 'll continue driver inferencing . inferencing become extremely complex time . inferencing 20-30 year ago using cpu work , rather binary type decision inferencing . today , complex model inferencing latency 's required lot time end use important piece gpus perfectly set help . right . clear . , 'd like move supply , major area 're fielding question . maybe help u understand disconnect approach many taking correlating cost capacity growth nvidia 's gpu shipment growth capability . obviously , correlation holding currently . , missed ? maybe help u better understand thinking supply backdrop potential expansion ? , highlighted earnings plan supply . continued ramp supply quarter moving forward even go fiscal year '25 . we've working across board different supplier help improve supply position support many customer demand put front u . mean looking lot different thing , adding additional q - matthew prisco - colette kress q - matthew prisco - colette kresssuppliers , adding additional capacity , qualifying , also looking term time spent improving cycle time whole across supply chain . thing 've worked . colos important piece term putting together . 's form packaging really lot high-end type chip type thing . keep mind , multiple supplier add colos improve overall size supply , 've done . 'll see part ramp bring supplier . okay . , mentioned development qualification new supplier key step manufacturing process . , first , add maybe color nvidia 's involvement investment developing supply chain ? second , build supplier base , think qualification process mitigate maybe quality concern utilization le mature source ? okay . first , starting partnership supplier , many partner u 30 year company , well even multiple decade , partnership important . try continue treat supplier best . case , may going faster supplier . , helping work together term improve supply scenario work . look think supply , may look inventory . reality looking purchase commitment well sometimes prepaids , helping supplier quickly bring capacity quickly bring supply going thing . get understanding long term purchase commitment capacity agreement helpful 'll continue . move forward , going forward taking folk need qualified additional help term bringing , 's process work together . right quality standpoint . supplier new supplier . 've serving part business 've serving different customer . , feel good type customer see supply chain quality really issue . 're right u . perfect . think potential supply limitation , causing heavier mix hopper overall would expected ? , maybe could offer color stand hopper adoption curve today , compare prior cycle think moving forward ? q - matthew prisco - colette kress q - matthew priscoso , hopper ; hopper current generation architecture data center . market probably close year . 's something launched last fall . keep mind , even launched last fall , something continued improve relationship customer , knowing 's coming , helping qualify , helping really understand engineering behind , equally adopted quickly see lot product . , hopper important architecture . 'll continue see u time using hopper . 's interesting something 've always seen well prior architecture often sold time . , selling hopper ampere . ampere architecture , 's also second best architecture market . ? sold ? well , many people already qualified ampere . still qualifying hopper . 's great opportunity add additional ampere project they're . may move second stage project changing architecture may ideal continuing ampere . , even second quarter , sold volume standpoint equal ampere hopper . know 'll see hopper continue ramp even see next couple quarter . right . perfect . , prior data center revenue explosion past two quarter , guy highlighted vision acceleration attach roughly mid- single digit , growing 100 % next 10 year . given recent uptick , thinking stand today journey 100 % look like ? maybe color could offer term workload transition timing potential milestone , anything would helpful . yes . , statement 're making looking single digit percent currently within data center . data center across world , look full view term understanding modern data center right quite disaggregated . , goal percentage data center whole , necessarily counting server counting individual type chip . think 's right way look thing data center perspective . 're right . vision focus accelerated computing within data center important piece . movement generative ai , easy understanding really inﬂuenced folk looking accelerated computing , key ai application , also term long term say conserving energy finding way densify work really important tco value . , 're journey . fast get 100 % , 's going really , really hard determine . , powerful inﬂection point u continue even past generative ai move accelerated computing . - colette kress q - matthew prisco - colette kressand path 100 % data center accelerated , limiter thinking full data center system could pressure slope adoption curve , whether 's hardware , software , ecosystem ? , step taken kind push front ? 's important piece understand . think u data center computing company provide , sure , gpu system important , keep mind , also ability adopt cpu help overall acceleration process . acquisition mellanox use networking really understand importance networking many high volume system . amount traﬃc come inside data center unique focusing network acceleration important . 's step back look moment data probably entered data center , accelerate work ? networking , nvlink , cpu , gpus , importantly , software , development platform , end-to-end stack help way application key term adoption accelerated computing . without help , working important time get application re-routed using accelerated computing work . think full platform inﬂuencing ease adoption ease moving accelerated computing faster anything 've seen . okay . envision world full acceleration , thinking split gpus , asics , potential accelerator maybe percent total compute best served gpus ? area potentially remain better suited alternative ? 's tough determine success custom asic different type accelerator , think 's important understand data center acceleration . sure , form accelerated chip , 's lot different type accelerator . accomplishing work . actually diﬃcult determine size success . world , thing moving quite quickly , changing quite quickly almost type application going forward form ai . ai still early journey . customizing specific asic , hard coding specific asic make diﬃcult , thing moving fast beneficial probably take several year accomplish custom asic . others may specific workload size , static type workload could see customizing form accelerator . that's something always existed . possibly small different type option . focus get adoption platform q - matthew prisco - colette kress q - matthew prisco - colette kressall different part platform give customer much choice possible think build future . okay . 're clearly multiyear investment cycle lot spend going accelerated compute platform . think attach rate growing , even 20 % , amount gpu spend becomes quite significant . thinking growth end-use case justify level investment ? think 'll strong enough pull customer continue pay additional ai functionality ? 're seeing today , something simple generative ai lot different piece really explaining enterprise simplicity using ai many different form ai improve business . , long term , see application move accelerated and/or incorporate ai . journey begun part u probably half decade well . see consumer internet company , see , large cloud company also working term recommendator engine , working moving significant amount inferencing work site search cam ad , thing need marketing product , , key accelerated computing using ai .
