good morning , everyone . day 2 crãƒâ©dit suisse annual technology conference . thanks joining u . thrilled delighted dave o'hara , cfo cloud enterprise , oï¬ƒce , dynamic , ai research microsoft . dave , welcome . thank . begin , asked read safe harbor statement microsoft . begin , microsoft may make forward-looking statement presentation . refer sec filing risk factor relating business . 's true whether 're person listening web . question answer way , dave , welcome . maybe -- audience member , could give u little bit background role microsoft . sure . thanks . well simplest way describe , michael , think 'm cfo commercial business , includes cloud business . cut across cloud enterprise oï¬ƒce artificial intelligence research many area . 's current role . came microsoft acquisition great plain many year ago , worked dynamic business q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'harawhile , cfo online business cfo oï¬ƒce cloud enterprise . sort came together . basically , everything kind grows microsoft 're responsible . everything . would say 's unique position satya push unpredictable consistent growth . lot lever pull . think within remix , lot really good healthy growing business . 've microsoft 17 year . 've seen couple different ceo position . satya 's come . attribute success microsoft last couple year ? well 's couple thing -- decision made steve still ceo . like investing azure , example , decision made originally steve 's watch . ray -- guy name ray ozzie , 'm sure people know , original founder . steve started move oï¬ƒce 365. steve decided get crm online business . lot stuff -- started many year ago . think satya really step gas . said , hey , -- world moving faster thought . need get faster thought . drove better agility acceleration , think , moved cloud . able move resource . able catch . lot cloud service , n't first mover . think good job , especially something like oï¬ƒce 365 google apps cloud offering first . think really good job catching passing becoming market leader . would say , simple answer satya drive sort cultural shift term agility acceleration really focusing growth . feel like new age microsoft , completely different 's last five year ? well 're , think 's harder see sort instant change . think market perceives instant overnight change . really n't . course year . think 're better position . incentive new age , think we're better positioned . 're better positioned cloud . 're better positioned even saas , oï¬ƒce 365 offering . overall , think company better positioned growth five year ago . q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara excites next 1 two year microsoft ? well cloud business , lofty goal expectation growth cloud business . 've even exceeded . would sit room talk big could get big market could get . pretty big number . think 're sort -- thought 'd get big , n't really know big . -- far nearest tell , 's actually exceeding expectation fast market grow . think 're , , well positioned grow cloud azure . think azure 's really good couple year . 's due lot hard work lot forward thinking working directly lot customer . think cloud business far immediate opportunity u grow . longer term , work we're ai really great applicability customer . think 's early day ai . 've work ai work machine learning lot year . think key u well positioned company . see something taking , able agility move resource invest . well let 's dig little bit cloud enterprise piece . ran survey couple survey last 12 month . -- survey , enterprise reaction -- saw inï¬‚ection point azure . saw fiscal q4 result actually showed reacceleration growth . attribute reacceleration azure business ? well think 's thing . one -- guy sort remember meeting fact . remember meeting year ago said , look , really need double engineering . need get working better faster . need build service within azure . . -- made bet . bet -- think bet paid . hear customer azure service much better shape . feel much competitive . differentiation key category like hybrid . think made bet year ago starting pay . 're starting see . thing think 're candidly better selling . n't something came natural u . 're used selling on-premise product enterprise agreement environment . figure go . online product consumption environment . took u get sale force . feel like sale force figured . 're able articulate value prop better . work -- personally work closely many big deal -- customer . think 're closer customer . value prop , service better . think add faster growth . q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara conversation like largest customer ? evolved 're selling cloud azure large enterprise last , let 's say , 3 , 2 one year ago ? well -- even think 3 , two year ago , still people saying , need move cloud ? , need happen ? 're kind past point . customer talk clearly mode need move cloud , think point tam expansion , acceleration growth market market even bigger might thought . 's lot debate anymore whether move cloud . 's like move cloud . think lot fear first customer thought need move environment environment . need move on-prem cloud . think 's one thing 's caught hybrid offering we're saying , look , n't need dramatic . n't need pull everything . able offer service cloud on-prem work together , think 's probably what's resonating customer . shift last 2 three year get . get need cloud strategy . also get fact n't need one , migrate responsible reasonable way . one thing talk investor -- well , question get investor sizing opportunity iaa paas saas environment overall cloud opportunity . sound like hybrid approach expansion tam know cloud . guy view size market opportunity cloud ? yes . 's good question . resize frequently , would say . look every six month every year say , ? good news get better . think also assumption around microsoft . talk hybrid , 's assumption on-prem product sort fade away cloud grow . question always , could grow faster ... cannibalization . cannibalization . 've seen -- window server example , 've seen lot on-prem product continue grow 're also growing cloud q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroffbusiness . think reï¬‚ects success hybrid strategy , people n't want throw 've invested . lot money invested . lot hardware investment want make sure make use . look cloud let 's move stuff , let 's new stuff cloud . time , 'll get . honestly n't even know time mean , like 's window server business look like 3 , five year ? right feel good window server business . continue see decent growth . long customer happy long enable work coexist cloud environment , think 'll continue customer . microsoft 's best guess % workload public cloud today versus still -- behind firewall ? think could -- think look -- could look like , ratio next , say , five year ? yes . mean , n't know would call microsoft 's best guess . would say number 've seen -- like 10 % workload cloud . would make argument , might even optimistic . might even yet . think still lot opportunity move workload cloud . think take place next year two year like next 5 10 year . think even 10 year , 'll still -- think 'll still folk running stuff on-prem . 's going hybrid environment year come . talk large enterprise , think hybrid cloud -- hybrid approach give distinct advantage competitor market ? yes . absolutely . think 're uniquely positioned way 're vendor go say , hey , on-prem stuff 've running , continue support take care help run well cloud offering . . person need go -- company need go support microsoft . think -- lot time , people look legacy something might hold back boat anchor . n't see way . see legacy great asset customer running product . responsibility make sure cloud offering work existing product n't go nasty transition , bailing cloud . think company planet array offering . talk large customer -- moving workload cloud , demand driver shift cloud - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'harayou 're talking ? well one -- 's 2 would point , think , probably pronounced . one n't want left behind . want make sure 're current . best technology . -- 's -- 's competitive advantage . look get competitive advantage moving cloud , look say , competitor going . n't want left behind . 's one . two every conversation quickly evolves cost conversation . guy really cheaper ? still customer say , even 's cloud offering , run cheaper . get show number show benefit scale geographic footprint get goodness come along security everything else 's cloud , think understand 's different stream running low cost running low cost compliance security everything else go along . u , want competitive advantage want lower cost 're getting today . would say 2 primary driver . average , 're looking total cost ownership 's le guy , average , approximately much le total cost ownership typically ? know depends customer ? yes . really depends . would say 's almost always double digit lower could . great . let 's talk -- obviously competing cloud vendor marketplace . aws got -- ( jesse ) talking right . 're talking right . thanks , everybody , . exactly . google cloud up-and-coming vendor market . guy -- 're field , differentiate cloud offering hybrid cloud approach ? yes . think -- hybrid lead story u think continue lead story u . price always factor 're competing -- we've made public statement 're going price matcher . we're q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroffbasically saying 're going lose deal based price . think global footprint something 's hard everybody else match . data center world . anybody 's business outside u.s. , 's super important well . mentioned would match price cut . think 're better matching price cut keeping price little bit higher others market given premium service differentiate microsoft ? well think 's combination . mean , one said , hey , 're going get position price , -- see fair . somebody offering service 're offering service , n't underpriced . think microsoft always company focused share . 'll continue . think also getting much better -- earlier question , michael , seeing 's different , 're getting much better explaining innovation 're adding cloud thing offer . u , 's . 's , hey , 're going get beat price . pay ... compute . compute . pay -- 're customer microsoft price , get innovation 're investing . think , ultimately , market going go priced base innovation opposed low cost . -- came said , hey , 're going match price , save price conversation get conversation back innovation back best technology . feel like mix shift premium service versus compute offset price cut . 's ... yes . premium service growing faster core azure . 'll expect continue . mentioned earlier see legacy product asset . what's interesting durability server product last couple year . see continuing evolve ? see durability continuing server business ? - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroffwell yes . mean -- would say -- 'll continue support server product 'll continue support customer running server product long find useful long 're getting value . right 're getting lot value . -- go back hybrid story making sure on-prem product work cloud . 'll . even oï¬ƒce , using oï¬ƒce example , transition oï¬ƒce 365 online version -- 've done well . 's still lot room grow , . stuff take year year transition . think important thing customer made big investment . n't want throw investment . also want benefit cloud . expect u make work together . one question get lot investor capex spending spending building data center footprint around world support azure long could support azure . look like capex going roughly ï¬‚at year last year . investor expect large spending capex build azure last couple year done kind leveling start see improvement margin ? well would say , getting lot question cloud margin , think 12 , 18 month ago term thought cloud margin . explained time . 've candid , playing catch-up . aws head start u . azure came later . catch . catching meant build data center footprint u.s. also around globe . putting lot building investing lot server spending lot money networking . cost catching . 'm saying 're past . think much better demand signal . 've largely built global footprint . country go . 're largely built . addition , earlier comment made sat room said need really double engineering piece , think 've driven really good engineering improvement last couple year . super smart engineer working stuff . 've gone done thing core code make run eï¬ƒciently cost effectively . get server get data center . think look capex curve , -- steeper slope , playing catch . sort start ï¬‚atten , 're seeing benefit scale good engineering driving cost eï¬ƒciencies . think 'll continue see benefit engineering investment made . 'll continue see investment global expansion made . - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroffone question get investor around % utilization data center , comfortable % utilization cfo business fill ? well engineer would say measure utilization 50 different way . depends ( inaudible ) measure ? metric look ? would say -- well , 'll give cfo answer . measure cloud gross margin , right , cloud gross margin improving , getting return asset . long continue drive improvement cloud gross margin , feel like 're getting decent utilization . obviously , engineer go look . look chokepoint within data center say , 's chokepoint expand . 're counting continued good innovation engineering side drive better utilization data center . brieï¬‚y touched gross margin business . last quarter first time saw actual margin split commercial cloud , implied healthy gross margin azure , probably lot higher people believed . attribute strength ? see going time ? well think continue improve . would say think 's thing -- state obvious , 's thing impact margin . first foremost price . think price 're able achieve market , , , part goal sort neutralizing price conversation think , ultimately , 's innovation . think we'll continue see engineering benefit . even though think engineering team done great work last couple three year , 's still lot opportunity go drive good benefit . also think 's thing 're -- always put take . thing 're like building availability zone make sure customer running n't downtime , think 's investment we're willing make . might swing little bit way . would say , time , 'll continue see good improvement cloud gross margin . 'm sure cfo , look competitor ' margin business say , okay , good better ? aws , industry-leading margin right - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroffnow public cloud business . reason could n't match exceed aws margin cloud business ? yes . believe -- always said 're scale , 're inï¬‚ection point , able -- able achieve gross margin . think microsoft unique position , really , talk microsoft cloud . last quarter , reported $ 5 billion cloud revenue . 's -- 're talking oï¬ƒce 365. talking azure . talking dynamic . bing , even argue bing first cloud service . 're building data center , n't build 1 sku . n't build sort metal sku , lack better word . 're supporting diverse cloud . think 's -- 's little bit uniqueness term think spend think cloud build-out . also think put u unique position relative competitor much broader cloud offering . think time , see -- 's fair go say , margin compared others ? oï¬ƒce compared others ' asset ? dynamic compared others ' asset ? core azure compared aws ? think fair comparison . 's great . 's great segue turning oï¬ƒce 365 , commercial opportunity . oï¬ƒce 365 , 365 commercial , first time recently , eclipsed licensing oï¬ƒce 365. inning think 're ? large think 365 commercial business could next couple year ? yes . 's sort interesting -- first moved oï¬ƒce business , heard lot people saying , hey , oï¬ƒce dead , ï¬‚at , 's going done . -- course year , 've injected really good healthy growth back oï¬ƒce business . question , high ? revert back strategy , strategy use oï¬ƒce opportunity continue support customer oï¬ƒce environment also break new market . look e5 , 's helping u break new market would n't . otherwise , would n't big player . otherwise , security big piece think . bi analytics , voice , part e5 offering . -- one point time , early day , e1 sku , low-end sku predominant sku . 've said half customer running premium skus , e3 higher . look oï¬ƒce playbook keep offering skus , use oï¬ƒce strategy break new market cost-competitive way . high ? 's really dictated innovative ? 's e next look like ? e3 e5 , 's e next offering ? - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'haracan tell u e next ? n't announced anything . always -- think 's opportunity u continue build really high value-add offering customer . average different e1 , e3 e5 trended last couple year ? average pricing , average price paid per subscription subscriber . well would say , arpu trended . 's -- mix . people moving e3 people moving e5 . n't increased pricing . shifted mix higher-value skus . within e5 , -- demand driver pushing , highest price tier ? bi ? security ? security certainly top mind lot people . really good security offering e5 sku . 're really talking folk e5 , -- security big topic conversation . bi analytics , -- power bi stuff popular either free version paid version . 're well . think analytics piece super important . voice typically longer-term sell . 're -- trying get somebody replace pdf system , 's going longer conversation . think 's mix . came e5 sku , folk asking , thing tie together accrue value certain company focus one . end , get done talking , lot say , fine , let 's take e5 sku . good offering 'll use time . salesforce 's dreamforce conference . market share slide microsoft really low , dynamic bottom slide . guy thinking getting market share dynamic business ? driver ? acquisition linkedin data 's going provide ? thing guy working really pour gas fire dynamic business ? yes . think dynamic -- satya would say dynamic company biggest opportunity growth . think 's -- candidly , 's also -- , cfo's q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'haraperspective . 's biggest opportunity good , healthy gross margin . look dynamic business say , history biz apps big monolithic application people need come pay lot money pay even money get implemented . time 're done , 're year ten million dollar . 've path take tech break 's digestible 's disruptive marketplace , n't buy big monolithic apps . go buy set service set service need go buy subset service . cost-effective way . 're trying tell folk , , sort similar cloud similar hybrid story , hey , n't need throw everything 've invested . 're trying say throw european build erp . 're saying really -- great collection biz apps service broken take piece time . already made big investment erp system , go augment , surround . time , want throw go , great . 's required . think , u , real opportunity dynamic see low share 's growth , mean . 's upside . look oï¬ƒce , pretty high share . 's still upside oï¬ƒce . 's high share offering , whereas dynamic , feel like 's upside . closing oï¬ƒce , 'd remiss n't ask piracy -- pirated base oï¬ƒce . 's heavily pirated software . 365 commercial shift cloud help pirated capacity ? yes . well obviously , 's really , really hard pirate online service . 's way govern . 're building innovation online service , continuing innovate on-prem well . lot good news coming online service . want latest greatest oï¬ƒce , online offering , hard pirate . would say strategy oï¬ƒce -- first , want oï¬ƒce user . secondly , want paying oï¬ƒce user . choice use pirated version versus use competitive product , 'd probably take . time , want move oï¬ƒce 365 're ready move . lastly , oï¬ƒce margin , think keep pushing past peak margin business , oï¬ƒce business ? get scale cloud ? yes , yes . mean , feel like oï¬ƒce business pretty scaled business right . still benefit scale achieve oï¬ƒce . -- pointed earlier , half customer cloud customer . 's q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'harapretty scaled business . would say inverse sort different lens question get asked , feel oï¬ƒce pricing , really wanted drive margin oï¬ƒce , would look pricing say , something oï¬ƒce pricing . feel -- 're , , share company . feel like 's important many people using oï¬ƒce possible . 're focused maximizing price . 're focused maximizing value customer maximizing share . think there's always opportunity improve margin product , including oï¬ƒce . feel -- 'll continue see improvement oï¬ƒce margin . feel good strategy . strategy one share opposed maximizing price maximizing margin today . 's long haul . one thing keep hearing satya talk artificial intelligence . charge artificial intelligence microsoft . keep reading advance investment guy making hardware quantum computing pushing . ai fit overall strategy microsoft ? today versus couple year ago ? yes . well ai , made lot progress ai last couple year . also feel still nascent . mean , -- 's -- one thing -- 's unique cloud business , think , 're -- 'll circle around question , promise . one thing cloud business 's high -- 's expensive game . ca n't many player scale . think 're seeing . think 'll see artificial intelligence , , 's really going expensive business play . think ... mean ? well investment need make even engineering side , -- engineering side ai ... hardware side ? well software side first . start talking hardware start talking thing like quantum innovative technology , mean , really got sort stare investment say , ready ? n't many company literally afford , much le fortitude . think folk win ai one willing make big investment willing innovate , hardware software side . 're making investment q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'haraboth . 're also seeing company china leaning heavy ai . think -- think bit deep pocket race . company , point solution , great work ai . cool innovative helpful . really get scale ai , think 're going need fairly deep pocket . early , early day . asked question earlier inning oï¬ƒce . think ai , 're absolutely still first inning . cfo , 're person charge making investment . said kind stare abyss get comfortable . 's going return . much willing put , throw ai without knowing payback going next 3 , 4 , five year ? yes . 's good question . ask every day . mean , yesterday , asking question . would say focus , value customer ? try take 're building 're working get front customer soon possibly say , add value ? would -- see helping run business ? answer yes , ultimately , feel like 's monetization model . n't need know exact sku exact price sku who's going buy . need know customer going look say , hey , 's innovative , want , help . 'll figure monetization strategy . would say , short answer 'll make -- we'll continue make investment . continue market leader ai . responsible investment forward-looking lens monetization . well forward lens ? mean , guess 's question , right ? going see return one year two year , yes , probably 're going make investment . willing look 3 five year -- see monetization investment 're making ai ? yes . part org also microsoft research . -- invest considerable amount pure research every year . lot ai work , done msr . lot ai work , 's done engineering group . look something like msr , n't look monetization lens per se . say , look , 's research need stay cutting edge . 're going continue . move closer product group , move closer toward monetization model . -- really look say -- cfo , look say , something somebody would willing pay ? whether 's year road three year road , think matter . matter le . like really adding value customer . pure msr research piece q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'haralot great stuff ai product group ai 's closer customer solution ultimately , 'd end something people ( inaudible ) related ai well research , measure success investment 're making , especially 're long-term investment ? well -- go deep analysis return invested capital capex , example . 's another big bet spending , obviously , billion dollar . say really going get return . get -- go build model . think perspective , toughest part building long-term model getting sense demand . mean , really -- really nose demand curve demand look like ? ai , early day . mean , know everybody super interested . think cool . really n't know 's going work . think 's enough u keep investing people saying really work , 'll pay . 's lot investment talk collaboration tool . actually microsoft team , relatively new product competing slack , , kind upstart , kind went toe-to-toe guy publicly . view competition collaboration space right ? 's lot innovative company . think slack -- stewart curve done really good work . front lot , think collaboration communication . customer tell u , hey , use slack , 're slack shop . also use oï¬ƒce 365. n't confused . love oï¬ƒce 365 , 's communication tool . 's little bit drove u build team decide -- folk using . said , well , maybe 's opportunity work one environment . -- 's lot good innovator , think . lot interesting stuff collab . company really good stuff . ultimately , really big base oï¬ƒce customer . feel like take team oï¬ƒce , base oï¬ƒce customer , 's going give collaboration need . come bundled higher-priced tiered offering . tracking usage ? 'm sure 's still problem . q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'harayes . trending last set offering ? 's good growing . still new . yes . 's good growing growing fast . point , 's early day . great . -- 're obviously charge research division , , cutting edge microsoft working . area exciting thing 'll hear microsoft next 1 , 2 three year ? yes . 've touched -- think 've touched . think ai , see lot stuff manifested ai . lot started msr . we'll eventually segue product group . think quantum really interesting opportunity . sit lot quantum meeting . 'm still sure understand bit . people . think 're really interesting work . 'll see go . bet going pay . think need make bet . 'll start back first question , 's different microsoft ? feel like 're better identifying bet better serving get traction moving resource dollar bet . 're trying pick winner right away . 're trying invest various area . see one start win , 're better moving resource investing . microsoft always largest partner ecosystem network . product changing go-to-market changing different cloud type product , partner ecosystem changed last couple year ? see next couple year ? yes . partner ecosystem -- way -- 'm trying figure best word . way , 're hungrier , right ? know need keep paying bill every day . want innovation want q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'hara q - michael barry nemeroff - david m. o'harathat newness . partner ecosystem shown amazing propensity making big bet big investment . -- lot come u say , tell u 're working , want get front , want build new practice . partner focused taking care existing customer maybe 're innovating much investing new product much . need balance . mean , need partner ecosystem kind take care customer on-prem , cloud , wherever . feel like -- 'm big believer partner ecosystem . know lot partner , personally spend time . think partner network 's second none . 'll continue . one thing n't ask microsoft 's security strategy . important day , would characterize day microsoft ? would describe strong business growing . -- earlier question e5 , 's probably biggest demand pull think e5 . biggest demand pull think azure , securing compliance people . 's table stake . cloud service , best security . -- compliance . focus . first day , 've -- that's focus u . n't know security something microsoft always known . think 're getting known , especially cloud offering continue grow . dave , 're time . thank much joining u today . think informative . thanks , everybody , joining u today well audience . thanks , michael .
