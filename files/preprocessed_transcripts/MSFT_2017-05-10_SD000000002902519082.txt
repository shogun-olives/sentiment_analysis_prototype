's real living guide . everything always question relevant people , also make relevant organizational context u . think software , one thing come naturally , given dna , think organization first-class construct software build . sometimes 've got balance point 's organization , le people . big mistake . , right thing people time organization really seek product build . definitely think global business . operate 190-plus country . 's complicated . complicated business staying long run huge ramification term overall long-term growth , always change macro different part world . 've got adjust . footprint multinational company operates across globe , especially time like wherewithal able create local opportunity every country , 's perhaps something that's missed . go meet even head state anywhere , every head state care one thing .

's multi-device . 's even aware want perhaps complete one task going one device device . say 's going multi-device experience , next logical thing data ai 's making experience rich getting distributed . fact , see clearly today cloud people train cloud using , say , gpus , take model , deploy edge able recognize people , place , thing , using even commodity camera , example . ultimately though , want able make inference edge . want take model trained want deploy . -- want make inference edge without latency , need perhaps even train edge . clearly see -- mean , 're generating 100 gigabyte second autonomous car , chance rendezvous everything car going low . need compute data getting generated create intelligence . distribution intelligence , ai data . ultimately lead think pretty profound shift , described , inner outer loop one writes logic . start writing logic using server-less construct get triggered event . n't run one place . migrate event happening . complexity distribute computing 've introduced one statement need managed . saying 's docker container mean nothing ca n't manage complexity container think compliant application , model drift . ai model built . 's going drift 've got held accountable , inner outer loop developer computing infrastructure need support new type workﬂow . 's pretty profound shift clearly build come , like technology , mobile-first , cloud-first world evolving intelligent cloud intelligent edge world , think , definitely 're going talking year come . fantastic structural position . -- 've always -- never think server even end device operating system somehow legacy . 've got modernize . shift window window service , shift server edge cloud new news . 's something 've working towards . fact azure stack azure iot edge even window iot , think 's biggest , pressing concern iot deployment . security end node . say security , mean someone standing patch device . , runtimes cloud-managed . running edge give local intelligence big structural position . even way think multi-device app model , 'll hear tomorrow even keynote , want one device person 's life microsoft device u able fact improve thing device . 's different way think even , silicon-up , sure , 's programming model abstraction . 's cloud-down abstraction . feel world going better suited , company , well even structural position . definitely plan keep building worldview . opportunity , one thing look back , key whether seeing pc market possible u , seeing client server market , cloud market , good thing able capitalize , build good technology , build share position . one fascinating thing 's happening right front eye thought massive marketplace $ 2.5 trillion spend moving cloud , fact , limit . reason think , $ 4.5 trillion first time , going back auto example , azure getting built power back-oﬃce application back-end application client-server era . autonomous car connected car n't exist client-server era . connected elevator n't exist . precision farming precision medicine n't exist . 're suddenly becoming -- cloud getting built cog world . 's opex . cog 's digitized . 's opportunity 's front u massive digital transformation see pretty much every sector economy . 's example example go . fact , judson , come next , take couple example kind give even tenor conversation 're customer we've worked historically year pc client-server . must tell qualitative change depth conversation , suddenly powering oﬃces system erp system . 're built cog , different 's 're evolving . one thing amy spend lot time along senior leader , especially r & , think bring 3 segment think 3 ambition , 3 r & line together . quite frankly , last three year , 've seen u set marker deliver marker make continuous progress across 3 ambition . quarter , obviously even talk segment progress . real trick able make sure cost customer acquisition well lifetime value really optimized right thing across 3 ambition . otherwise , 3 thing one company ? mean , level , theory firm dictate great . , 's place 've talked much . want give view think , , connective tissue 3 thing , way , steve bill others fantastic job construction client-server era . people thought , window business server business . one business . connected one cycle . world , want . want give little bit peek . ultimately , 's people organization straight mission digital transformation . let 's take something like gaming . 's one first place brought lot asset together say , let -- . view gaming , well , microsoft xbox business . think understand console economics measured u . 's much broader thing u . took position xbox live . number subscriber -- 's biggest gaming social network , monetizes far superior gaming social network . span xbox well pc , right ? first change . mean , could say , n't ? guess , pc gaming growth market . console . attach gamers across using one social network , 's powerful . new business model , whether 's subscription -- beam acquisition , another phenomenal thing 's happening .

's pretty unique structural advantage architectural advantage . believe game changed today even everything azure iot edge azure stack . said , think fundamental way serve customer oil gas retail , automotive industry matter one hyper-scale cloud provider compete day-to-day basis today . also rich capability , whether 're ai , hope picked 2 thing . one launch cosmos db move cloud change data type data . require new database . planet-scale database support multiple data type beyond relational , think , massive breakthrough . 's big sql u . 're excited building . also 're ai . , sometimes feel 's ai capability hololens skype translate , 's fantastic . sort give u , would say , muscle build ai . 's important digital transformation perspective 's intelligent customer build . 's point parlor trick , ca n't , context digital transformation ? custom layer -- harry talked custom speech , custom vision , custom text . ability build top . customize acoustic model , computer vision need , think , going breakthrough . new database custom ai layer , feel higher layer capability power data transformation . , last point n't stress enough . ultimately , computing becomes distributed , becomes complicated . developer productivity , everything ci/cd , right , continuous integration/continuous deployment , advance 've made visual studio visual studio online , 's like saas service developer . get beyond sort zip code san francisco seattle , matter lot . want empower developer everywhere , need able give pit success find stay . 's 've always done traditionally microsoft . plan big differentiator azure cloud . 's really set think value prop 're creating people organization , 're connecting dot 3 ambition ultimately 's improving unit economics everything , whether 's cloud , whether 's saas service whether 's device bringing asset together response digital transformation opportunity . hopefully , give bit ﬂavor . think next 'll judson come talk little bit couple customer .

're incredibly proud journey 've . progress see gray line modernizing , install base , particularly consumer fundamental creating opportunity service extend beyond window . thing might think extending beyond window , particular o , would clearly thing like store , search search relationship browser . hence , investment we've made edge . much progress 've made edge see search growth . would say think really surface fundamental part move window forward . surface stood creating new category . 2-in-1 category , studio all-in-one 's beautiful , 's optimized ink creation whether 's new laptop last week , 've announcing thing pace 'm losing time horizon , one last week . say future o . think hardware , think naturally showing showcasing innovation 're making software . think 's next thing sell per user , right ? natural extension . first one people think 1 2 core term especially consumer side , consumer vision . 's course productivity , right ? think , think productivity . two year ago , really talking transition new subscription model get would get ? answer 're . feel really proud actually getting $ 26.2 million -- 26.2 million person subscriber base . think , 's another networked asset , right , take advantage oﬃce graph add value oﬃce graph . think point , even think growth curve , 're thinking consumer , think happening even overall consumer pc decline . really mean attach quite well . 're continuing see subscriber , we're seeing good renewal rate . actually feel really good value we've added business . course , relevance across multiple end point even beyond window . next talk next fundamental part productivity , really investment 've made linkedin member side . think linkedin 2 fundamentally different thing , right ? member value . business solution value . 'll separate purpose . really saying 500 million member . announced last monday well . really , think health vibrancy network , 's total number , 's whether session engagement growing . see session actually outgrowing membership . engagement 's getting better . 're adding value . team incredibly focused adding value member . member growth important , 's really engagement add . think slide satya showed show oﬃce 365 graph sort linkedin data node well -- combine node mind , see potential even add network valued asset 2 endpoint covered . final one . kind 2 core , think , 're uniquely good come thing satya talked . really think competency . second one , competency bringing networked active user base together gaming . look graph , think top total growth kind expect overall xbox mau . what's interesting , really , curve acceleration 've -- two year ago . nothing beyond console , nothing . 're already 25 % xbox user base , really using xbox engaging beyond console . endpoint phil talked . frankly , extension thought importance mixed reality business , think , number , obviously , think go 40 % think real question get perfect overlap one play single endpoint ultimately think extension value networked asset . really see confidence ability land broader strategy . people know , already $ 110 billion market , console , game service relate . growing really double digit . think u , 've got multibillion business 's profitable growing profitably . foundation lay add new business model , whether phil mention , ad , subscription , selling gaming direction , whether 's ability think arpu addition low-value watcher , whether 's video model asset like beam . think really open possibility market far beyond $ 100 billion 're already able compete effectively . let pivot model org , adding value organization . course , 're going go right back window per user value , right ? start selling user value . 'll extend department ultimately app development . first one , satya talked , secure productive enterprise . world secure productive enterprise , generally , one , think running window 10 modern state , taking advantage security management , maybe using unique hardware asset instantiation 's possible . example , surface hub large screen device , right ? 's natural ability u create category creates productive workplace . think , course , oﬃce , right , oﬃce 365. 's secure productive enterprise asset . think modern tool used deployed together secure manageable consistent environment . shortcut call secure productive enterprise . first component , obviously , window . think window , 've combined 2 thing think similar , right ? 's sort 's oem pro business , right , selling commercial device selling device commercial business . whether want buy surface certain group user entirety , whether work better mobile versus , 's really building , , showcase device extend building . 've done good job seeing pull window 10 , 've talked . 've seen growth market . continue see good endpoint demand window 10. think oems seen term confidence building machine advance continue feel pretty strong global , actually , environment commercial side . top , 've also added added new kpi year . 'm sure everybody still understands . thought would take opportunity explain bit . 's window commercial product cloud service revenue . really mean part window value sold enterprise look far annuity like . 's sold traditionally ea , concept adding multiyear value . tends give certain upgrade right . -- important thing resonated far customer thing like advanced threat detection tool we've launched -- shortcut customer often refer atp . value 're seeing big transition used even nonannuity business u consistent double-digit annuity grower people see value put security management product . 's , would argue , compelling price point compared many vendor compete often space . next , 're back oﬃce . think two year ago , showed exact graphic . said felt growing install base moving install base .
