'd love start taking step back . lot evolved last year industry level within -- cloud space within google cloud . give u world view sit cloud adoption , usage , see google cloud 's position within framework ? yes . great question . thank , eric . look last three year , cloud adoption changed variety way . people looking -- three year ago , talk large customer , would say , cybersecurity probably place would use cloud . data , 'm sure , would use cloud . 're seeing major trend new segment product line , opportunity opening u . many customer use u along cloud . multi-cloud , almost , everybody look , open huge market u . third , speed project getting done increasingly many company adopting cloud-first rather cloud-also approach . we've invested heavily product ecosystem bring solution customer . seeing significant interest partner , want build solution top cloud take market . morning example , announced variety different partnership data area , example thing thing 're seeing increasingly getting traction . okay . given macro environment remains uncertain , n't experienced prolonged recession downturn , since cloud computing scaled industry aside went covid , think potential outcome public cloud spend resiliency within broader enterprise ap budget potential landscape ? 'm going comment macro . think audience people far sophisticated macro environment change . long- term trend driving cloud adoption continue play extraordinary role macro environment , right ? instance , much cloud computing provides cost-effective infrastructure rather traditional model operation . offer example , managed service , managed database , managed data warehouse , managed analytic tool . give people ability shift people managing machine project . also allows q - eric sheridan - thomas kurian q - eric sheridanorganizations maybe people constrained actually get project done 're thing like managing machine device . third thing , lot capability offer could n't get form fashion . example , help lot organization managing demand forecasting , supply chain visibility 's predictive capability machine learning tool let . 's we're offering substitute something people could get way . 's offering new capability really important . factor long-term , 're always investing managing long-term . think play well long-term direction see adoption technology . sticking long-term direction minute , maybe bring back investment . laid lot long-term opportunity . organization think aligning capital investment opportunity see ? feedback thinking long-term profitability earning return investment ? good question . make -- look investment primarily three area , different time horizon . capital investment data center , global network , machine , et cetera , typically looking long-term horizon , typically order 8 10 year , investing building large-scale region country something 're response large addressable market typically 're making investment 8 10 year horizon . second , go-to-market organization . early build go-to-market organization , n't lot customer , right , started . funding go-to-market organization acquire customer . 've seen strong adoption technology customer , number sale people working existing revenue generating client , opposed working greenfield account , change eﬃciency salesforce . 's second piece . product , 've matured product last three year , become real player investment make adding product adding feature product always response either customer segment , opening new addressable market like compliance need . , even 've matured product portfolio , 're building incremental capability , baseline lift u lot point view investment eﬃciency . 're confident , obviously , work closely leadership team . 're proud , would n't investing , n't absolute clarity ruth , sundar rest leadership team path profitability . - thomas kurian q - eric sheridan - thomas kuriangreat . understood . recently announced first region mexico . think infrastructure footprint scaling time ? much driven growth see ahead versus need localization ? much localization driven regulatory pressure around thing like data like data privacy performance end user ? lot decision investment cloud region also based -- invest cloud region , 're looking multiple factor . one total addressable market local market . second demand multinational company want serve local market large number global company customer base many say , consider market , tell u example market would really like present technology consideration , example , latency . , regulatory consideration , example , government may prefer strongly require data remains within boundary country . , depending parameter , make decision , decision also guided investment go-to-market function , build cloud region , also know monetize . sticking theme go-to-market talked little bit earlier sale force , productivity scaling sale force , google cloud spent lot time optimizing go-to-market strategy aligning organization broader vision since took leadership . talk look like today ? manage manage think sale force productivity utilizing partner go-to-market versus maybe go-to-market 's owned organically ? 've , disciplined , focused growth strategy go-to-market organization . 're taking consumer company building real enterprise business , almost one else . ? start focusing certain country market , every year , 've added incrementally , wanted get first depth certain country market rather spread wide . 's step one . second 've specialized , specialized three different way . specialized product category , example , look 's buying cybersecurity tool , buyer typically chief information security oﬃcer , necessarily cio . look people buying analytics data platform , sometimes , 's department , many case , example , case study done wall street journal work ups actually head logistics . , second thing specialized salesforce . 've also specialized industry . recently example , announced creation public sector subsidiary , focused selling government agency . , specialize q - eric sheridan - thomas kurian q - eric sheridanindustry different industry unique need . lastly , sell traditional technology , traditional organization enterprise , well company born cloud . people call digital native . way engage different . 've done work . we've built focus team focused partner , partner complement u , help u accelerate growth , help deploy solution . 've super clear play partner play , 've great success growing ecosystem partner around u . frankly , many partner find u one easy company work 've grown substantial business u . great . okay . google long seen differentiated product , think data analytics , ai , machine learning . see demand type product evolving ? see primary driver growth part market ? important thing see got data , said 's lot individual piece technology people talk , talk data lake , talk data warehouse , talk lake house , talk ml tool . look average company , want platform load data run different kind analysis . people data scientist say , want build model . people business analyst n't expertise write model , want query data . people want run calculation different kind programming language . first thing built one data cloud supporting different ﬂavors . second thing said , really want data , 've got across cloud , nobody want say data happens cloud , therefore , run analysis . , bridge cloud . vast , vast majority customer using multiple cloud . third thing see introduced capability organization share data people . super interesting retailer consumer packaged good company example , sharing demand forecast fulfillment supply chain , really transforming eﬃciently supply chain run collaborate across boundary organization . shifted data topic organization focus . , head merchandising , head supply chain , head logistics , 've trained people sell . okay . talked little bit presentation mandiant acquisition . wanted turn security minute . talk focus within organization security ? think differentiates google cloud ? maybe give u example risk threat , think organization facing , bring back explanation mandiant write acquisition guy ? - thomas kurian q - eric sheridan - thomas kurian look security portfolio -- two simple lens . first , running workload company cloud , ensure safe ? simplifying security people . today people run system breach happening , 's invested tool fact many tool , n't understand administer environment securely . 've done really provide people three capability . one simplifying architecturally run workload cloud . second , providing ability measure 're running assured configuration , call short workload , take responsibility jointly assure security . third proof manage measure security posture , able ensure . , also offer cyber insurance insurance company customer customer say , 'm running google , 'm secure . 's proof reinsure . 's one piece . second piece , variety ﬂavor cyber threat continues accelerate . important factor 're cyber attacker long first time i'm detected till last company affected locking . window long time today , keep finding new way come . rationale behind mandiant super simple . get world 's best incident response team ? forefront almost every attack detect new ﬂavors vulnerability coming , new ﬂavor attack coming . give u best threat intelligence feed world earliest response capability . fed platform 're combining , obviously , google strength machine learning ai detect needle haystack , , compromised integrate workﬂow allows remediate . importantly , ask average thistle , guarantee 've actually ejected attacker know 're longer compromised , almost nobody tell . last piece validating 're fact secure . , believe fundamentally take cybersecurity lot little bolt-on product secure platform people use guarantee enterprise-wide security posture . got . want come back workspace , think resonates resonates everyone personal professional life , touch element google workspace application suite . hearing client future hybrid work ? role workspace may play workﬂows ? positioning google cloud 're hearing customer ? q - eric sheridan - thomas kurianwhen hybrid work happened , lot organization . medium company moving recording studio , people issuing device mobile workforce . example , pilot airline , nursing staff , hotel company sudden guest needed access , different permission , biggest thing saw enormously interesting , hybrid work mean work anywhere . hybrid , work mean want access anywhere . mean need work securely anywhere , need tool platform 's super easy use . platform everybody world comfortable using , platform 's super easy provision , platform 's super easy administer . cost , particularly see asia , example , 's large , large professional workforce , almost use mobile primary platform n't use laptop desktop much . 've got large , large client , hundred thousand employee overnight needed provisioned given access system , platform make trivial . okay . know 're coming time want squeeze one , want take opportunity ask secular growth long-term . obviously talked lot enterprise smb customer . maybe leave u perspective people shifting workload public cloud bring back see google cloud specifically positioned landscape ? long-term , technology shift always driven business priority . business priority digitization . every company talked say , learned pandemic 'm taking forward , drive digital customer interface , 'm bank , people going come branch , reach customer online offer capability . , long-term trend basically driven . small medium enterprise fall two different ﬂavors . -- 're technology company . , want end-user shrink wrap product . offer . , digital company , startup called , 're basically technology company want u give technology power google service , want use offer cloud . large enterprise obviously ecosystem play need organization , typically , system integrator . sometimes , 've outsourced managed service provider work . bringing ecosystem along helped u also get large enterprise base , 've focused last three year . obviously , 're pleased result 've shown demonstrated , remain confident future real player cloud computing . q - eric sheridan great . well , first , thomas , thank making available . really enjoyed conversation . second , please join thanking thomas kurian google cloud part conference year .
