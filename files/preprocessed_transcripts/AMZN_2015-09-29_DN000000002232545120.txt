's kind technology 's emanating lot software service vendor 's included particular retailer 's sale strategy future poonam goyalmarketing area . , lookout company across ecosystem way data mining visualization , 's becoming increasingly important . segmentation one , part something seema brought gnc sending email every customer . used happen previously , -- customer divided whether male female age group , let 's say plus minus five year . 're male 20 25 , certain habit people would market particular category , market certain product . analytics , big data , 're able segregate two people let's say two 25 year old male , -- could 'm sure separate habit , could target product differently , become really important space ; poonam said , company , would disadvantage going forward . moving next topic 'd say , 'm sure everyone , anyone follows retail industry software industry , interested area , 's area security . last year , seen acceleration cyber attack [ ph ] across ecosystem , retail vertical probably largely lot credit card data , becomes extremely important something like leak , impact retailer 's reputation sale . 's area increased spending software spend , software vertical , want get opinion poonam seema 're seeing respective company -- kind scare point . thanks , anurag . guess 'll start recent data breach actually large impact retailer , target 's data breach 2013 remember , christmas holiday season , could n't come great time target . think heard breach , lot u thought , 's okay target get pas , stock really n't move much , order investor much concern , think saw happened shortly data breach target cut earnings sale guidance store left empty . breach cost target , think counting still going $ 250 million plus includes insurance proceeds , strip 's $ 160 million , that's still lot money , money cost target , left shopper astray , mean shopper forced go somewhere else concerned data breached . seema shah chen grazutisand saw similar example , long ago retailer even market also privy data breach . n't impact 's sale much , n't occur peak holiday season . retailer investing cyber security , target set center actually monitor 's happening cloud space make sure least alerted another measure happen another breach upcoming could probably detect faster cautioned . saw similar example outside apparel space . think seema one share n't much impact , also recent data breach . thanks , poonam . hardline space , 's couple breach , one sally beauty holding , 've actually breached twice , march 2014 , may 2015. think second breach caused malware deployed point sale system . sale weak last year , combination company-specific issue possibly lingering effect customer wary visiting store credit card data breached risk someone find information . home depot , much larger breach september , august-september 2014. think slight woe image , really negative -- impact sale much . home depot quickly address problem though forthcoming happened 've done improve security . unlike target breach , breach home depot , guess , peak selling time also much impact sale might home depot 's also helped secular trend favor unlike recovery housing market thing like . 's le susceptible . many alternative also consumer space , perhaps . overall , would say breach forced retailer really consider data security , risk breach really risk public image target 's case , risk sale . 'm going try go entire segment without mentioning ashley madison , 's really hard . . seriously though , go back armour apps , yesterday mentioned interaction app going . give example , talk health tracking apps , opportunity connect health insurance company like wellness management provider get level interaction company using mobile app . anurag rana poonam goyalit 's one thing credit card stored actually cancel , get different level hacker get access actual health data . 'm guessing get interaction app , even company significantly increase investment cyber security , 're dealing sensitive data , much credit card number . security software vendor actually extremely well last 12 18 month driven lot breach across almost vertical . what's happening also right lot emerging technology , upcoming technology helping retailer prevent breach future one important one right tokenization end-to-end encryption . lot retailer would , following apple 's lead apple pay example , swipe credit card terminal , happen , -- card , number would converted particular token 's token 's going go across network even someone tap token , wo n't technology unlock make thing lot secure . -- retailer also increasingly using security service monitoring advanced threat lot vendor providing service right . happened , advanced threat detected traditional signature base , technology becoming increasingly pervasive space attack never happened particular malware brand new . kind thing -- easily detected legacy firewall technology bunch company offering software service , security service offering area help secure thing little bit better . also seeing increased security software spending virtual device , lot virtualization data center sometimes secure physical hardware machine , lot focus coming well . 're going , 're going reach look q & received audience . one one interesting u , defensive strategy work brick-and-mortar retailer compared world move towards e-commerce . ask poonam . poonam , insight question , poonam ? yeah . think , 're seeing right basically -- asked question , 's happening seeing , 's really integration technology think . hello , hear ? anurag rana poonam goyal seema shah chen grazutis seema shah chen grazutis yes . hello ? hello , hear . jump think lot defensive mechanism retailer actually increase experience , shopper 's experience within store . creative part put lot investment store look , kind experience give shopper come , way shop actually -- merchant presented . think company advantage company actually story tell . look retailer , give example , like ralph lauren like north face , brand kind story tell niche , let 's see , talk north face , 's outdoor retailer , people interested kind activity go store . still value add go actually look merchandise kind see speak customer representative . store give different experience go online go amazon . seema , wanted add something ? yeah , would say , also think 's opportunity retailer focus customer service sale associate knowledgeable . 're looking paint go home depot talk someone knowledgeable area , different brand , see look technology , tablet lowe 's , look home , differentiate experience mean n't go online pick different blue amazon , want go store . would say , lastly , store important people still return item fact pay shipping return item , also may drive consumer certain retailer others . poonam goyal chen grazutisi think also instead fighting e-commerce threat , think lot u embrace , would give example shoe store -- personally many time encourage problem , go look certain pair shoe find pair shoe love , unfortunately n't size . embrace e-commerce part sale rep ipad front , ordering shoe size need tell 're going tomorrow night . think 's powerful actually , increase conversion . get amount people come store , 10 % people went could n't find size , could n't find color . enable sale rep give -- empower kind transaction using technology using e-commerce capability company , think part defense play , best defense offense , 's opinion . anyone ? agree chen , 'm sorry earlier . basically saying , way defensive actually go head head compete online retailer 's retailer investing technology infrastructure go ahead let go share giving e-commerce try win back . investment e-commerce huge way get back share addition personalization service 've heard , customization unique offer . offer everyone else offering . differentiate that's really way win customer back also offer value . think 're competing mid-market offer staple item , 's going really back customer unless offer price experience 've seen retailer shift either one spectrum , either win price offer best price offer best experience get get customer back door . thanks , poonam . another question ; say , track retailer technology trend terminal ? would say couple thing ; one would , lot dashboard vertical technology retail address lot thing piece . second , lot service software company breakdown revenue different vertical .
