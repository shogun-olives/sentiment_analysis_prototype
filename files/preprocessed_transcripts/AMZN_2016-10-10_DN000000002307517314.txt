's backed 300 plus third-party data provider delivered buy sell recommendation . analyst team average 20 plus year buy- sell-side research experience . bi exclusively provided client subscribe bloomberg professional service accessed bi go . without ado , 'll hand mickey robert presentation , followed question . mickey ? thanks , mandeep ; hello , everyone . thanks joining u today . , today want talk cloud see everything going . robert work together help bring information client idc . , first thing 'd like understand , see cloud part call third platform , 's also tied mobility , social side business data analytics . think important part understand , cloud new baseline need actually bring change going overall perspective . look cover area enterprise application , find , know , operating model really shifted on-premises license maintenance support cloud subscription standpoint . robert mahowaldsee , expect trend continue , also see reason going need cloud 're going , 's changing well . really see information come data set information 's external world , iot , internet thing , artificial intelligence , cognitive , 's whole host thing , 're driving ability cloud even past . talk , 'd like think cloud baseline get next step 're going see lot change 's already occurred , 're going see continuing path even quicker pace we've seen already . robert , 'm going move next slide . yes . mickey said , cloud -- definitely -- product operationalized sold cloud service definitely fast grower software . , look , know , worldwide software market 2015 , growth 4.75 % . think growth , know , maintenance plus subscription -- plus license next five year expected cagr little bit , little 5.25 % , largely driven staying power among ability sap oracle others keep company maintenance enterprise user license agreement . 's kind 's sort driving high-end software . remainder saas service cloud service . anything software operationalized delivered service , call cloud software broadly . depending capability market 's sold , growth rate next five year anywhere 90 % [ ph ] 85 % , , really significant . would say low-end slow growth area like -- maybe financial planning manufacturing apps , high-end data management analytics suiting fast grower . slide use characterize cloud economy . way -- way vendor , anybody want interact cloud economy make money . left side kind know think , core cloud service . 've built something , 've serviced operationalized , part cost good sold . 'm selling all-in subscription cloud service , many , many form metered gigabit minute even second . case 's [ ph ] like aws lambda , way software , application software say , really customer look -- feel much , look lot like packaged software , , way paid , 's ( technical diﬃculty ) 're paying perhaps year upfront , might paying might paying year time . nothing like -- quite like granular metered service think think cloud broadly . application provider really sort engineered system work . would say , also becomes true 're talking company like sap oracle , using thing like subscription credit place payment customer who've got residual maintenance due contract company want switch saas version whatever software . maybe 's e- business suite want maintain kind fixed schedule . benefit , know , buyer seller degree equally , provides lot predictability buyer . , 's cloud service left side thing think think cloud service . cloud component middle slide call arm dealer equation . 's looking market ( inaudible ) -- familiar idc black book , 's clearly everything cover across information technology communication world , thinking product made work well cloud ( technical diﬃculty ) . , whether 're open tenancy , know , whether 're hosted , know , whether 're designed grid compute ( inaudible ) , service management product , example , 're really , really important multi- cloud world . ability tap ( technical diﬃculty ) heterogeneous asset thing like cmdb ( technical diﬃculty ) change management governance asset live different place ? , idc looking world hardware , software service sold enterprise build enterprise private cloud service provider isvs type , saying , know , ? something functionally different product , matter sort market structure vendor say make right , customer buying intention deploying would call cloud , perhaps private cloud enterprise got , know , virtualization automation scripting , et cetera . -- 's think private cloud product used way . 's huge -- 's huge market , would say sort little bit different cloud service market , 're going lift shift , 're going lot customer saying , know , want move something 's much . 's lot lift well 've got different category software brought together one provider sold service customer customer getting probably would gotten otherwise bought piece separately , course 're paying , 's -- lift . cloud component world , 's really kind pie 's slowly turning one slice two slice , and/or probably staying kind big two-slice world long time 've got set component serving traditional , would call first second platform business part business . we've got sold cloud delivery , know , cloud instantiation . 's middle segment cloud economy slide . right , 've got management professional service , everything network consulting , business consulting , system integration , like [ ph ] across board , domain-based technology-based . , everything , need either get customer road cloud , 're isv , example , 're big si help customer continue use optimize consumption public virtual hosted private cloud service . , example , lot -- know , 's lot day one , would call , day one system integration stuff done get company figure , rationalize portfolio , figure provides value company , continues provide value based utilization , provides value run locally might -- n't provide value run locally , might still provide value ran place also , ran provider . going equation , kind day one road cloud stuff really -- space , also greater extent , especially global si figured real opportunity helping customer ongoing integration optimization consumption cloud service . we're moving world even infrastructure level , guess probably predominantly mostly infrastructure level , somewhere middle tier well , 's -- 're going able operational arbitrage around cost function -- among provider . enough provider basic core capability coming market handful engine coming making arbitrage possible , kind stuff , arbitrage optimization heavily leveraged big si , helping mid-size large company figure use cloud consume thing well work well . call maturing cloud service , 've around , becoming well- understood people kind get make money . would say emerging side , industry cloud service , industry cloud topic idc covering two year . 're putting lot time effort -- year . 'd brieﬂy say 's -- 's centered around real center gravity player industry . look name , 'll see company either early certain niche mickey north rizzamarkets else 're industry leader market whether 's , know , pharma , manufacturing , automotive , raw material , know , biotech , et cetera . notion -- , industry cloud place would platform-as-a-service , everything hosting data , analytics transaction , 's also place provide industry- specific regulatory compliance , governance , even case like aws govcloud , indemnification . , essentially assurance behind saying , ensure limit sla , -- sued found default , made open damaging audit technical asset 're providing . , 's really , typically get provider cloud service even professional managed service degree . industry cloud something think really big deal . 'd say second big aspect industry cloud , 've spent much time , platform company built customer others , even industry peer well , able build new custom code , durable code sold , consumed . also becoming marketplace like-minded company -- understand important thing technology 's kind table stake . important thing compliance unique set software asset access , know work alongside -- , know , core product using , 's kind way industry cloud take u . next slide , please . okay , mickey ? , slide -- yes , slide , 're looking number acquisition cloud software . , look overall perspective , see grown rapidly . something consider cloud acquisition two three one depending upon area 're looking on- premise software . think robert great job describing earlier market look like company going cloud . , know , look look top company cloud 2016 salesforce , eight , nine acquisition krux yesterday , announcement data management side . 'll also see oracle seven , accenture google six , microsoft six , cisco five , ibm five , amazon four , apple four . , know , pick , know , top 20 . really look , 're seeing look trend , 's awful lot cloud purchase , see lot ai , data set , anything digital robert mahowaldtransformation world 's taking beyond third platform , they've got cloud basic adding cloud infrastructure , , 're getting next standpoint say information piece need platform piece need round offering . think , know , robert great job last slide talking cloud service whole emerging area coming . think somebody like ford microsoft , invested pivotal . basically , know , pivotal connected driver organization 're bringing automation aspect represent cloud well . 're starting see company come together may thought past really make difference end product 're selling bring consumer market overall aspect . , quick snapshot , acquisition cloud becoming greater greater see chart . let 's see . next slide , robert ? okay , great . might hard see , meant build slide , essentially -- notion talk reason company acquire acquire . clearly , experience looking software broadly , acquirees sort focused mix traditional packaged software saas/cloud service . would say last couple year particularly -- drive simply desire buy capability , net new capability . 're buying non-cloud capability understand software work well , get cheaper , multiple going far le fully operationalized cloud service run rate subscriber wing . , know , cost -- cost capability pretty much key driver decides -- kind company buy , know , business relationship , partnership , lot thing , really 's . would note last two year , think data bear . desire buy company call cloud shop much stronger . think sense urgency come especially larger vendor like oracle microsoft , ibm sap particularly understand really opportunity big way , think -- sort left side -- chart previously . want complete cloud company , mean , 've got operationalize set service . 've got consumer hardware software , 've got sort orient professional service operation , 've got full range developer service , application service , self-service infrastructure service , network compute storage . , need -- 'm going necessarily lot differentiator , need get level ability compete total cloud level , , know , idc belief great sense urgency customer , also vendor say also customer rationalize portfolio move lot stuff cloud property quickly possible . certainly , 've seen amazon desire -- cut price thing like amazon snowball , three time last 18 month trying get customer massive volume data cloud . 've also made free many case data streaming product , move certain amount data , know , given day cloud operational analysis long-term storage . , desire get customer move , 's lot urgency right . think desire buy acquire software capability able total cloud strong , think 's going point , know , depending big customer feel strategic safety around focusing ( inaudible ) one vendor risk sure . opportunity get spend pie , think larger , , one , get customer navigate transition cloud , say customer , say , core sap application , take care . , also get customer start building platform , putting data platform , start using adjacent partner application platform , find 's tremendous amount gravity around customer activity platform buying right kind capability becomes much important . , say key message , know , 's round functional portfolio run business cloud app . thing really important customer make sure need ideally build something , know , functional parity customer ' experience packaged application that's often , diﬃcult . two , figure need complete set workﬂows important customer . sell one thing , say , know , say , know , talent management , need thing like review management , social sourcing new capability , piece , -- 's kind small point piece see really bought important right . normalize balance sheet also super important , report oracle's quarter -- last quarter 80 % growth saas portfolio , organic growth around fusion portfolio really 40 % . , know , really le half growth , even , consider pipeline . mickey north rizza robert mahowaldand message , oracle figured , know , early needed -- need taleo eloqua rightnow , company 've bought substantial customer stream help normalize balance sheet make big transition allows put good face otherwise poor quarter hardware lost 12 % software license , think 0.5 % par maintenance 9 % . , allows lead saas normalize balance sheet folk . would say , know , point slide written , slide little year old . -- 45 plus saas pure-plays 25 million -- 're potential target . would say level & mickey went track time , number actually quite bit . 's probably , know , track idc , know , product call cloudshare . track 2,400 as-a-service vendor around world . 400 made little $ 20 million 2015. big saas property , independent saas property exception workday couple others snapped heretofore . , think , , 's sort -- next wave & going much market would call long tail saas , 're going talk minute , investigating , know , 's functional capability , geography , know , management team , partner , et cetera , kicking tire really looking company bought lower multiple big name yet , sure . mickey , want take slide want -- nope , go ahead . roll , moved could see long tail start focusing , really talked market . sure , yes , absolutely . , know , typically software market , find , know , competitor one , two three pecking order another , right ? depending mature market , know , 20 % 60 % . think 're looking another 40 % . 's -- 's market lot variability . 've got mature segment cloud software immature segment cloud software make lot sense . cloud software idc software-as-a-service , -- includes application system infrastructure software , thing like storage software , archiving service management , security , et cetera , 's part saas . see -- kind look middle slide , applications-as- a-service , si service also included cloud software idc platform-as- a-service , platform-as-a-service piece . see growth time particular see importance key incumbent vendor . , know , -- key set incumbent vendor . think could probably take picture little bit exception quickbase , 're pretty much financial management application space , 're , know , 're ( technical diﬃculty ) sale consumer . think everybody else think rush urgency sudden serve different kind functional piece customer ' technical capability need . , know , company like salesforce , course , even point , microsoft , course , application big , oracle , application huge thing past 10 year . pushing market like oracle , know , operationalizing enterprise business suite , itsm set product . cloud business suite , 's something allows customer ( technical diﬃculty ) multi-cloud resource management governance , 's really big . obviously , know , java developer cloud , building fully ﬂedged announced last openworld , fully ﬂedged infrastructure-as-a- service customer take granular bite self-service basis computing storage set product . kind stuff -- kind -- desire show slide show time , really ﬂushes diversity big player , desire think go forward time take -- get kind functional diversity . look long tail defined change , , know , lot work , modeling work around many isvs world . , isv defined -- case , 's cloud isv , right ? 25,000 isvs , know , broadly , -- probably 5,500 as-a-service isv . make money , money delivering fully operationalized subscription service customer . look entry market , mean , really long tail new -- new start-up . 's also , sure , company , know , maybe , stuck & space maybe third platform space , 're really serving industry-specific customer , particularly , know , say , maybe point sale software , n't really needed kind as- a- service revenue . -- know , , 're going talk mean next slide , 's big deal , right , . look stats , mean read well , enter life market enablers , know , whole set start-up company 've glommed university , glommed onto big isvs , middleware database provider , n't good idea , say , know , want grow business want saas business . know 's cheap way get access infrastructure . 's really -- lot work figuring small business get started ? kind business functionally ? 's big driving demand ? get tool asset need start business , many case , know , ibm oracle microsoft , even amazon , 's , know , give tool create grow business , get run rate 's profit- sharing kind model , get bigger thing change . look splitting , big & sort middle company start get . understand business . 've got customer , 've reached certain run rate 're looking around diﬃculty growing next level . 's start either entertain offer , start conversation , may start core partnership big database middleware distribution vendor , 's kind think next wave & going come . 's lot -- big company really 've got clear intention 're . 'm buying marquee name got set customer hopefully completely , know , replicative 've selling long time , provide functionality , know , need time -- need speed market , ca n't really hope build right . , 've got lot work around long tail software . -- entire software universe change time net new smaller company coming different degree hybrid , hybrid 're talking specifically kind revenue company make , diverse revenue stream , 'll happy talk bloomberg share . next slide . slide lot work update time . think key thing understand ( technical diﬃculty ) build , look cloud software revenue broadly , vendor 90 % cloud , pretty large growth trajectory . piece portfolio delivered as-a-service , right ? vendor ( technical diﬃculty ) see -- see little bit lower , right ? , know , could company list company may make small amount revenue delivering cloud service . remind people time , company even substantial as-a-service revenue like microsoft , example , still probably make le 7 % total revenue delivering cloud service . 's way . think represents relatively slow nature change industry . think software market mickey look , even 2020 , see getting 22 % , 23 % revenue coming buying subscription service , rest various , call , first second platform service . huge installed base slow churn slow convinced need requirement , necessity value making transition , , 's . look packaged software revenue vendor , mentioned , cagr seven-year period , 's 5.5 % . interesting important thing understand -- company n't as- a-service revenue stream . , know , company idc track broadly software tracker little 5,000 company . work understand think share pie , growth pie ? n't as-a-service revenue project 2020 , 's le 1 % . , -- basically growth pie , , 's different every , know , functional market 're , whether 's , know , database 's hosting 's , know , erp , , whatever growth market , average , company n't make money as-a-service delivery le 1 % -- shot le 1 % growth time . , share lot vendor client , 's important understand , know , either strong compelling reason we're going go customer want move cloud thing like update , know , single set capability time internal customer et cetera . also mean also significant benefit provider . , know , significant telling company like oracle moving , know , working , hard moving higher higher gross margin as- a- service portfolio , company look around 40 % , oracle around 65 % , goal move toward 80 % gross margin as-a- service offering . company figured operationalize service get eﬃcient deliver , deliver , understood , one , coming like fast train ; two , need get shop understand work world ; three , chance take growth greatly diminished n't hard work , whether 's merger whether 's , know , building set service walking customer hard step get . mandeep singh robert mahowaldboards understand , c-suite understands ( technical diﬃculty ) understand . , think -- vendor customer n't understand message . yes , 's great . thought fascinating conversation know whole aspect long tail cloud , think , help put thing perspective way thing going cloud . mean , recall correctly whole thing started private equity took -- right , bought cvent marketo , vista equity partner bought two company back early year . idea clear point time , know , way & wave going making acquisition company n't huge cash ﬂow -- & really picked saw mega deal year . microsoft bought -- buying linkedin , salesforce buying demandware oracle buying netsuite . , -- 'm curious driving deal optimism year , like , seen much bigger deal year seen cloud far . -- guy like kind note around reason around seeing bigger deal year ? yes , let -- 'll give answer mickey , 'm sure , got good thought . , yes , know , would say last opportunity snap big successful saas property , matter multiple take set competition . think , know , long time oracle , know , used -- larry ellison used stage openworld make fun salesforce , n't think anybody making fun salesforce anymore . figured diversify product set sell pretty much part organization , sale suite . think -- 's driven fear -- think fear somebody else simply step buy n't . know , example , oracle bought netsuite , several bidder sort drop . think netsuite seen company successfully managed , know , worth spending , know , 3.5 billion whatever spent netsuite , know , got netsuite shareholder set big established customer gaga netsuite . netsuite , way , figured bring partner , know , like financialforce namely brought piece pie functionally could n't bring . think instilled fear heart big apps provider think drive pressure acquire somebody big spend lot money point . n't know , n't really think workday , n't know anybody really big , real valuable property core enterprise application space mickey north rizza mandeep singh mickey north rizza mandeep singh mickey north rizzacommand . would say , course , salesforce , think salesforce , maybe reached point stratosphere outright buy would pretty darn diﬃcult , think merger likely . yes . great . yes . would agree well . 'd add one caveat . think much 're buying next big thing trying beat competition , also think trying add two thing . one , customer side second product side , 're trying use myriad bring innovation marketplace keep grabbing market share . , really think 's shift pure operational aspect bringing information better job capitalizing quicker . know , think marketplace , rate change based technology right 's software package type industry general huge 's much significant last 20 , 30 , let 's say , 40 year . great . topic since said company , larger guy looking acquire market share , know , basically like buying smaller cloud guy . area enterprise software think right consolidation point ? maybe , talk specifically specific segment , know , see need consolidation ? think finance one area . 's still awful lot on-prem finance cloud provider . hcm really taken , procurement one that's taken lot consolidation go 's probably behind time area need point time , enterprise asset management , 're going see continue , already gone quite bit , order management , guess crm hot topic obviously everything salesforce . robert , thought , supply chain would want ? robert mahowald yes . would say , know , obviously , 've got -- 've got great slide , wish add . 've got , call , functional market , atomic size market . , example , know , treasury risk inside financial management , inside erp , inside application . , granular level , definitely niche player provide piece portfolio -- slightly bigger company like infor , example , would -- epicor would love able bring table customer , able afford build , n't enough customer space . think thought couple three year ago , well , approached space partnership . customer ask , say example , board operation n't board operation saas service , lot little player , pick partner among . think 's seeing gradually le interesting mid-size large organization enterprise application integration stitch together various provider set slas maybe set data integration process integration . think 're willing say know ? much partnership okay get capability need , would really like see capability come one dashboard one place . , make tactical integration something along line . think message 're hearing , buy somebody else build capability , one place . think even mid-size provider , saas provider erp broadly starting say , need think buying capability n't know -- understand , lo behold , started really small saas provider 've grown size 've got complex mid- sized large customer , 've got complex need need acquire capability . niche area functional market level really big . would say , last piece , would talk -- industry application , company like , know , epicor oracle infor particularly -- netsuite well . think netsuite built pretty successful offering retail apparel , example , made sequel spent last two year building vertical practice . think desire get operation , manufacturing , resource , supply chain , application really -- really lot functional domain expertise really designed particular industry , 's really under-penetrated segment term amount saas revenue driven guy , sort started small 've stayed small , 're sort one relatively niche space think desire get bigger broader mandeep singh robert mahowald mandeep singhworld , think set vendor 's , know , though broad work poised buy capability serve industry customer . security ? mean , saw one big deal year symantec , blue coat , n't pure-play cloud deal . still many point solution provider security space , think 're going see activity ? know , 's really good question . would say , 's possible , 'll give couple answer . one , think , ask customer , enterprise customer , responsible security outside firewall , example , know , network transport , firewall , thing like , know , vpn transporter , encrypted endpoint virtual private cloud . example , sits provider , lot desire push network security big isp vpn provider push cloud security -- either saas provider core set cloud provider , whether 's rackspace , google , microsoft , amazon , softlayer , ibm . say , well , happens inside firewall , 's something got add visibility , 's really ( technical diﬃculty ) . think 's changing little bit company realize live multi- cloud world way watch packet on-site , 's got managed uniform way slas core set provider outside firewall n't really cover need covered . , think look set , know , sort dsn , 'm sorry , dns provider know , core malware provider , think , know , they're going -- 's lot capability buy , think really big planned security around -- around -- around network transport security network visibility whole network . , player like akamai dyn , example , maybe , layer 9 , maybe f5 network . kind player , think kind broad picture security -- , seems top mind company trying push multi-cloud world build management network soup nut . okay . reminder everyone , submit question webinar link . please feel free . still 10 minute . , want move service . kind deal expect , accenture acquisitive last one year . , see trend part ? robert mahowald mickey north rizza robert mahowald yes . , mickey . work quite analyst look space , conversation , think important thing service guy buying much area need bringing workforce need . look number , know , thing found , know , accenture greatest acquisition since 2012 number acquisition 've . 's really interesting look deloitte , past , guess , 10 , 15 month , 've quite bit hit acquisition phase . really look , accenture seems meeting list long suite 've actually buying . , think 're going find , 's going continue , need help help company move forward new acquisition technology , bringing , also understanding business process going change really see continue evolve . robert , n't know thought ? yes . think , company , gsis particularly start use somebody else back-end . case amazon -- case accenture amazon , -- really -- really -- say spread across provider , 've parked asset elsewhere . think focus change people operation developer , people 've got domain capability , practice big data dx , example , think mind , 're buying people know coding , got , know , thought leadership expertise understand market moving . buy domain expert company , think , really -- somebody understands maybe 's fed space , maybe 's manufacturing , maybe 's retail , really , really well , durable code sell , know , think even important anymore whether 've got customer whether , know , 've operationalized , 's going matter much anymore . need people really run physical asset anymore . think 's -- expect see order magnitude purchase smaller buy , , know , smaller team functional domain experience mandeep singh robert mahowald mandeep singhhave got coding ability understand domain really well , kind like -- talked little bit software side , 's going acquired , think really domain industry player biggest . great . moving , mentioned industry cloud think couple big success story , veeva one term clubbed together functional area analytics regulatory compliance really shown steady growth last year , term addressable market , mean , 're going hit wall point . , think industry cloud consolidation going take place near-term long-term ? yes . , think , 're actually side curve , think 're really growth curve 're going see diversity player , know , across industry start emerge , think consolidation start happen , probably happen much reﬂexively . growth happens , consolidation happen think player really center gravity industry start edge see wisdom glomming onto somebody 's else 's cloud . 's sort virtuous cycle ( technical diﬃculty ) demand , 's developer want , that's lot customer place bet . , would say consolidation come ( technical diﬃculty ) winnowing among -- company smaller , hope big hope center gravity industry , know , building industry cloud , 'll see company really kind , know , huge place customer ' life huge place industry start sell industry cloud ( technical diﬃculty ) much concerned technical aspect industry cloud , sort table stake past perspective , understand 's really action , always say , know , industry cloud platform-as-a-service , know , company , really ( inaudible ) . 're , name name much , say , progress software 've got platform-as-a-service , really tremendous burning need develop go make money 's tremendous burning need need software work progress database environment really go . really sort create need , think successful entry cloud player stay drive transition one create , . question one listener . asking , best positioned provide cloud service federal government , civilian side especially defense side ? robert mahowald mandeep singh robert mahowald yes . would say , area 've got whole team government analyst look , n't think [ ph ] government , know , fedramp whole host dfca whole host requirement , notion become - - apply certification gain certification really diﬃcult tactical challenge requires great degree physical digital isolation platform , essentially , know , degree break model public cloud . requires , example , amazon skate business software go business , requires , know , build something net new expectation , know , federal government entity business follow , know , buildup . 'd say hurdle quite high would n't expect many company go step become , example , fedramp qualified , always , , think wise move platform economy sort -- leverage , know , leverage high-cost , high capital cost back-end provide set digital service , transformation service top think 's successful -- , 's successful formula . yes . , would say four five analyst government insight business think -- think talk stuff time great talk . talking amazon wrap . like hyper-scale guy , amazon , microsoft , google , guy acquire , know , kind enhance competitive positioning cloud , 're already dominated , kind acquisition would hyper-scale guy looking point ? , 're going looking three year road . 's almost kind -- 's kind would put moon-shot practice really thought could somebody n't already pretty well . , 's certainly thing like iot , 's thing like block-chain think 's getting -- 's bringing functional capability on-board . said earlier , really think race move lot customer stuff one big mega cloud provider start absorb spend pie . think understanding , know , complex customer problem n't even really know yet would try acquire . think , know , talked folk amazon google microsoft , particularly lot , think 's lot something verging hubris term think build . mickey north rizza robert mahowald mandeep singh robert mahowaldand 's -- think 're probably right technical engineering standpoint , level -- saying somebody day ( inaudible ) -- mickey day , talking team amazon two people whose full time job , fully optimize $ 246 supply part . get level optimization using odm direct-to-fab pretty much everything build , mean 've got sense build create service sell . think -- said , 's two three-year stuff think might willing , maybe something like 's governance message queue iot side , data rationalization , already , know , data warehouse functional file object block store kind piece would need iot kind offering . , think -- think amazon maybe somewhat separate case . would say , microsoft little bit different . think microsoft , know , built data center capability mega scale provider , would put slightly different provider perspective . -- think still gain -- 're still application space unlike one 've named . think still gain buying security provider , desktop virtualization provider , buying , know , application provider bigger portfolio , sure . 's would say . mickey , idea ? , think right track . really going long-term 's -- said , 's gain market share , quick grab , quick put together next step . , 's really moving faster think even human mind fathom overall perspective . yes , ( multiple speaker ) 'm sorry , go . , . complete thought , please . last piece , forgot mention , really , ai , machine learning , think , still convinced work 've done application cognitive team , convinced 's much , kind capability take core application provider particularly way league we've seen microsoft salesforce oracle sap , kind capability announced , tell -- , know , visiting friend waldorf couple week ago talking salesforce mandeep singh mickey north rizza robert mahowaldextensively , capability n't know , really want able complete whole workﬂow customer around ai part application transformation piece . something think sort tier mega cloud provider , particularly application space big deal . think 're ( technical diﬃculty ) need support , 've got -- get big marketplace application provider -- run , use infrastructure back-end . lot company say , need capability well , whole idea message queue data rationalization et cetera , machine learning . great . 's time . would encourage everyone take look & report bloomberg intelligence published terminal . available terminal user bi-isft . thank much , mickey robert . wonderful . learned much . really enjoyed discussion . hope everyone found useful , 'll look forward future webinars . thank . thank . thanks time .
