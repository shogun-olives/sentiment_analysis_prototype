good . well hello everyone , welcome keynote session afternoon . i'm excited today 'm joined thomas kurian , ceo google cloud . thomas took ceo google cloud almost exactly 2 year ago november 2018. 're going explore thomas ' strategy , 're going explore transformation 're seeing world technology , particularly around cloud . certainly incredible track record success already 2 year , 'm really looking forward talking . thomas , 've described strategist , technologist operator . competitor , peer , market , 's quite achievement three . certainly , 'm sure , one big driver 've successful many role . oracle 22 year , heading product development moved lead google cloud . 're graduate princeton engineering -- science degree mba stanford . certainly enormous credential take lead technology thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurianthat 's transforming business , transforming world . welcome , 're excited today . thank dave . 's pleasure joining discussion . lot ground cover , 'm going start maybe broad 're going explore different area cloud strategy . maybe would help audience talked initially -- talked initially strategy , came job 2 year ago , vision , perspective certainly cloud going 're taking google . maybe start kind bigger description google cloud strategy . yes , started simple understanding , 's driving shift cloud . went back early 2000 looked , lot software service . value proposition really around convenience , get something done much conveniently . next phase really data center service , put stuff data center lot around cost eﬃciency . looked talk customer , saw biggest shift driving adoption cloud around digitization , use data ? serve customer new way digitally ? strategy simple . wanted enable digitization business process using data different way different industry . wanted offering high scale infrastructure , platform data analytics solution specific industry industry different need . wanted online small medium business reach use capability online well build world-class sale customer service organization support large customer 've super- focused , executing strategy . 've seen kind disclosed investor , revenue grow significantly 2019 '18 , , impressive . started dig strategy building capability customer use . know partner big part strategy try bring value , think 've read talked whoever creates value capability along value chain large enterprise small enterprise going win end day . talk brought partner whole concept creating value bringing service cloud ? general view cloud provider 's going succeed end one 's differentiated , based solution offer , also david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckayecosystem partner solution top . , 've taken partner-friendly partner-focused effort . 've got -- identify specific place think partner complement u . work closely partner enable . 'll give couple example , -- every large company typically move partner help implement solution , product solution company , 're service company . , great relationship many largest service company world , accenture , deloitte , tc , wipro , infosys , others . 's taken lot work train team , enable deliver solution . 've identified many industry , best application provider industry . example neck wood dave , shopify , retail , felt retailer really going look e-commerce center piece , felt shopify great platform many retailer focused . work provide capability underlying platform . 've successful jointly . 've thoughtful approach enable broad breadth solution went along partner . think ip create together , lot -- started partnership certain place know , end different place year , 2 year , 3 year . think ip look partner 're co-developing many thing many client solution ? three different model ip work . place build solution , partner early adopter solution , 'll retain ip . customer get , example , partner get benefit part first experience solution . work 're large telecommunication company modernize contact center , example , using voice technology artificial intelligence , 's model 've done . second way work partner retains ip exclusively , meaning , 'll build platform learning , 're learning industry , solution domain . particular customer owns ip . third thing 've done case built joint platform take market together medical field , example , 're working mayo clinic bunch joint initiative take broader medical community together around digital health . three model ﬂexible depending industry , partner want working together . make complete sense . guess , partner strategy would also maybe touch would change trying use partner attract enterprise client versus medium-size small business client ? thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurian yeah , focused strategy geography , industry size client . example , specific partner great experience public sector institution , serving government . , set partner . different one latin america versus north america versus europe , instance . country-specific partner . example , strong presence particular country . definitely difference small medium enterprise versus large enterprise . need quite different , delivery model solution quite different , focused approach . something drive many core economy canadian economy , u.s. economy , small business drive economy . one thing found pandemic 'll pivot next . question bring small business u . n't resource access ai capability data set , need cloud-based service , need tailored . respond element market unmet need sure ? , significant business small medium enterprise . want make super easy small medium enterprise go website , log username credential , get access service . done lot work continue optimize ease adopt . example , see lot people building online presence , small retailer , small restaurant chain , small delivery company . pandemic , large one jostling presence online . even small medium business need online , focus quickly easily give tool-set get online , communicate customer , collaborate one another . 've incredibly pleased result 're seeing adoption tool . biggest barrier taking advantage tool certainly see movement scale , movement brand scale company-size , yet much employment rest small business , one thing together think helping small business along . know 're part solution cloud allowing access data insight capability ca n't afford . anything else 's stopping really competing successful digital world ? david i. mckay thomas kuriansome n't physical resource compete . look small retailer example , one big thing struggle supply chain , delivery capability et cetera . large company scale part 're trying side enabling digital business model , cost scaling digital business model much lower cost scaling physical business model . part effort help smaller medium enterprise , giving access technology technology large enterprise get access , made easier pick use . also give ability scale digital business model , big competitive advantage successfully . right . great point . started touching , obviously pandemic we're operating change challenge different segment economy , different size organization . first talk , leader , challenge operating world technology side , lead google cloud different thing coming . obviously increase demand service , 're responding leader challenge ? 've seen -- broad brush -- n't think 've perfect response , 've moving quickly . would say -- 've learned thing observing understanding could better . first one adaptive , 's lot discussion 've leadership team alphabet manage global workforce , employee . reality , pandemic hit different country different time . 've delegated lot decision local country leader , oﬃce leader situation new zealand , example , may look different united state even asia , different part asia . one . second think , keeping employee engaged throughout . 's variety different thing 've done . importantly , think giving sense purpose . purpose focused around customer 's keep people unified go forward . 've -- customer side , 's many new thing 've introduced , 've , focused evolving technology quickly . web conferencing technology example huge , huge growth user , minute scale technology support . 've people financial service , retail , gaming , huge spike traﬃc -- big part work working side-by-side enable able deal , support . 're proud employee done , focused making sure understand committed success well . lot different parameter , generally adaptive , looking ahead planning ahead recognizing purpose keep employee even david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurianduring diﬃcult time focused serving customer . lesson 've taken away . 'm sure many thing need better . think 're better leader human hybrid world purely physical -- purely digital world ? insight -- think today versus thought april different . 'm sure 'll think differently year , continue learn . learned 're innovative , work best human ? think 's combination thing 've seen . listen team , example , engineer , example , one thing 've seen , certain thing find actually much productive work home le disruption . time , lot , people say , design session sort one-off idea wanted discus colleague used grab around water cooler , 've talked example , team notion call on-site , off-site everybody oﬃce , off-site , order brainstorm , went off-site . people home we've done on-site off-site bring people together socially distanced oﬃce environment bit cohesive . think everybody learn continues . good thing working oﬃce setting , really good thing working home environment , blending two art future , mind . yes well said . absolutely . 's evolving , listening employee going critical try build engaged productive workforce future . 's brave new world , 's sure . maybe pivot -- certainly 're learning lot online business , online commerce , accelerated trend many area . talk think cloud role future even bigger opportunity cloud-based capability perspective changed coming -- past year ? know , 's interesting . look 're seeing different industry , almost every place work digitized . look , way people went hospital meet doctor , tele-medicine . people used go bank branch certain thing , want online . people used go store buy thing , 're buying thing online . first phase change saw notion digital front door every industry . way government distribute unemployment insurance small business loan benefit also gone online . david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckayso first phase . second phase help use data understand serve customer better . product service put front ? manage inventory better 'm retailer ? optimize supply chain ? third , , take lot physical process make eﬃcient . 're manufacturing , quality assurance better people stand next one another end manufacturing line inspect product service . , 've seen sort every phase accelerated significantly pandemic . 're seeing long-term shift use technology solve problem . every time think potential technology moving -- using data knowledge value , always stumble quality data first . getting data place create knowledge value , big barrier trying help largest enterprise firm , improve quality data , lead -- use tool 've built really harness far . approach qualitative data , 're right , probably biggest impediment able use new technology . , focus make easier software understand data fundamental level . , thing done understanding , instance , looking document , 's still lot people ﬂoating world . really able understand text paper really fundamental level . historically , people used talk natural language processing really thought understanding sentence word , reality human being expect understand conversation . conversation , leave lot thing assume implicitly remembered . , pushing boundary constantly able understand data fundamental level structured unstructured able describe , provide tool able analyze process much easy way people could . , massive amount data organization manages capital market side consumer side , truly differentiating capability . -- large enterprise small enterprise , seamlessly extract value data , derive different data point , apply tool built capability cloud , huge differentiating capability . , play , google 's cloud enterprise solution product capability different google advertising , google mail type capability . 's bring meet two world together leverage incredible horsepower original google capability . thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurian 's lot 're trying apply technology solve fundamental problem . 'll give two example . one retail , problem retailer face lot today , people went store buy thing , demand easy forecast store store basis . people buy online , want pick store , buy store , want thing shipped home , becomes extremely diﬃcult forecast manage inventory . inventory big part capital 's tied retailer . worked set tool help people really forecast inventory much accurately using expertise artificial intelligence , allows retailer plan example inventory differentiated way . similar example financial service . everybody worried fraud thing like anti-money laundering . one thing seen , look anti-money laundering , many different tool used today tenancy generate lot false positive . look , largely using older technology based rule rather newer tool technology . 're applying expertise artificial intelligence , large-scale data processing help solve business problem central retail , financial service , manufacturing thing . assist people problem solve elegantly . maybe 'll pivot , 've taken route next key element think strategy , remember , certainly around industry vertical talked . talked bit -- bit broadly mentioned retail financial service . specifically 'd like jump financial service , relevant u . certainly , talk vertical strategy , chose , arrange 're building compete ? yeah -- technology applies industry , see different industry focused different need 're trying deliver solution industry . primary industry public sector , financial service , retail , healthcare , manufacturing communication medium . look financial service , break financial service consumer institutional banking , wealth management , capital market insurance . different requirement . give illustration . goal use large-scale data processing streamline business process within organization , transform customer interface , allow people build new product source revenue . david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurianso look , example , insurance , 're working number leading insurance company around world , around important process . one example , change underwriting ? streamline claim processed ? third , put digital agent front consumer , may feel comfortable going insurance agent oﬃce still . , example 're taking base technology applying different domain different industry seeing -- enterprise customer always want problem solved , applied make , easier adopt . 're focused kind approach . big challenge say , 're working enterprise client say , yes , thanks helping re-engineer process , saved time money , 're allowed sell next competitor . something 's part agreement enterprise client 're ( inaudible ) premise , cloud going available industry participant ip separated kind repackaged ... vast majority client recognize , maintain ip able enhance , move faster . vast majority case people say , long work give advantage starting , 'm part early adopter program thing , recognize value come shared innovation people , find benefit . 've generally pleased 're able solve major customer problem well ( technical diﬃculty ) time maintaining overall curve innovation help player industry . jump financial service . obviously heavily regulated industry , thinking dealing regulator move bank insurance company onto google cloud service , regulator look , operation , ( technical diﬃculty ) system regulator ? convince , one evolving platform address requirement regulator . lot work 've done notion multi-cloud , able use google 's technology cloud platform data center customer provided significant benefit financial service around notion concentration risk , regulator concerned . second , put place operational practice policy . example , many european financial institution want data maintained europe . many financial institution certain access requirement access david i. mckay thomas kuriandata , put place lot operational practice govern use data , particularly financial service data . lastly , go regular audit regulator financial regulator country case europe , also european central bank , people policy organization work super closely understand want regulation go , evolving technology able support regulatory requirement . general , cloud becomes important part landscape industry different country , expect get requirement kind committed meeting . 've obviously thought . 's really good see question coming regulator start move service . , started pivot another key component understand , google strategy around multi-cloud , kind re-branded re-launched anthos , believe latin derivation , ﬂower . multi-cloud kind management capability . talk little bit multi-cloud strategy differentiates maybe unicloud competitor would maybe self describe ? use example , imagine back 1997 internet happening , said , certain web page available microsoft 's browser , web page available netscape 's browser web page available firefox 's browser , know , internet would succeeded would fragmented . approach , want enable organization , primary barrier adoption cloud organization skill-set . big part , n't think organization say , want three different cloud team , one google , one amazon , one microsoft , n't one team learn -- give choice want deploy . approach multi-cloud , complexity providing customer , ability use cloud provider choice , without locked provider . way build open programming model people build , deploy manage , secure workload . 's lot work 've done . went taking data analytics technology many , many people find differentiated , machine learning tool made available platform . reason , people said , use -- 've chosen someone else put data , bring data processing data opposed way around . feel , right customer give choice , eventually get success regulatory landscape evolved , notion sovereignty come , know , hey , want regional presence even example government -- public sector , depending change david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckayclassification certain kind information , people use different cloud . use multi-cloud give choice ﬂexibility 've seen really strong interest customer approach 've taken . talk little bit partner 've chosen execute multi-cloud containerization partner , kind tenderization strategy , obviously think thing choose cloud partner . broad set partner , fall four bucket . tool developer tool developer used deploy , also package application . second , tool allow run workload . third , tool migrate data , 's common requirement people want move data around . lastly , tool around security , secure environment . partner number . example , look security space , common requirement lockdown container , provide container security . good partnership palo alto network area . 's quite thing always clear want enable , tool provide 's partner ecosystem want bring solve problem ? 'm going beyond technical ability , unicloud competitor kind block strategy , ability run multi-cloud environment independently ? run multi-cloud environment independently . abstract underlying cloud provider ability block . right . right . 'm sure 've thought . 's great think talk regulatory corporate strategy , small business strategy , need manage short long-term risk , right , risk porting beholden one development capability something certainly think managing operational risk time . think 's fantastic strategy . touched another theme wanted discus . -- 's cybersecurity , something certainly 's omnipresent , heightened pandemic , see movement towards public cloud service processing capability , data residing see world endpoint , world 5g , 'll touch . talk security strategy protecting data , protecting partner , customer omnipresent cyber world ? thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurian philosophy around security , boil basic tenet . number one , make sure security easy operationalize . second , provide tool detect threat risk . third , make easy automatically remediate problem historically , 's also challenging . lastly , allow people choose configure system minimize way endpoint cloud . , 'll give couple example , one common thing felt , people would really like encrypt data . 's encrypted , 's much diﬃcult malicious people get access . historically , two diﬃcult thing , one making encryption possible hard , manage key , lot complexity . second , data encrypted rest transit . 's process , left wide open . , somebody could always open front door get access . , came solution encrypt data time , rest , motion , 's processed , also made super-simple people , let 's complicate manage . second example something felt strongly making easy detect 're compliance security practice . 've taken security converted configuration . operator look system say , secure . historically , use lot tool . super diﬃcult seesaw [ ph ] get sense , secure . , made much simpler threat detection capability identify , 're running secure environment . ( inaudible ) healthcare system , unloading healthcare data , maintaining hipaa compliance , today diﬃcult . lastly , 're working advanced solution around cyber protection even external attack . imagine , lot technology google 're applying domain think significant area work need done part industry . yes , really impressive 've built capability -- expect protect data rest say , motion , also processed within machine . think 's really , really important . , 'd obviously thought . talk kind 5g 's going change , 're processing data , 're making decision , impact kind cloud-based think security think capability world 5g ? know , 5g , given investment telecommunication company making 5g network , 5g network provide lower latency , also bandwidth . , given 's lower latency , -- 're integrating call mobile edge computing solution many different carrier david i. mckay thomas kurianaround world network . carrier network , actually computation run network . allows application , new kind application low latency available right network . see lot different solution . 're , providing technology platform mobile edge , 're also providing catalog solution specific industry partner ecosystem make easy customer adopt . 'll give practical example . 're working -- large manufacturing company run manufacturing shop ﬂoor . robot run shop ﬂoor clean room environment . control system computer talk robot therefore need close robot , 're factory ﬂoor , lot time technician go repair disk replace disk thing . , wanted u put network . working telecommunication partner 've built network . 's close factory . get low latency , disruption people walking repairing thing factory ﬂoor . allows get combination better value carrier carrier becoming -- network becoming locus application delivery better solution customer . right . 's great example , exciting usage model . talk little bit artificial intelligence . know 're running time , got couple topic may sort squeeze , last minute . ai much promise , much capability . talk exciting application seen ai . google invested heavily outside cloud ai capability , reinforcement learning . obviously , 'd think capability going brought cloud . barrier see really leveraging incredible technology ? talked data earlier . third question , 'll probably remind third question , little bit ethical ai think society using tool ? ( inaudible ) step ? see ai applied support augment human variety different industry field . example , 've done work using image recognition let radiologist better tool diagnose tumor image processing accurate , identify tumor cell . 've helped many manufacturing company image processing top shop ﬂoor quality inspection without human standing next one another , reduces risk human shop ﬂoor , also speed manufacturing line . many , many example place artificial intelligence , whether 's image processing , understanding data , helping people understand conversation going change way organization function use value data different way . david i. mckay thomas kuriannow time , 've also careful technology powerful one context also potentially negative consequence . example , work object detection , object detection instance , got human distress water example , detect help coastguard rescue easily . 's example project 're one part world . time , technology used identify whether person specific individual . technology human identification -- number potentially negative consequence , instance , would lead diversity inclusion bias . , we've careful putting forward ethical ai framework feel powerful technology , principle govern use technology . google adopted something called ethical ai , 've put forward set principle meant govern use ai product , expect people using ai use . also meant foundation discussion technology company policy maker 's right way ai used world . also 's great example . 's fascinating . double , side equation , trying help also trying protect confidentiality ethical side amazing . 'd like ask one question , know couple minute left , one important issue 've dealt within society leader building fairer , inclusive society going forward , touched . talk little bit , mean , thought building fair inclusive society 're leading within google ? general view technology still something distinguish , person race nationality , unique advantage create next technology . , view , need representative provide opportunity people background able create new technology innovative google . u , boil four thing , recruiting diverse inclusive population ? helping develop people diverse background ? promoting rewarding ? retaining ? specific work going every one area , working people operation team , employee 's matter great importance u want place represent -- build representative technology well representative organization . thing 've change example , people often think educate manager n't hire cultural fit , hire evolve culture organization . , n't hire people make feel comfortable , hire something make organization stronger 's representative broader community live work . , lot work 're , constantly paying attention , see way improve organization we're david i. mckay thomas kurian david i. mckay thomas kurianlearning also discussing many university , different organization . matter great importance u . well said . think 's definition diversity right different perspective hiring likeness challenging think differently . 's important point . thomas , go another hour , right , know 've taken lot time appreciate time spent u today . think 've -- 've covered lot topic . hope everyone feel power technology 're building , 're going different multi-cloud vertical partner 've built differentiate capability . future going transform small large enterprise , bringing power ai , bringing power processing data , re-engineering process within vertical put capability transformational technology . excited able talk conference today thing 're building feel future 's fingertip 're building . , behalf everyone , sincere thank great conversation today . thank much , dave . 's pleasure joining . well 'm sure 'll see soon . behalf entire audience , sincere thank . thank much .
