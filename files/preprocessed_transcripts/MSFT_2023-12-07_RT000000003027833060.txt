hey . welcome next session . 'm really happy , rajesh . one thing speaker microsoft always like , 're big organization , right ? 's positive thing . 're always like , well done , 's amazing . 's positive thing big elephant dance . yes . maybe get everyone page , talk little bit role microsoft . yeah . lead experience & device microsoft . would microsoft 365 oﬃce team , window surface , also search browser effort . question answer ( question answer ) think last 12 month , 's like crazy journey term new innovation , et cetera , like . talk little bit like experience , like last 12 month guy -- like kind funding well ? - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha yeah . mean , first , let say , know , mean last 12 month exciting time . yes . 've microsoft long time . came graphical user interface , thought big deal , internet , mobile . mean , last 12 month , actually think generative ai big technology shift , bigger put together . u , last 12 month , got lot done . reﬂect back , gpt4 -- production year . -- jan , apis azure safety trust enterprise customer expect . february , took large model , put socialnet browser , think represented new way people find information reason stuff . march , took step back thought , productivity ? would generative ai , power thing affect impact way work done ? june , brought private preview lot enterprise customer . 's great journey . november , launched microsoft 365 copilot . reﬂect back , course , github copilot first one went clear could help developer incredibly productive . . last month , 've also taken look business process business workﬂows re-taught world generative ai , take system engagement take natural language natural language interface bring whether salesforce 's workﬂows , service provider 's workﬂows , whether doctor's workﬂows copilot thing . 've thought extend copilot allow customer developer extend copilot specific information . lot 's happened , thing 'll tell lot technology shift also intersected work 've anyway microsoft 365 , post- covid . 've spent lot -- saw lot customer engagement intensity populated call microsoft graph , represents customer 's important database , think , project , know , term knowledge , people 's calendar , email document , right permissioning . generative ai reasoning engine meet microsoft graph provide generative ai ﬂow work . q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jhaso -- still 's early , , exciting see entire company rally . guy must thinking little bit ahead . like -- wanted ask like slightly bigger picture , like , thing , generative ai , insight u . like , -- would think way work change time , like going forward ? like glimpse give u ? yes . mean , look , 'm soothsayer stuff , let share already seeing customer . yes . early adopter program june microsoft 365 copilot , many hundred customer jump opportunity see thing . 100 200 , went really deep . invited microsoft go deep analyze impact productivity . looked three dimension productivity . one eﬃciency , quickly get job done much go . balance taking look quality work , 's enough ai assist something quickly , mean , quality output term accuracy , term up-level skip-level . third thing looked effort . much effort , much grind take ? result really impressive . going publish work trend index think coming day . 68 % 72 % people felt made eﬃcient . improved quality work . felt put le effort , time innately human , creative , reﬂective work , collaboration . 70 % would say , course , copilot make generative ai make productive . 's also telling 55 % people feel ai make creative . today . ask question , see move forward ? think workﬂows going re-imagined . today copilot ai help existing workﬂows . lot grinding -- let take step back copilot , vision copilot autopilot . work agency , work permission , work context . today , helping existing workﬂows . 's helping everyone , entire group 's workﬂows change reimagined ? starting see team customer . q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha yes . one -- want leave one thought . far ai , prior generative ai , human being work , ai editor . would show auto-complete , grammar check , spell check . , 's ﬂipped . ai work . 're first draft . 're summarization . human being editor . 've gone ai editor , human being editor ai assistant . rajesh , -- like reimagining workﬂows , et cetera , like -- example make slightly comfortable u ? like , hear , n't hear , know mean . yeah , yeah . 's -- let give couple example , maybe one -- couple customer example , maybe one team . one customer , -- people started using copilot , first thing tried figure , hey , go ? asked u , distribute seat across different department go , one department ? -- based work , tell , go one function find taking peer group giving copilot help reimagine workﬂow . customer , gave service department . 're operational company . complicated process long running incident hundred people -- incident would day long . core company . complicated overhead -- people work four-hour shift incident next crew came , going transfer knowledge , going come speed . re-imagined -- re-imagined entire workﬂow context copilot meeting . new person would come , copilot would summarize . could , `` hey , summarize happened last six month ? one apply specific function ? '' able get rid lot manual overhead , human overhead transferring knowledge shift . example reimagining workﬂow . another drug research company 's corpus lot data around clinical trial drug research , 's different system . -- extended copilot . copilot , people could summarize quickly came , latest finding last q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jhaweek colleague context email come around , chat , document , plus 's message record . team , saw super interesting thing . product manager want go incubate idea , process used , would come idea product management team , 'd go lobby resource engineering team design team could co-incubate . , us copilot . product manager early career , incubation idea , used copilot generate , n't know coding . 's designer . idea . used copilot create perfectly workable , mobile app incubate bunch stuff . got try lot different thing , , idea stated , brought core team actually go implement . saved , specific scenario , month time coordinating people . think see workﬂows going reimagine , addition augmenting human ingenuity creativity taking grind . yes . -- maybe started actually , think copilot productivity gain . started github copilot side . yes . like , first guy using oﬃce side . like seeing term productivity gain seeing work behavior coming one ? github , 's -- first thing , github copilot many way blazed trail u design language . spent lot time -- ai get instantiated team user organization . mean , 's secret ai get thing wrong . , course , ground information rag pattern , 're using reasoning engine , fact engine . github copilot taught u design language copilot , autopilot . working behalf making sure human loop actually accept change commit action . saw github copilot land 50 % , 55 % eﬃciency developer , thing created copilot stack . mean copilot stack , take look microsoft 365 copilot , largest model , capable model . 's fact , model grounded microsoft graph permission 's brought q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jhainto copilot design language user experience use . -- need extensible . entire thing call copilot stack . copilot microsoft built orchestration , extensibility , design language . 've made thing available azure service , whether azure ai studio low-code , no-code copilot studio . think many way , github copilot blazer trail u one design language . seeing term customer working copilot adoption curve ? 'm telling 'm coming , 's like , look , productivity gain , 're hearing somewhere like 20 % , 30 % , like 50 % . people working kind developer , white-collar worker , 're expensive . think like , hang , like everyone rushing , getting . like thing adoption consider like kind experience far ? yes . , great question . , 's clear end user , whether 's context creation , summarization , first draft , , payoff , mean , -- talking going see work trend index , benefit 50 % , 60 % , 70 % , term meeting , summarization , follow-up task 80 % 85 % . , 's clear value end user . , let 's talk admin enterprise . 're also responsible security , regulation , compliance , . one thing 've done microsoft 365 copilot actually built enterprise-grade . mean understands thing like additional access . policy place , raimo outside zip code try access code data , allow access ( inaudible ) challenge authentication , copilot understands policy . thing like interaction copilot discoverable regulatory reason generates audit log . 've done work . still go validation process thing . one piece feedback got early , hey , love notion copilot helping meeting , want create data retention policy transcript retained enable copilot . work could get copilot perform meeting without creating transcript last meeting . bunch evaluation adoption , adoption guided microsoft adoption , microsoft.com , reason . one hear customer , know roi ? built copilot dashboard . actually go take look impact copilot . join custom data . bring hr 's custom data , bring sale performance custom data join copilot data see roi . 've gone built . q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschowand end user , really teach new way computing . u grown keyboard , mouse , white gesture . using prompt . good prompt sale person ? 's good prompt organization , manufacturing context ? copilot lab . end day , copilot going go bit adoption cycle enterprise got work risk , got work compliance procurement make sure auto like . time value copilot , feel , unlike anything 've done enterprise space last 20 year , much , much , much faster , think microsoft graph already exists , 's built enterprise-grade , show ﬂow work . like -- mentioned microsoft graph lot , actually , think side , pay enough attention . got lucky like play ? actually , 's super -- , would say . , 's happened . go back oﬃce business , oﬃce business , premise , bunch silo . n't understand user well . understood job . exchange outlook , understood mail calendar job . sharepoint oﬃce , understood document management . link time , understood meeting tele thing . stuffed pipe . moved cloud , really got user-centered . 's microsoft graph . -- reason stuffed pipe on-premises customer could deploy product time . every silo standalone able exist , even pure silo different version . cloud , one data structure customer . job , keeping up-to-date . 's allowed graph get created . covid accelerated use microsoft 365 , lot intensity . use microsoft 365 , better graph . covid , ton customer deeply immersed microsoft 365. graph healthy , permissioned . get generative ai , take graph , ground generative ai graph context . yeah . say , bring user experience people using today , that's microsoft copilot . 's differentiation microsoft copilot . - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jhayeah . wanted shift gear little bit . like , mean way compute ? like , first , fundamentally , also , microsoft moment , much demand side , copilot , et cetera . external demand azure . , like , 's getting gpu ? yeah . mean , first , mean , look , gpt-4 built azure , 've optimizing layer stack year . said , answer question , think couple way . course , customer , come azure , use frontier model openai , use model hugging face meta . model service 've announced use mistral 's premium model , coherence model , j 's model . use lot model . large model use first party application azure openai api , 've done work leverage one implementation one stack . 's -- optimize usage gpus across bing , window , oﬃce dynamic azure openai use apis . third party using apis , -- come bring model . use plethora model . use large model , getting leverage fact using api , endpoint . , course , underneath cover , clearly close partnership nvidia , course amd , ai-first silicon bringing picture . think waterline systems-level work we've optimizing long time year . silicon-level work . waterline , hitting large model , get optimize traﬃc across first party , anybody using azure openai api . okay . excellent . , investor relation getting little bit nervous , tried ask like number -- number question , like monetary question . think , 're creating ai lot value client . look pricing , 's still like , look $ 30 per user , 's still like classic model like , 's price , think like github copilot , like $ 9 . tell , talk customer 're like , 's steal 20 % productivity gain 'm paying $ 9 guy cost $ 150 'm getting 20 % , like , give . think dynamic going forward ? like , rethink re-imagine ? well , mean , let say , early day , yes . thing believe , take look oﬃce . oﬃce existed , word business application , excel business application . said , , want democratize q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschowthis user . microsoft copilot , github copilot democratization ai user . , basically , said , `` hey , want take core capability used productivity , ai enhance productivity . want take user . '' like 've done oﬃce . addition per user , lot construct top , whether e5 construct , whether team premium construct . right , really way thinking ai let 's bring every information worker , every first line worker , get enhance productivity 'm sure lot opportunity u add value capture value . yeah . since 're kind working experience side microsoft , need reimagine ui going forward ? classic way , like good generative ai system interactive , like 's work ? super good question . 35 year , computing n't changed term way , 're phone , swipe . pc , use keyboard mouse , operating system basic job abstracting away hardware allowing get application . yes . 's going change . way 'll see u integrate copilot , example , window , think line shell , search , browser , copilot going blur . enable something understands intent higher level natural language . take lot grunge . application relationship operating system , copilot , going evolve rapidly , 'll start see u stuff bringing copilot window . 's going exciting , think 's new paradigm user experience . yeah . kind get question around device . like guy always good showing partner 's possible . like -- actually , remember surface came , bought , loved , like , oh , cool , kind -- way , almost forced innovation partner side . , way -- , way , like need kind almost reimagine device , et cetera . mean , 're announcing something , thinking ? - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha think natural use -- natural user interface , multimodal , way , n't natural language , speech video stuff . think existing hardware form factor going evolve accommodate . new form factor . yeah . let 's leave like . let 's leave like . yeah . tried . yeah . okay . thing like , switching -- shifting gear little bit back kind adoption -- client adoption see copilot side , like 's thinking term speed adoption support given shortage gpus , like see playing ? give like every client -- like limited amount every client ? like one client get lot , learn lot ? think , play field ? yeah . open business customer copilot . 's really like earlier conversation , customer going evaluation security policy , governance , procurement , . feel confident ability optimize across first-party usage third-party usage . . know go optimize capacity . okay . yeah . would n't like -- barclays say , like -- think we're big team shop guy . say want copilot everyone , 's going like , , could , theory . yeah . 'm happy sign right . yeah . 's , yeah . want talk team tell 're enterprise-grade . q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha q - raimo lenschow - rajesh jha yeah , yeah , yeah . mean -- last question like , think guy working partner ? , one like microsoft-centric view , hand , like , 's , 's like whole broader world . like , seeing evolving guy term working people , bringing people equation going forward ? super good question . mean -- , back day bill used run company , mean remember meeting , would take incredible pride every dollar microsoft would create , would create $ 3 ecosystem . , really platform company , azure layer , even m365 layer . already team , 2,000 isvs countless line- of-business application extend team . see platform sensibility , talked build ignite coming year build , 'll talk developer , line-of-business developer inside organization well isvs augment copilot custom logic inner activity , -- productivity still human various form . 're going build interesting application . , want copilot -- microsoft 365 copilot platform , working . n't know chance take look , raimo , ignite probably three week ago , showed lot lot customer partner actually extending microsoft copilot . yes . think -- yes , 's -- mean , conference really exciting . like , 's really nice see innovation coming . , guess , hey , 's 58 second german , time . nice job . thanks joining . thank . really enjoyed conversation . thank , raimo . thank much . thank , everyone .
