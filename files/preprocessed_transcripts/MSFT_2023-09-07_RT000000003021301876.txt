'll let charles introduce -- minute , charles look dynamic 365 business , think kind underappreciated area microsoft growth story . 's lot thing excited . charles , first , thanks making trip , surviving humidity heat new york . could start , share background . know 've microsoft couple different time , history microsoft role responsibility current role ? absolutely . first , thanks . super excited conversation today . i've microsoft two time , right university short stint . company . founder something called metricshub , acquired microsoft little 10 year ago . company focused public cloud cost management health monitoring , let 's say early day iaa paas . worked azure five year , integrating , working thing . 've business application microsoft last five half , six year . 's dynamic 365 , 's power platform , kind across journey , 've seen pretty broad shift business look like microsoft think exciting way . despite , 'd say , still think developer heart . 's started career , least recovering developer . question answer ( question answer ) - charles lamannaright . recovering , yes . dynamic 365 , 's obviously broad encompassing business , right ?

'd say kind broadly break two part , answer . first , look dynamic business application general , get excited customer asking u help transform business process . , know take run marketing campaign ? take run sale process ? revenue generation look like 2023 ? manage supply chain ? manage financials ? specific problem workﬂows line business every single department . customer look u , historically , great platform enable improve solve issue like azure use oﬃce , right ? business application make possible u off-the- shelf , ready-made , fast time value solution area . 's business application . 've able find lot success last five year , really going three , think , main change think strategy . first , complete move cloud . n't really meaningfully five six year ago , dynamic -- dynamic 365 , 100 % saas , 100 % hosted public cloud , 've . dynamic revenue $ 5 billion last fiscal year u . 80 % cloud . big shift happened investment really modernizing meaningful way . like talk thing like generative ai , agility 're seeing dynamic born cloud migration . 's kind one big change . second thing business application , historically , 's big focus big monolithic investment . like full crm full erp full scm , different acronym . mean 's high cost adoption enterprise . frequently looking one system whole company . ever want switch thing , 's huge budgetary hit , way service software . 've done 've taken dynamic 've decomposed individual module , customer easily adopt departmental workﬂow level . n't replace whole crm . use contact center one business . n't move entire supply chain u . move , say , part warehouse management type thing . modularization allowed u really break established market without huge service cost . mean last thing , product perspective , thing exciting u really got comfortable idea part microsoft . microsoft business application company , like 's cloud infrastructure company . 's lot different capability one roof . got comfortable making dynamic 365 integrate broader microsoft ecosystem . use oﬃce q - tyler radke - charles lamanna q - tyler radke - charles lamanna q - tyler radkelike team excel , best way connect business application use dynamic 365. similarly , want go manage data warehousing analytics ai azure , dynamic 365 best easiest way go . really kind integrated , single microsoft platform something customer hungry continue hungry . data silo , kind walled garden , type thing . really three thing , 'd say like big change last year really accelerated business . okay . okay . yes , talked big change . one question get lot investor , look dynamic 365 growth , 's actually accelerated . meanwhile , competitor , certainly crm space seen growth slow . would mainly attribute internal investment made platform maybe talk -- 's impacting ability compete take share kind respective category ? yes , mean 'd say kind 's laid foundation sure kind growth 've seen . mean , last year , 's lot generative ai momentum , . think 's also played major part . think getting cloud public cloud , agility update feature release super differentiated compared lot business application vendor . kind go look modularization , 's found way get business talking replace whole crm , replace whole erp , instead let 's start department , start function . prove earn right get department function . yes . yes . okay . 's kind consistent across crm marketing whatever kind application . absolutely , yes . think probably shape little bit different . 's , say , crm erp side , like crm , 's much end-to-end ownership process within department line business . customer service , say , consumer business bank . whereas erp 's sometimes like call like multi-tier architecture erp headquarters , edge , say , running warehouse manufacturing plant , may use dynamic post back hq . slightly different shape , idea . - charles lamanna q - tyler radke - charles lamannayes . talking generative ai . think 's hard conversation microsoft without bringing . summer , saw pretty interesting demo announcement around crm , copilot . know talking lot event fall look forward , kind see -- guess , investor look forward fall term generative ai capability specific dynamic ? feedback customer since launch ? yes . mean , biggest thing , think 're past point -- mean , 're still going announcement , 're past point say announcement demo press release . 's immense amount generative ai product market , generally available dynamic . shipped first gpt-3 powered feature even gpt-3.5 back early 2021 market . 've incredible customer story , incredible adoption example . think lot conversation around dynamic showing people done product . like one example , blog post published morning talking 've adopted copilot crm microsoft benefit 've seen . one world 's complex customer support organization , ten thousand people , hugely diverse product window xbox azure . use copilot 100 day rolling , able see 12 % improvement department productivity . basically long take work customer support case . level productivity benefit measurement economist , statistically significant a-b testing type thing . n't really seen area 30 year since original digitization personal computer . -- 's kind early inning . we're seeing customer adopt , 'll see customer story coming think lot 'll look forward . product perspective , 're early inning generative ai . 's lot exciting stuff coming . yes . yes . think dynamic business , 's obviously ton different customer , could talk demand trend 're seeing ? mean , 're serving smbs dynamic , think increasingly enterprise , maybe departmental enterprise . would kind compare contrast 're seeing demand front , given macro environment ? yes , mean one thing seeing price sensitivity . hear customer go evaluate crm erp , getting value expect price 're paying ? go look market , there's already high per user price , getting even higher lot case . also thing like ai additional charge top . customer discerning make sure they're getting return expect product . many customer q - tyler radke - charles lamanna q - tyler radke - charles lamanna q - tyler radkeconversations start 's going cost 's value 'm going get productivity perspective end . pretty different , say , environment past , maybe , course , need crm , 'm going get crm , course , need erp cloud , 'm going get erp cloud . good news 've encouraged inﬂuenced decision , 've done thing like n't increased price dynamic 365 cloud . think 's high per-user price already , reasonable , fair price . 've also gone ahead included copilot capability dynamic existing enterprise license , main license customer buy . like e3 -- exactly , yes . like get dynamic 365 enterprise , standard sku , come sale copilot customer service copilot finance copilot . combination largely inﬂuenced kind conversation customer . allowed u really nail roi . think entire time 've business application microsoft , 've never seen environment like right 's appetite switching crm erp level reason . go back value get per dollar spend . yes . yes . 's interesting . guess sale perspective , know 're product root development , -- kind sale incentive structured microsoft go-to-market organization , obviously one biggest planet ? dynamic crm getting quota retirement incentivizing dynamic business way really drive even ? yes . mean , like mainline sale organization microsoft strongly incentive drive business application , dynamic 365 power platform . 's mainline investment u . also specialized sale resource globally , focused dynamic 365 power platform . think -- like maybe huge change past year , 's top-line priority across sale organization . yes . take step back think tam microsoft application . mean , 're touching lot different front oﬃce , back oﬃce , mid oﬃce , 'll call , well , probably hundred billion dollar . kind think , , addressability microsoft portfolio capture tam ? generative ai kind accelerate even increase tam ? - charles lamanna q - tyler radke - charles lamannaso look business application , 've historically thought tam ballpark $ 150 billion per year . 's substantial tam . mean , span lot different category , 's crm , erp , new cdp , hcm , even increasingly blurring like service management like itsm . 's kind big opportunity , also include low code rpa . kind view one business application start offering , help customer transform business process , $ 150 billion . within , kind think dynamic 365 power platform key growth engine u . like hopefully , talk little bit power platform , think 's area really lot upside u , particularly generative ai . look $ 150 billion , 're encouraged microsoft's opportunity inside 's extremely fragmented , right ? 's different lot big software market category participate 's fragmented across $ 150 billion . really mean kind one's run away . 're also encouraged 's high margin business , something always -- mean , scale high margin great . also think 's going pretty profound transformation many different front . mean , first one 're seeing big change buyer really focused roi , different . 's taken fact , go upgrade crm erp every year . also customer looking new value proposition around productivity . 's generative ai great , productivity boost . kind market changing lot . got high fragmentation , high opportunity , high margin , lot disruption . think microsoft exceptionally well positioned lead disruption existing market , largely 's generative ai . 's integrating broader estate , type thing . yes , think 's big , 's getting bigger . generative ai increase technology spent , yes . great . well , 's great segue want move power platform , know 're excited . maybe 'd great kind define like different product power platform . know power used lot different microsoft project , kind evolved ? certainly fabric announcement build may , kind thinking next evolution considering 's kind new vision integrating data analytics , power platform ? yes . folk may n't familiar power platform , 's power bi self- service analytics reporting , power apps web mobile application development , power automate workﬂow robotic process automation , power page website development power virtual agent chatbots , conversational agent . whole bunch different capability united q - tyler radke - charles lamannafact 're call low-code . low-code basically mean , historically , 's drag drop , visual authoring environment opposed drop write code , like javascript c-sharp java , python . benefit low-code developer professional lot productive . great study 6x 7x productive solution build using low-code . also , start empower business user also create solution . someone finance department use power bi analyze last quarter without go . someone hr department create web application , people use hr task without go turn around get . go , say , supply chain core operation use power automate automate task . idea full company creation full company development really critical make customer basically build solution need . 've seen last decade , there's pretty much insatiable desire create digital solution every single enterprise everywhere . n't think 'll find cio ever say , enough resource enough developer build solution want . power platform start make attainable . 's kind power platform . -- shared 's 33 million monthly active user , growing 50 % year-over-year , really massive user base , something think going grow . shared past , like business measured billion dollar well cloud . power platform concept , coined early 2019. young product u . go look kind space go future , think large market opportunity . think increasingly lot development done , lot digital transformation done . kind , though , product portfolio , 's going reimagined generative ai , probably power platform . 's really start make even simple , even straightforward create solution . yes . 's kind three pillar , guess , power platform . got power bi , data analytics . got low-code , no-code development tool , kind automation rpa , guess . seeing , guess , momentum customer ? kind think fabric , category kind get innovates fastest fabric announcement ? yes . yes , think 's exactly right . like probably biggest three category three . think look power bi , power apps power automate , think market leader three area adoption usage kind lot great study reﬂecting well . probably three big category . look fabric , fabric kind reﬂects hear customer . ask u constantly , put thing power platform . take historically dev-only , data science-only concept make accessible low-code . example , expose q - tyler radke - charles lamannagpt model power platform . expose complex , say , like operation around analytics inside power platform far . fabric kind next evolution . idea take power bi , great reporting analytics , expand encompass thing like data warehousing , data storage , data movement ? make easier developer work business user create solution ? like fabric kind natural progression . would say , probably expect u keep expansion power platform 's customer come push u . ca n't grow dev team , ca n't grow budget , want grow output . power platform faster easier . yes . one big driver oﬃce 365 broadly frontline worker opportunity . kind think addressability power platform ? maybe hit dynamic , , context frontline worker opportunity , microsoft lot success . yes . mean , like one thing 's interesting like frontline worker historically underserved market come digital technology . 's 's lot apps built . go look app dev budget , kind go , back oﬃce development customer-facing development frontline worker development , kind always end playing like third fiddle . really focused power apps making easy create mobile application frontline worker 're really - - stand apart n't pc . n't wheel around computer , say work retail location manufacturing plant inside , say , like hospital . mobile application development 's easy power apps . amazing story company like walgreens boot retail location great example like ikea retail location , even say manufacturing plant scenario gsk . like example frontline application historically pen paper data entry , call someone , become true standardized mobile application . we've kind seen renaissance development focused frontline worker using power apps . 's thing customer build , 's also ship box . dynamic 365 field service , much focused frontline worker , help work order , track task , mixed reality capability . 've seen field service together back oﬃce , say scheduling management workforce , really strong combination customer . kind power apps plus field service , start cover lot scenario historically digital support . q - tyler radke - charles lamanna q - tyler radke yes . certainly seems like big opportunity kind one maybe microsoft uniquely positioned go . got 18 minute left . know 's packed room . 's question , feel free raise hand , 'm sure could keep going longer 18 minute . one thing want hit , given background , 've worked azure business referenced cost optimization kind original product built . 's kind perspective ? know 're focused day-to-day , 's kind perspective ? 're talking lot customer term cloud optimization . tail end ? anything 're hearing , given 's focus historically ? yes . mean like large azure customer , even internally , like always go constant optimization . mean , thing would say like , optimization probably something always exist public cloud . mean always existed . think big question , swing towards digital solution le optimization time ? one thing seeing hearing consistently customer generative ai . know 's like everything generative ai , really changing conversation past , go reduce vms , reduce data warehouse , type thing . 's much , bring workload ai enabled transform function responsibility company ai enabled ? reason customer shift side large productivity benefit . mean , 10 % productivity boost . mean 's something n't ever get really single technology implementation single project . lot opportunity like across board . thing true software company build azure . 're trying integrate generative ai application . like every microsoft product definitely copilot today . customer want copilot like experience well . 's changed conversation definitely . 's kind one key aspect . maybe kind thought would like , generally what's great public cloud fact optimization . 's like buy server , got wait three , four year depreciate . actually turn server book saving . promise we've making public cloud 10 year . customer benefiting . think come , help drive workload cloud people seen opportunity actually kind dial needed . yes . hit interesting point around roi productivity gain , obviously copilot , certainly 've talked customer using copilot , hear great feedback , obviously one want pay . - charles lamanna q - tyler radke - charles lamannaarea like knowledge worker certainly user , appreciate productivity give . seeing customer measure justify roi ? term hour happiness organization ? talk like hard measuring tool 're using justify investment copilot ? yes . would say definitely climate think employee happiness maybe main motivator . like -- 's going depend department-by- department . think one great benefit like different business application really understand productivity look like seller . mean 's revenue per head , right ? fast close deal what's revenue generated per seller . productivity look like customer support ? many case work per day 's cost per case ? every -- go basically company , know two metric we're able , say , rollout copilot measure . that's something -- like mentioned microsoft 've done clearly look say , okay , kind composition workforce change term expertise copilot really augment new hire thing like . also really boost productivity closing case per day . 's kind one example . go like finance supply chain , many finance employee per dollar revenue generate . supply chain , 's -- much inventory keep , long take fulfill order , often deliver full time ? business metric think go cfo , cro , cio , know like . copilot move needle . kind -- maybe 've little bit pessimistic say like , historically , 's hard show benefit . copilot , 's hard . customer work , roll thing , metric improve . think talk new buying environment wanting roi productivity benefit , 's 're going see customer . 'll adopt crm show rpa , revenue per head , per seller . 'll adopt case management tool show case resolved per day . 's kind shift much across board . okay . okay . 's helpful color . cfo talked ai one microsoft 's fastest growing fastest growing business $ 10 billion . think contribution dynamic power platform $ 10 billion target ? yes . think -- first thing like , could tell , , bullish ai mean microsoft . think go look , like hear customer , appetite immense . look business application specifically , think like overweighted contribution compared , say , historical cloud revenue microsoft . exactly look like , 's lot q - tyler radke - charles lamannathings moving right , hard say . 're really seeing happen three thing business application . first , like mentioned earlier , put copilot dynamic 365 existing application , additional fee . benefit sell bread butter . like lot share gain many year row 've outgrown market . think really help u accelerate core offering . win deal , sell deal , competitive , 're already seeing . kind core product go faster . second , add-on make sense , ai oriented part dynamic 365 power platform . example , power apps , something called ai builder , use ai model application . get certain amount credit , want lot ai , buy ai add-on . , support gpt , draw lot ai capacity . 're seeing rapid adoption around ai builder , example , inside power apps . 'll see add-on attachment make sense . third thing entirely new ai-first product . microsoft sale copilot , 's generally available . product crm . fact , work crm , make seller productive wherever work . whether 's outlook , whether 's team , whether 's window , whether 's go , sale copilot make productive ai assistant help better conversation , prepare meeting better , understand account better , type thing . new ai-first application , think huge opportunity u 're net new revenue line 're also entirely greenfield market . go company , n't sale copilot today . like crm kind constant , connect microsoft crm , type thing . think three drive lot revenue biz apps near term . like next 12 month , 's primarily going core bread butter product selling add-on . go three year , 's going increasingly ai first product . like github copilot great example . right . right . hit kind greenfield opportunity maybe sale copilot . could talk little bit kind big opportunity could ? yes . like microsoft sale copilot , charge $ 40 per user per month connect non-dynamics 365 crm . 's included $ 95 per user per month dynamic 365 user license . think every single seller pretty short period time sale copilot like . think -- kind p time q , think 's big opportunity u . 's like see lot announcement going way back modern work announcement copilot back march , sale copilot major feature announcement . think 's huge opportunity around copilot , work q - tyler radke - charles lamanna q - tyler radke - charles lamannabusiness application vendor bring generative ai value user spends time , case crm usually crm , right ? actually inside oﬃce . right . ultimately $ 40 could way onboard broader dynamic license organization . yes . okay , guess -- mean , hit interesting point earlier like , clearly , budget tight . microsoft think really benefited environment term consolidation potential , like 've seen security , 've seen certainly across power bi data analytics . could argue maybe n't seen yet application side crm marketing erp . guess , 's kind confidence level maybe 's could happen next three five year ? guess , ai catalyst maybe drive similar consolidation wave application layer like 've seen productivity power platform ? yes , like -- mean , high level , look , say , module talked earlier , say , customer experience , service , finance supply chain , we've able $ 1 billion . many year running , 've gaining market share relative competition across . think something , working market growing kind climate way 're happy -- think 're pretty happy . go future , think 's real opportunity reason . first , think hit really great price point dynamic company maybe struggle hit . 's term eﬃciently run eﬃciently microsoft go market . 's -- think going huge asset business application $ 95 per user sound like lot relative , say , maybe something like oﬃce 365 , 's actually low list price compared classic crm erp . think price something interesting . second , value include standard cloud-based crm erp bell whistle , leadership , pretty clear leadership position generative ai business application included great price . kind look two thing , great set price , great set value , really leading way next generation business application . two thing together , think really help u go drive standardization adoption dynamic . think copilot general , one thing we've talked lot think copilot start blur line productivity application business application . q - tyler radke - charles lamannaand 've probably seen event past 'd , say , talk outlook team excel . different event , talk dynamic power platform . event talk thing together . reason copilot , 'm , say , excel want analyze financial data , n't want go erp export data go web search information . copilot bring data right context analysis inside excel . 'm writing e-mail customer , n't want go leave outlook crm look account pricing . want copilot bring data right 'm working . idea le application switching data intelligence brought work , oﬃce business worker oﬃce , going really big benefit microsoft broadly . 'd say , think 's price value consideration , 's also product category merging blurring that's happening , . got . yes . competitive side crm business , highlighted price point nearest competitor big conference next week also announced price increase . guess , seen increased engagement customer maybe large customer renewal table q3 , q4 ? kind seeing increased appetite customer re- platform result price increase elsewhere kind attractive price point copilot functionality ? yes . mean like shorter like , yes , n't think 've level -- like mentioned earlier , level switching conversation entire five , six year 've business application , 've never higher right . would say like , every conversation 'm , say , ceo , cio , cfo , boil two thing . 's total cost next five year microsoft versus vendor ? 's favorable equation . 'd say cfo really like equation dynamic favor . second thing , last 20 year defined cloud crm . next 20 year defined ai crm . think actually leader ai crm ? right , 's microsoft . -- 's product market , usage , adoption . two thing work really much favor create moment reason switch today . like stats show kind much adoption . shared last quarterly earnings . 63,000 organization already using copilot production . 75 % growth quarter-over-quarter . mean -- n't know number , 'm quite confident near top copilot adoption generative ai feature . reason adoption large 's market year . early gpt . great partnership openai others foundation model . we've included existing pricing skus . 's waitlist . 's gate . n't pay use copilot dynamic 365. use today . three thing really allowed u expand installed base . q - tyler radke - charles lamanna q - analyst - charles lamanna q - tyler radkeand go future ai crm , think 's -- 's thing we're going look . like n't really evaluate on-premise crm today . get like enterprise . want go get on-premise crm , thing cloud crm . going forward , people going consider ai crm . nothing else . reason , 's put existing license . anyway , think 's kind different trend happening , yes , definitely top mind customer . awesome . well , maybe last two minute , want get perspective -- yes . right . high cost running llm fairly widely known . extent , reﬂected pricing copilot oﬃce 365. talk little bit roadmap going forward ? would assume 're sort looking maximum cost moment 's one hardware vendor provide hardware . talk microsoft 's anticipation future cost llm go mainstream across microsoft 's platform ? yes , mean like -- first thing would say , 's going depend heavily business , like intensity usage . like , want run llm every e-mail get , 's high usage compared , say , running llm every sale call . going difference based product , much gpu usage use . second thing , one thing we've learned 've like , say , biz apps like n't always need use biggest model everything . one thing year ago , fine-tuned version gpt-3.5 power platform use basically natural language create workﬂows application . fine-tuned model , use something called lora , low rank adaptation , able run gpu skew a100 . think 're going see , 'll see proliferation model , work diverse set gpu skus kind get cost equation right . right biz apps , specifically kind live breathe , would say think work we've last couple year actually put u unique position offer lot llm low cost fine tuning , unique open ai partnership , work 've done application . -- yes , think would say , thing get faster , thing get cheaper , thing get eﬃcient . 's definitely trend last year half . - charles lamanna q - tyler radke - charles lamannayes . maybe last minute , talk audience key event product release expect second half year , know 's lot , three biggest priority heading next year ? yes , think got couple big event . think basically every month end year company , 'd say , 'll -- 'll shortage announcement capability . say kind like three big thing 're focused , copilot , copilot , copilot probably half truth . like 'd say majority , super majority feature work team form copilot related . even problem , would n't think copilot enabled , kind look still different , transformed improved take copilot lens . yes , gen ai indeed heart 're . yes , great . well , thanks much joining u thanks crowd . great . awesome . thank . thanks , everyone .
