'm mark murphy , software analyst jp morgan , great pleasure dave o'hara , evp cfo commercial division microsoft . dave , first , welcome thank much taking time . thank , mark . happy . anytime anybody offer trip boston , 'm . yes . know recently ran boston marathon . . one crazier thing 've done , yes . question answer ( question answer ) great back . maybe could brieﬂy introduce describe team product oversee within role maybe size business u . q - mark murphy - dave o'hara q - mark murphy - dave o'harasure . 'm cfo commercial business , sometimes people ask , 's commercial business microsoft ? say everything consumer , sort easiest way define . 's name everyone familiar . 's oﬃce , window azure sql biz apps , commercial perspective . give take , 's sort $ 150 billion year . okay . around $ 150 billion . let 's begin topic generative ai co- pilot . , since last year , outspoken bull topic . we've bull microsoft 's leadership within category generative ai . actually referred openai investment potentially best money ever spent . 've noticed amy satya , saying they're committed leading ai platform wave . company 22 year , 'm interested , would describe level internal excitement magnitude opportunity microsoft try go lead ai era . sure . 's certainly hot topic customer partner investor . think urgency passion around topic high . lot people come ask u , think ai ? 're even sure they're asking yet . want know 's going world going company . customer talking -- company need get front ? would say , high sense excitement customer partner , high sense urgency inside microsoft . 's bit expanding circle . first made investment 2019 , relatively small group people involved , permeates everything microsoft everything 're working . 's big focus u , big focus customer , think 's really early really , really good sign interest demand . impressed topic , dave , product known github copilot . started noticing 18 month ago , would speak developer . would say , well , wrote code day long , 40 % 50 % code generated github copilot . math pretty staggering think bottleneck , term n't enough developer world . soon , 're going copilot security , 're going dynamic , 're going team word excel powerpoint . told preview product going blow people 's mind , people private preview . think 're going see greatest ai value creation among product ? yes . mean , blow mind always interpretive thing , think they're impressive . , watching developed -- q - mark murphy - dave o'hara q - mark murphyamazing thing speed developed . started openai , logical place start , reason make sense . oﬃce team got building copilot product , quickly came together quickly surface product much direct value add , impressive think certainly expectation , exceeded expectation . think ability tap openai benefit brings , make usable drive productivity increase . 's impressive speed move . think everything accelerating 's goal company stay -- leader stay leader -- , need keep moving really , really quickly . think would see urgency everything everything build . think term see value , think lot value something like bing 's search engine , really lot value something like oﬃce window modern work product see big productivity increase . definitely see speed . 're impressed . everyone also wondering microsoft planning monetize . know mentioned -- 'd talk microsoft 365 copilot monetization coming month . generally speaking , think pricing packaging ai kind stack ? sure . general level , 's really way think . one many product sold per-seat basis , work instance certain functionality people use day , every day , company would prefer pay per-seat . product consumption-driven , data example , maybe per-user construct make sense , maybe consumption model make sense . others might point ai service people go use , pay go , use , disappear , come back month later , use . think opportunity u company . per-user see show place , consumption show others others service demand . okay . 's pretty broad range . question tend get frequently investor upfront investment profile going look like ? first train large language model , right ? 're going bear cost actually operating embed product . - dave o'hara q - mark murphy - dave o'hara q - mark murphy - dave o'harashould think short-term longer-term , margin impact microsoft make investment ? yes . 's good question . think 's important folk remember successful building large language model operate large language model , need lot data center capacity . need footprint . n't know -- 'd say hyperscaler , help hyperscaler already footprint . , 's matter making sure machine capacity available inferencing training . 's obviously incremental cost . cheap , -- come right monetization model , think important thing cloud business , build data center footprint first . took long time . super expensive . we're 're adding capacity data center allows u serve llms.so think -- think mean margin opportunity probably come little quicker would otherwise cloud model . come quicker . probably little quicker , already data center footprint 're taking advantage exists . okay . 's encouraging hear . dave , moment ago , mentioned great speed microsoft moving direction . think weighing -- benefit first market moving quickly chatgpt copilot . opportunity gain leadership position , also risk moving quickly putting thing wild . could risk around bias , could risk around hallucination . try protect customer 's proprietary data well , right ? think weighing ? yes . mean , 's obviously important question , mark . 've thought leader since beginning unresponsible ai think managing ai . mean , sam altman -- gone record several time saying , hey , need regulated , come regulate u . think everybody going open mind need make sure guardrail think growing business . regard hallucination , et cetera , 're aware , want eliminate degree possible . 're focused . responsible ai perspective , making sure 're managing people 's data , making q - mark murphy - dave o'hara q - mark murphy - dave o'harasure 're abiding privacy regulation , making sure 're thing compliantly . super important . 's focus year . 's one thing seems like popped overnight , , started investing back 2019. think came responsible ai principle year ago 've , 've trying drive thought leadership responsible way , 'll keep . satya recently discussed belief ai going reshape pretty much every single software category . -- work , came across comment saying would next big battleground . maybe help u , look future , think existing ai-enabled product 've announced , think 're going see largest growth opportunity ? even beyond , going evaluate future opportunity building ai product ? well , think first -- sort answer reverse order , first area 'll go customer see value . work -- spend lot time , part commercial business , talking directly customer partner get sense really matter . 'll go build area really matter . also think company perspective , one first thing look total addressable market say , big could market get ? permission play , like make sense u 's really big market think deliver customer value , that's 're going go . think term think immediate ability monetize ? i'll go back think work 're productivity tool oﬃce modern work broadly , think 's going immediate value . also think , sort add , 's lot talk ai going eliminate job . think 'll automate lot function , free time worker go thing , even within finance team . automate function , free time finance team go work customer directly help understand . honestly would rather finance team working customer manual reporting something back end . think productivity gain . free people go work thing . point github , 's shortage developer . think expands capacity build better product . 's lot goodness come . yes . yes . especially oﬃce , potential get front could dream dream putting front 1 billion people pretty rapidly , right ? q - mark murphy - dave o'hara q - mark murphy - dave o'hara q - mark murphyyes . 'm bit hard impress , day oﬃce team came demo . 's like , hey , 's good stuff happened fast . really . right . let 's shift gear talk bit getting azure talk trend 've seen around optimization . 'll frame way , last microsoft partner survey , asking long expect see elevated level cloud optimization activity continue . came back said average something like four five quarter . 're basically saying customer trying le , right , environment . time frame strike ? bit pessimistic ? already chunk customer kind done optimization , right , would nearing end . yes . think 's natural say four quarter , sort -- optimization start lap . think optimization perspective , first , see optimization good thing -- 've never customer come say , need cut budget . 're like , hey , would like , 'm kind running budget . way optimize spend ? generally , right , optimization growth opportunity even cause little bit short-term compression . see optimization good thing . think 're going reprioritize keep spending budget cloud . 's going new area cloud . think say year , start lap , think per- customer basis , 's true . customer optimizing faster others . always going . okay . compression , also 's kind -- set table growth opportunity later . compression expansion time . expansion part , amy comment recent earnings call ai service would contribute one point azure 's growth current quarter , june quarter . course , run math . equates something like $ 500 million run rate . people pointed u , number azure openai customer increased 10x sequentially last quarter . combining extrapolate bit ? logical conclude ai service going become pretty meaningful boost azure growth we're looking , let 's say , 12 24 month ? word , could actually contributing 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 point growth truly moving needle azure ? - dave o'hara q - mark murphy - dave o'hara q - mark murphy - dave o'hara q - mark murphyyes . would say , mark . mean , early day cloud , talked , hey , maybe market could $ 10 billion $ 20 billion , 's obviously far exceeded . 've given trying predict 's going go . would say couple thing seem make sense . one cloud still lot growth left . think 'll continue see good , solid growth cloud business . two ai pretty new , nascent . would make sense ai grow faster cloud business . n't think -- mean , almost work parallel . without getting number , think 's going big growth opportunity u . think 's -- given size azure business growth ai , think make sense say ai meaningful part number point . okay . one question relates directly azure . started hear fieldwork company going fundamentally begin evaluate across hyperscaler platform , really increasingly based generative ai capability . given microsoft strong early leadership arena , see type halo effect developing maybe start see azure actually gaining share workload world may company saying , well , let 's start moving data azure , right , 're ready time come use best-of-breed ai capability . certainly get interest customer mark . get customer maybe n't talking call say , hey , would love talk ai . give u opportunity open door azure . since best ai service run best azure , think start conversation n't started . right , would say , 's reﬂected conversation we're customer conversation 're people necessarily cloud customer azure customer 're talking . manifest , term share , time tell , think big door opener u n't . 's promising trend . 's good trend . yes . okay . let 's switch gear bit talk oﬃce . estimate , approaching $ 50 billion revenue . massive business , even $ 150 billion 're responsible . o365 commercial bulk . - dave o'hara q - mark murphy - dave o'hara q - mark murphy - dave o'hara q - mark murphywhen drill , recently grew 18 % constant currency . view key ingredient broader phenomenon driving scale business level durable growth . azure . 're talking azure growth ? 'm sorry . , 'm talking -- meant say oﬃce . okay . oﬃce . yes . oﬃce business , mentioned one earlier meeting , remember sitting meeting long time ago oﬃce $ 10 billion business person running said , n't know keep growing . $ 10 billion . $ 10 billion , ago . think 've done really good job continuing deliver lot value . think 've seen increased functionality oﬃce people appreciate willing pay . primarily , historically come one three way . one seat growth , lot seat growth small medium business space , 's important space small medium business become big business . 've seen lot good seed growth . 've seen really good arpu growth , especially , recently e5 sku , security , high demand around telephony analytics piece . people willing pay u get additional functionality . 've seen seat growth , 've seen arpu growth . seen u break new market . think -- we've continued add value go . long convince customer spending money productivity tool , 'll save money elsewhere p & l , think 'll continue successful . onus u make pitch , make convincingly , show clearly 're going save bunch money . think 'll continue spend u . think growth opportunity , good runway growth opportunity move forward . want try drill , 're hinting algorithm , right ? growth algorithm oﬃce side . drilled 18 % growth oﬃce 365 , seat grew 11 % , arpu would driven something like six seven point top . mentioned arpu driver , right , e5 - dave o'hara q - mark murphy - dave o'hara q - mark murphya big one . pricing change . maybe 're going copilot uplift future learn pricing . see growth algorithm evolving oﬃce 365 ? think 're wondering we're going get point arpu driving little equation going forward . think depends value 're adding . think new functionality 're going come within copilot , think probably biggest value 've added long time . would n't go far say , yes , arpu going make bigger chunk . could see somebody could reach conclusion based functionality 're going ship . think 'll see good balance seat growth arpu growth based new functionality 're bringing . okay . let 's move ask moment security . , look microsoft partner survey run quarterly cadence , security actually usually ranking number one product microsoft product term momentum . partner actually reﬂecting u 's high level inbound interest security side . learned recently passed $ 20 billion revenue , grew 33 % . think 's best-kept secret microsoft . -- think scale growth trajectory , look around world many company want say want consolidate security provider . far ambition reach think differentiating microsoft security stack ? well , think right security perspective , 's growing business , 's always new threat new place people spend money security product really want protect enterprise . see market grow , honestly , forever , n't think security threat ever go away . think hacker trying new thing every day . think important u stay ahead product perspective . think thing cover breadth enterprise . point solution competitor provide point solution really good job , really good job area . think breadth solution , cover enterprise . that's value prop . think offer product way want part product , get . want breadth security offering , get . think ﬂexibility add lot value , . think market maybe others continue see growth long 's threat world , think security growing market . maybe others . - dave o'hara q - mark murphy - dave o'hara q - mark murphy - dave o'hara q - mark murphymaybe . never know . mean , like said , 've given predicting . yes . 's hard predict future n't even happened yet . yes . 's say . okay . want come back github sort pointing , think microsoft shrewd acquisition 's made year . pretty good example . comment recently github home 100 million developer exceeded $ 1 billion arr scale . think back five year , estimate time 30 million 35 million developer world . bridge gap , github expand market point 100 million developer ? yes . would remember day talking 3 million developer , 5 million developer , 10 million 30 million . think part what's happened 've redefined 's developer . , used somebody known sort hardcore coder wrote software . , think , github sort democratized mean developer product easy use much ﬂexibility . thing would say sort adjacent power apps strategy 've seen good traction power apps 's , , easy use easy build app . people previously n't considered developer , think see developer . 's helped expand category developer . 's -- 's sector , financial service great example decided need financial service company , need tech company . 've grown footprint developer . noted beginning , 's shortage developer degree copilot expand productivity single developer , think 's goodness . 're going run -- 're going -- always demand developer , least foreseeable future . anything increase productivity going help . think github got forefront . , thing -- 're sort middle , seems like showed 've working github copilot several year , feel like 's sort manifesting . - dave o'hara q - mark murphy - dave o'harayes . . , hearing 18 month ago 'm sure making difference . 'm sure developing . okay . , think said moment ago security may kind durable growth , perhaps else . team , 's product recently surpassed 300 million monthly active . still showing strength , even post- pandemic , 're continuing invest feature . coming pretty quickly team . 's team phone , 's team room , 's team premium . think evolution team product durability growth , especially post-pandemic hybrid type world ? yes . think 's -- think 'll good durable growth . mean , essentially , look communication anything go along communication opportunity team . started , wanted sort product people could use talk business-to-business , 's big consumer opportunity . 's lot opportunity expand functionality within business talk team room meeting . 's still lot done . think 's good , durable growth . also think product getting functional better every day . 's lot customer probably even n't exposed yet . lot good growth left think team product . hear lot good comment customer functionality , -- 's lot room grow . power platform . mention power platform moment ago context github discussion . product , addition security team , power platform , power apps , category . 's always ranking top three four term microsoft product momentum run partner survey . think back , dave , probably 20 year ago software company saying , 're going create product 's going create citizen developer . never really believed , right ? never really saw anything going break . feel like one . help u understand microsoft crack code ability get nontechnical user get hump , right , get creating app , people like u room ? yes . think 's thing came together well . one apps -- small apps easier build say , big app like crm . one prevalence introduction apps smaller functional pointed . two , focus lot ease-of-use . really get people felt comfortable using . felt like 's applicable . three get pricing packaging right , worked hard . q - mark murphy - dave o'haraso 's sort three come together . like n't -- still writing big long software package , power apps would n't applicability , micro apps make applicable . made easy use . think we've priced right . saw customer start give 6 , 10 , 20 user pretty quickly 're like would cost license everybody company . went viral sort pretty good rate . would n't -- n't know , maybe probably faster expected . think 's three thing come together , else probably would n't taken much . 're , . dave , ca n't thank enough taking time u today . mean world u , 's incredibly helpful hear great success 're . thanks .
