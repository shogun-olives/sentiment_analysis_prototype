okay . think 're live . keith bachman bmo . thrilled microsoft , mike spencer 's joined u today . may participate already one-on-one group session , formal fireside chat . , mike , thanks much agreeing participate . yeah . question answer 'm going -- 'm going jump mostly vertical industry business unit specific question , wanted ask one question come industry level jump business unit segment , edge . microsoft think first talk intelligent edge , company like frankly fortinet jumped little bit . n't give u backdrop talk intelligent edge ? really mean architectural perspective think benefit microsoft threatens microsoft ? yeah , 's great question , keith . thanks . thanks . would say , edge 've heard satya amy past several year , highlighted satya talking , gosh , going probably three year . constantly refer intelligent edge intelligent cloud . satya really mean brings phrase notion we're moving world believe thing cloud-based , interaction database customer service structure company operates , et cetera , computing interaction q - keith bachman - michael spencergoing pushed edge . historically , would running server via web , 's moving mobile device , 's moving thermostat house , 's moving center manufacturing line , moving device like hololens allows remote oversight technical standpoint . compute get pushed edge , 's going actually result several thing . one , 's distributed architecture compute taking place 'll see continued shift time , folk going demand edge responsiveness . leaf thing like cosmos db , 's distributed database architecture replicates localized basis , 's closer edge , 's accessed . mean sensor edge-type device lead higher amount data collection , obviously whole set positive implication associated thing like machine learning artificial intelligence , et cetera , well compute hand . , think phone evolution phone . use -- basically run almost entire productivity stack directly phone day . obviously , 's always going role pc whatnot , 're going see architecture get distributed across refer intelligent edge . 'll see u focus customer really -- 's -- 's end business going operate future . serve reduction latency , ability push power edge harnessing data going critical move forward . okay , okay . okay . well , 's probably good segue pbv . 'm going go business unit business unit . one thing 've discussed last couple year small line item called oﬃce oﬃce 365 , particular . want jump past quarter , growth slowed pretty materially , oﬃce 365 commercial , 22 % year-over-year growth , constant currency , seat growth kind 15 % versus 20 % last -- 20 % percent last four quarter . , transactional part business . talk little bit happened quarter importantly runway see next 12 month opportunity set microsoft ? economy little bit tough think integrating economy question , talk little bit oﬃce 365 commercial , particular . yeah , sure . , give couple different angle look . first , let 's talk seat dynamic 's probably saw -- quote- unquote , slowdown part business . within seat slowdown , actually pretty direct driver obviously previous quarter , given moderate slowdown we've seen previous quarter . within quarter , number factor -- stuck 've seen previously . first foremost , introduction covid back march , actually launched trial , e1 trial really saw broad adoption , much stronger adoption anticipated . , number customer , especially lower tier customer opt trial , q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachmansome portion would purchaser past . , six- month trial . trial ended july 1st . , great job filling top funnel q4 . counted seat . 's job convert paid user . , 's first dynamic . second going smb . see , like saw transactional side on-premise side business , see transactional slowdown oﬃce 365 purchasing smb . , impacting factor . third first-line worker . , surprisingly , environment customer looking furloughed worker , maybe 've shuttered retail store example see enterprise customer slowing maybe coverage first-line worker , case , lower first-line worker previously . 's much new seat statement existing seat turning , something factor seat quarter . said , near-term covid-related , ﬂush normalize move forward . 's baked guidance q1 . importantly arpu remains strong , variance revenue growth 22 % called seat growth 15 % give roughly 7 % growth arpu , implied arpu , , pretty consistent previous quarter . spread last four quarter 7 % 9 % range . , 're super-pleased big driver 've continuing monitor closely see good momentum market continued upsell e3 e3 , folk coming equation , also e5 upsell starting take hold . called q3 march quarter saw momentum continue q4 become material factor move forward well . , general , think expectation move forward , expect continued seat growth , although continued moderation like seeing , importantly arpu start become bigger mix equation . feel good momentum . , formula intact . we're going see dimension change little bit . , get arpu , seat growth , thesis economic condition improve seat growth improves , given current economic environment , seat growth probably remains mid-teens ? thinking wrong calibration ? think 's relatively right ballpark . thing would tell , obviously , n't guide specific number growth , biggest factor called , number one factor trial dynamic . - michael spencer q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachman - michael spenceryeah . obviously , 's gone ended trial july 1st . exactly . could kind remove factor table , think smb dimension 're seeing well -- around first-line worker , trend broader environment . , would n't expect change . okay . okay . well , let 's shift mix second . way think , there's two different dimension . one within oﬃce 365. two e3 two e5 . 's one dimension . 's also microsoft 365 , another pull . maybe remind difference oﬃce 365 microsoft 365 , let 's talk arpu opportunity . talked seven point , -- sound like remains kind way think model next 12 month , maybe talk two aspect , oﬃce 365 microsoft 365. yeah . , definition standpoint -- would encourage folk n't -- sku map available website oﬃce 365 microsoft 365 , lay pretty clearly . short , way think , oﬃce 365 going core workload everyone think grown know love . , e1 , exchange online base , e3 , suite oﬃce , e5 , brings telephony security thing like . move across stack microsoft 365 , two component added window em . em enterprise mobility security suite . 's e3 premium version e5 . em around . , stickiness go-to-market mature attached oﬃce 365. window newest equation , relatively newest equation . window e3 give window enterprise . , think commercial customer go buy pc want put window enterprise machine . 'll buy window pro machine department upgrade window enterprise , give overlay control structure associated window . , move stack window e5 , brings security layer threat protection window . , 're right , 's kind two vector think . 's vertically stack within oﬃce 365 , e1 , e3 e5 , 's horizontal vertical , across stack microsoft 365 e3 microsoft 365 e5 . q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachman - michael spenceri would tell two different thing 're seeing market . one environment , team security really pushed momentum we're seeing e5 side thing . folk moving softphone associated cloud pbx team offering well security resonating maybe ever . 's lead dog e5 . environment , 's becoming forefront dialogue . second thing , would say , hero motion evolved . time , go back history , original hero motion e1 . , customer move exchange online still maintain oﬃce on-premise , evolved oﬃce 365 e3 today 's customer coming oﬃce 365 really going microsoft 365 e3 , 's really become hero motion . clarity purpose , 's important understand revenue associated window revenue associated em land respective unit . , window portion microsoft 365 land window commercial em land inside azure . 's saas portion azure . , 's important aspect understand . , see good momentum , surface arpu story within oﬃce 365 talked surface part dialogue versus broader horizontal play get microsoft 365. said penetration trade oﬃce 365 e3 versus e5 ? n't . last stat gave keith year back , said 60 % premium . could e3 , could e5 , could e1 plus oﬃce online . -- 've gotten lot feedback . , we're investigating might update stat , n't anything new share . okay . also offer bundle . buy e3 , also buy separately security bundle . right ? , specific skus . getting traction ? people environment moving saying , 're e5 , 's aggressive momentum , actually finding people buying individual skus ? yeah . 's great question . , journey 've e5 earlier , much standalone specific sku . , think advanced threat protection solid seller , audio conferencing solid seller . , one-off specific workload . year change ago , 16 month ago , let 's call , 15 , 16 month ago , introduced security bundle compliance bundle , around $ 8 -- $ 8 $ 9 , ca n't remember exact price . -- intended capture value security structure compliance structure within e5 . started see good success . ( technical diﬃculty ) e5 , really believe two plus workload e5 . q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachmanand , n't quite tipping scale full suite sale . 's changed team really brought telephony forefront . , , telephony hunting along security compliance . , 're believer two three , 's enough tip overall scale . keep mind , number customer already believer power bi . tends little bit departmental sale broad coverage play , two tend coverage play . , 's really led success past six month talked last couple earnings call full e5 suite sale forefront versus standalone workload component . yeah . mean , one question often get microsoft monetize team . way think , heavy force gravity take e5 bundle . right way think ? . 's certainly direct way 'll monetize . what's important understand dimension -- 're seeing team usage couple fold . one , saw good early adoption audio conferencing , mentioned earlier , 're seeing remote environment customer wanting take advantage softphone within team . 's coming heel change made , 's year half ago , introduced kind 's called bring trunk . , enterprise customer , know , legacy relationship & t orange world . good deal usually pstn offering standpoint business . everyone know minute commoditized business . offer minute package folk add e5 , 's something going high-margin , lucrative business u . , 9 time 10 , enterprise customer base get better deal directly telco u minute . , notion bring trunk e5 offering take advantage cloud pbx softphone offering within e5 really 's pushed u forefront . 's going stop folk like ringcentral , example , 8x8 others , would offer softphone structure top broader minute package using public apis . see customer seeing viral effect team take place saying , wow , really take advantage , 'll take advantage softphone offering make fully encompassed best user experience get team , really led momentum . okay . yeah . team certainly getting lot traction , mentioned pre call bmo standardized team . , 're certainly pushing forward . staying within pbv , favorite actually dynamic . way -- comment i've made past still think microsoft underserved dynamic . reason draw conclusion 's , call , 3 % microsoft 's revenue 3 % market share market serve . , 's -- mind , 's good enough . right ? - michael spencerbecause 's microsoft . , think -- satya still brings lot conference call , dynamic become relevant ? 's great question , keith . appreciate . -- would say , couple thing could talk strategy d365 specifically . , dynamic business shown steady growth past couple year . passed $ 3 billion fy '20 . importantly , d365 majority revenue growing pretty healthy clip . last quarter , think 42 % something , almost 38 % , close 40 % growth . feel good momentum . core saas business , attached motion , , expansion motion beyond core saas offering spend time talking , 's natural path penetration inside enterprise space . would say couple thing think go-to-market strategy around d365 , given level excitement hear satya talk much biz app space . 're obviously crm online business . go pretty formidable opponent . 's got lot incumbency enterprise customer . share win . 's -- 're battle every single time go head- to-head . 're still really focused core growth aspect business . second thing though n't need land crm online socket able land broader d365 functional structure . meaning , surround competitor offering within customer finance operation , hr talent , marketing line business application start expand footprint dynamic 365 customer base . 's led success well . last piece -- 's growing way , customer look really push , quote-unquote , digital transformation . n't necessarily love term 's broad . customer look automate various line within structure . functional apps become super important . last piece power platform . specifically within , think power apps , power automate , rpa structure well power virtual agent , customer service automation , low code , code environment close d365 . 're super nascent market still , 's growing rapidly . 're seeing number smaller company pop-up arena . customer really start push envelope 're , quote-unquote , transforming , use term , 're seeing reliance non-developers able carry water , given shortage developer migrate workload public cloud . , we're super excited space , seen success customer like chevron . 's gone viral quickly . , see building block , land expand motion saas-based offering d365 feel like 've got tenant place 's execution serving customer . q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachman 's distribution sfa salesforce automation versus rest , hr accounting -- financial accounting rather , 's difference two broad bucket ? difference mix standpoint ? yeah . mix . exactly . yeah . n't disclosed , ca n't really give lot color . tell though two bucket versus power platform majority d365 . okay . compete say chevron , that's would thought category , forgetting sfa second , would thought mostly smb ? say -- sorry . maybe mixed apple orange . say compete , 're talking within functional application ? yeah . within application hr , f & , marketing , activity . would thought would mostly smb aligned . yeah . 're going -- well , 're going would say mid- market upper market 're going see usually they're based able integrate broader solution across function broader process across function . , 're really smb targeted . 're priced smb targeted really . , 's look , land expand motion surrounding somebody like crm going line business function automate process integrate crm structure . okay . maybe 'll end & come back second , we'll migrate ic segment . let 's talk azure . think little bit disappointment last quarter , although , industrial expectation shape - michael spenceraround , 's always interesting . maybe talk component growth azure want remind u , particularly dissect consumption-based model versus user-based model ? dynamic , lack better word , play helping u think growth potential ? sure . , hear heard feedback loud clear level anticipation , , azure . 've reminding folk came actually expected q4 . 're pleased . actually slightly fx headwind q4 originally guided . , factored little bit . general , component 've talking also intact business growth standpoint . , first , obviously , saas business continues moderate . see seat number provide . seat growth quarter 30 -- low 30 % -ish range . look sku price . mean , em e3 sku $ 9 , use enterprise discount . , encourage folk math p time sku look like . see piece business moderating . , material driver slowdown q4 . q4 always seasonal heavy period em standpoint . , surprise . , iaa paas side business , see thing , would say , q4 carry forward , peaked -- think peaked little bit q4 , obviously give implied guide q1 . , first foremost , saw -- see slowdown impacted industry come iaa paas , think hospitality travel , thing like . second thing see -- saw optimization within customer base might normally historically seen . optimization always core tenant customer migrate public cloud . one first step 'll take within workload move refining workload , find thing like reserved instance thing like . saw bit q4 . , expect continue 's easy way customer ensure 're getting bang dollar , , 're buying iaa pas . last piece , see ebb ﬂow customer case accelerating migration public cloud . case , looking prioritizing workload saying , hey , maybe moving erp system use example particular point might introduce little bit risk appetite given moving part . , little bit occurred q4 well . , within line expectation . keep mind provided guidance q4 , already end april . already , , point , six week kind covid dynamic . , thing largely played way expected . big thing q4 surprise , pleasant surprise , highlighted , n't show revenue q4 sale actually stronger anticipated . go back april dialogue , actually anticipated slowdown larger longer-term azure deal . expected customer maybe hold back little bit commitment . actually saw opposite . q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachman - michael spencerwe saw customer actually push harder . , larger longer-term commitment azure really showed see rpo came q4 , long-term rpo specifically higher growth rate short-term rpo . , 's important aspect keep mind think iaa paas equation . overall , customer commitment never wavered actually increased quarter , great sign . moving forward , keith , second half question . guide q4 implies kind mid -- lower mid growth percentage azure , depending want believe component . -- lot trend talk going consistent . , saas slowdown talked , optimization phase see , trend around impacted industry , et cetera , 's baked guidance . , feel pretty good momentum going forward continued growth , especially consumption side business . found helpful benchmark aws growth azure growth point time revenue track growth rate , , 's actually pretty good proxy obviously come frankly large number impact growth . , let 's talk little bit competition 're seeing aws perhaps google . seeing term , , workload ? word , natural workload migrate ? , b , pricing ? yeah . , great question . would say , largely macro level competitive landscape , whole lot changed . see aws everywhere . go head-to- head pretty much every deal . , obviously , gcp popped bit past month 've bit targeted . obviously , lever really go price 've seen . also tend see gcp aws go head-to-head bit kind heavier devops environment , think silicon valley startup type environment . , azure gcp compete devops ? try , 've really focused trying push , see aws gcp go head-to-head space u . would say , point though , around kind specific workload , would actually pivot bit bit industry-focused , talked little bit workload . , obviously , 've lot success area like retail good example . seen google actually talk retail space well versus think aws lot success 've seen 've called public acknowledgement extension legacy business growing extending future . speaks lead 've q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachman - michael spencermarket first gate . , 're seeing benefit carryover , would say , anything . look forward , 've vocal offering around thing like data service . super optimistic database offering lot going like cosmos db quantum computing offering within . think lot ai functionality really starting come fold . 've announced lot enhancement around thing like agriculture , oil gas , 're really focused development around , ai functionality . , 'll continue see . last piece , 've seen press little bit well . 've passed every security clearance needed go classified structure within u government . 's obviously led lot dialogue governmental space across geographic landscape . , 're optimistic . , moving forward sale standpoint , 've hyper-focused really putting technical solution , sale specialist well vertical solution sale specialist market . 're seeing come lot described . okay . mentioned government , want ask jedi contract , think 'll skip since 'm sure say . n't much say . guy read press like . satya last call said , azure cloud limitless data analytics . , trying highlight capability see area . 's message ? satya highlight something extent , 's reason . would think particular google data side analytics side , 's take lot pride extreme great capability . , think aggregate portfolio microsoft suggests competitive advantage data analytics azure ? yeah . mean , obviously , legacy database infrastructure offering sql feel good competitive landscape standpoint 's natural transition azure . , standpoint , feel good competitive positioning . right highlight gcp formidable area get market recognition . general , though , would say lot 're seeing data offering , especially around quantum offering within azure , going see push customer base really go large set data either locked on-premise process building aggregating . q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachmanright , circle back first question asked today , keith , around intelligent edge , amount data volume coming customer base larger anything 've ever experienced past , coming every way . think remote environment . amount data interaction point interfacing , either home road 're oﬃce growing exponentially . , satya talk limitless data , 's really talking ability customer harness insight power data actually provide able use advantage . , azure able help achieve really goal end day offering set . kind go across structure thing like azure arc , allows give visibility across entire portfolio , on-premise well cloud . data obviously core architecture . ability go utilize ai harness data core anything going success ai standpoint going data . , solve equation , everything else kind becomes second point , , really going limit unless go . , 's hearing satya leaning . okay . , microsoft talk also lot security , 's number different point . security part competitive advantage relates azure specifically broader n't really orient around azure ? well , mean , obviously core component azure . thing like azure sentinel , example , core offering 've super aggressive , security much broader play . 've vocal offering across security market 's kind several different aspect give . first , obviously , identity socket , u 's azure active directory , 's compete . 's going first core tenant . move thing like threat protection becomes super important , ability go folk like proofpoint , et cetera , detect manage endpoint , detect threat may coming sort angle , environment , point circling back intelligent edge , environment , 's super important aspect . third thing going -- going focus around cloud security . , like said earlier , azure sentinel , overall security cloud estate look like becomes critical aspect . last piece going around overall estate productivity side thing , security built existing application . , 've hyper-focused well . , general , would say , security broad play u . em lead security offering . talked saas side thing , 's also embedded azure offering well specific security service like azure sentinel . - michael spencer q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachman - michael spencerokay , okay . fair enough . let 's shift gear little bit commercial cloud gross margin . last quarter , think plus 1 66. amy , think , suggested gross margin continue expand , maybe pace slow , given mixed issue . walk one mixed issue 're liberty , next quarter , quarter thereafter , investor think commercial cloud gross margin ? yeah . great , question . would say , first foremost , basic , important , obviously , whenever 're looking number normalize useful life change , accounting change . yeah , yeah . 'm trying take -- yeah . , point -- question obviously take , broader audience , 's important make sure understand . second thing would say anomaly team usage q4 's important folk understand 've gotten number question around oﬃce 365 margin . 's important understand beauty network architecture usage increase specific product , 's kind half inﬂated tyre structure , azure benefit able , quote-unquote , allocate usage capacity team utilize , 's charged , obviously , team p & l oﬃce 365 p & l . , ebb ﬂow . 's question , commercial cloud gross margin best metric look . within , several factor . one , continue improve across saas service , although started reach steady state -- closer steady state incremental improvement business become smaller move forward . case 365 , quarter , actually quarter-on- quarter . , 's important understand . iaa paas though , importantly , continue make material improvement azure business , expect continue . overall mix shift towards iaa paas take place , 's going put additional downward pressure , , commercial cloud gross margin . , heard amy talk , expect continued improvement , moderated pace look forward . right . talking continued improvement , n't next quarter , longer-term opportunity , 67 whatever , longer term opportunity . yeah . q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachman - michael spencer okay . way , change depreciation schedule , 'd like -- excited one . yes . hear . maybe want jump & -- go back & . orientation le around consumer activity , tiktok , something 've talked year say application business application side , particular . -- area -- satya mentioned couple different time want nurture business , still something consideration , say , perhaps inorganic help help drive incremental business ? mean , obviously , ca n't comment anything specific . would say , broadly though 's single business inside microsoft , 's always evergreen constant dialogue around organic inorganic option help grow business strategy standpoint biz apps dynamic little different . , would n't -- would never say never , obviously piece . know , & standpoint , valuation one component important component look & . others even growing market , better owner ? good fit culturally ? check box valuation make sense , 're always exploring . , would never say anything table , obviously can't specific . okay . let 's shift mpc . excuse . 'm actually going jump gaming . console launch . thesis new console launch going probably n't huge catalyst stock revenue profile , given game going backwards compatible n't necessarily need upgrade . addition , game , halo may different time trend , think investor thinking console potential driver business within framework gaming ? follow-up . think look previous launch trend around console cycle u , think 's good benchmark . think 's two thing think come upcoming console launch . one folk -- 've seen good -- highlighted . current crisis , console sale actually stronger anything anticipated . , 're going enter console launch q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachman - michael spencercycle upcoming holiday period leaner inventory previous cycle . , help . keep mind , folk going upgrade , 's going kind two camp folk going upgrade . one folk want latest greatest , 's smaller portion audience . second folk still oﬃce -- xbox 360 versus moving xbox one . , 's still sizable number folk console . , going two primary driver . general , say one thing key dimension upcoming cycle momentum around game pas launch xcloud . yeah . next question . yeah . , 's going broader , would say , buzz , , market around launch xcloud momentum around game pas , really started take hold . talked 10 million subscriber back april cycle 're six month folk remote environment . , imagine momentum 've gotten . feel good dimension launching xcloud game pas mean overall gaming business . right , would say , keith , though , back original question percentage mix standpoint , console smaller mix ever . , 's -- think top line revenue , 's important dimension keep mind . yeah . going broaden follow-up question , hit . mean , seems like thesis around microsoft gaming revenue line item evolving . , 's narrative investor thinking go subscription , , n't want say annuity business , 's ongoing revenue source . 've struggled , double- digit grower next year ? obviously , quarter coming , 's going higher last quarter substantially higher . , 'm trying normalize investment thesis around microsoft 's gaming business look next two year ? yeah , 's perfect question . would actually point q4 symbolic hope business 're pushing business go . really great thing q4 performance gaming n't siloed hit theme . go back last couple year , obviously , fortnite spiky nature game . saw high . saw low . look back q2 last year , terrible q2 gaming fortnite comp . , saw q4 saw strength fortnite , actually saw couple third-party title come fold , balanced third-party dimension . first-party strength thing like minecraft title , like sea thief , game pas momentum . q - keith bachman - michael spencer q - keith bachmanand point , balance ecosystem solid foundation recurring revenue stream game pas moving forward help balance high low , well distribution first third party title , know , 've heavily investing first-party portfolio obviously mitigate moving forward , de-risk , , volatility hit party hit game dimension 've seen past . , that's really -- think business , 's goal . 's going , though , n't want make sound like going something 're going achieve near-term , 's going journey next year . yeah . , think 'll helpful kind smooth . well , 17 question ask , mike , think point , -- see clock upper right . , take opportunity thank time . wish best luck 'll look forward chatting soon . yeah . thank keith . appreciate . okay . cheer . good day , everyone .
