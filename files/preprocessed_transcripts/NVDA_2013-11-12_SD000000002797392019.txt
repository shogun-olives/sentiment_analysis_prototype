're looking forward bringing logan market coming year . okay . 's . question answer q - david wong - rob csongor q - david wong q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongor well thanks much , rob . one clarification . mentioned logan . -- said coming year . help u specific ? talking first quarter , second quarter ? order early ? well n't announced release date . show recently editors' day montreal . showed demo running six month ago highest-end gpu , titan . 's face demo may familiar , david . editor ' day showed demo running logan mobile chip . got lot buzz press . , 's obviously customer . look forward launching . n't launch date yet . well anyone question ? 've got lot people lot interest . webcast . , let 's use mic . thank . could -- n't know story closely . could tell approximately -- % revenue discretionary spending , i.e. , gaming , versus non-discretionary , would characterize auto perhaps thing ? 're asking opex ? revenue . oh , revenue . revenue . would say -- mean , last year , last year $ 4 billion revenue reported year , tegra last year $ 750 million . remainder gpus , split different business . year , tegra number le . reported le $ 300 million due one segment market , particular , window rt , performed n't happen way thought going happen . q - david wong - rob csongor q - david wong - rob csongor q - david wong - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongorbut 's -- last year , roughly revenue . coming year 'll see . expect tegra one larger growth driver next year . push , tesla professional graphic thing go work station non-consumer-type thing . give u rough percentage percentage , tesla plus professional ? yes . previous presentation . think put something august timeframe basically said market , least last year , roughly $ 800 million . little -- last year . little le quarter nvidia 's revenue . yes . 's also highest gross margin business , know . 's quadro tesla business pretty much top gross margin . effect console upgrade cycle pc gaming ? effect console gaming actually good . historically 's good . expect good time . console come , architecture console , know , frozen roughly year ago . time , course , cpu gpus evolve . time console come , 's -- would describe high- performance mid-range pc . 's performance optimization 's console . thing . , basically end bumping would call mid-range gpu product , happen lot volume . talk high-end product . sell $ 1,000 . 's volume gpu business . within $ 199 $ 249 price range . q - david wong q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongorand segment market benefit lot game developed console . question ? wondering , see best embedded opportunity tegra ? best embedded opportunity ? say `` embedded , '' 'm assuming 're talking -- 're talking tegra device ? -- well mean , like term -- like , look automotive segment . -- ? oh , okay . yes . 's -- recently -- earnings call , jen-hsun asked , 's biggest growth driver , see biggest growth driver next year . answer tegra . tegra side , see momentum android something -- nothing short phenomenal . android moving device market rate 've never seen kind operating system . everything micro-game console automobile display set-top box . whole different bunch device . within segment , 's lot device going require really good visual computing . problem visibility device n't clear . think car one exciting u . 's visible , least car announced , car like audi line bmw tesla s. using nvidia . 's lot type device lot us tegra within application . example , within automotive first application use nav q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - david wong q - unidentified participant - rob csongorsystem . rendered instrument cluster . collision detection , pedestrian detection , lot computer vision application coming . auto leading-edge stuff , older generation technology kind -- ? oh , 's -- , 's completely leading edge . 's research development . give idea , report released recently autonomous car . read first , look like science fiction kind stuff . already see lot application going car computer vision -- -- park car , 's overhead view car . 's , obviously , camera . 's camera side . 're using gpu create visual effect look like 're looking car . -- require lot visual computing . require low power . 's -- 's tegra used one big gpus . question ? talk little bit 's going shield day ? yes . shield gaming device android market . shield well . modest -- revenue modest . knew would like . 's 've tried understate expectation little bit revenue shield . read -- number one focus , first , build product really good . read review , review fabulous . knew would take time get shield hand developer , get really become familiar , get become familiar hardware , develop application really take advantage . discover market . get right partner get word . lot way reminds nvidia 's gpu effort early day . lot said actually similar early day getting geforce gaming platform pc . shield gaming platform android gaming market lot type effort . q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - david wong q - unidentified participant - rob csongorthis one 's kind weird , funky , hypothetical question , guess . know talking intel stuff , 've always said would n't sort competitor . 've little thing guy recently . stuff . n't really compete sort big performance gpu side . ever come , would guy interested ? would something -- ? mean foundry ? yes . oh , sure . sure , 'd love talk . 'd ask . mean , actually partner intel lot stuff . mean , notebook 've talking , use intel integrated graphic 're playing game . gpu using optimus technology 's zero turn . 's interesting relationship . partner thing compete others . far foundry go , yes , mean , 'd -- course 'd talk . final question , perhaps . talk size notebook gpu market ? also , talk china gpu market ? know attach rate china much higher rest world . view ? thanks . okay . yes , n't know -- n't know specifically break level granularity . let try answer question kind high level . notebook business , u , pretty good-sized business , would say , roughly half maybe little bit le desktop side . 's predominantly , point , mostly mainstream oem notebook , much low-margin . pointed , kind commentary business 's declining mainstream side , think q - david wong q - unidentified participant - rob csongoris surprise anybody . 's declining , think , rate 's better market decline notebook . , margin side revenue side offset emergence gaming notebook , like described . see lot notebook oems jumping . 're jumping make money segment appears growing . way , think notebook oems may exactly nvidia done . focus segment visual computing matter . deliver product market . pc gaming market clearly growing . think 're seeing . second question around china attach rate china . attach rate china , think , largest world u . -- attach rate china , think , last time checked , 80 . -- largest geo . largest business . 's one thing go see , whether 's icafes beijing , whether 's mall pc gaming market china . ironically , china , used synonymous making money software , become poster child make money gaming software . china , everything free . 's massively multi-player game , free play . -- get micro-transactions . want faster car , want better character , stuff . 's $ 1 . ironically 's -- , largest geo . last quick question . yes , , $ 3 billion . tegra 4i . talk opportunity design win . opportunity , maybe , vis-a-vis qualcomm , -- 's strategy try get design win . yes . 's good question . one thing announced quarter received voice data certification modem & . best way would articulate strategy tegra 4i articulate overall strategy tegra . tegra , , focused android . android includes phone . 's phone . believe 'll opportunity phone . strategy take modem market versus qualcomm . know mean ? look focus , focus always first visual computing . , within phone market , modem help use visual computing advantage versus people . q - david wong - rob csongorso think , , within tegra market , within phone market market , 're going look area visual computing matter . modem help u , case , within phone space . , course , device voice , phone one requires voice modem , device , believe long term , require data modem . , believe , extremely critical tegra . thanks much , rob . really appreciate . hi . thank , david . thank much .
