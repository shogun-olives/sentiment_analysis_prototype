good afternoon , everybody . 'm aaron rakers , hardware semiconductor analyst well fargo , extremely pleased host conference call -- knovio conference call , virtual meeting nvidia , manuvir da , head nvidia 's enterprise computing business , 'll get discussion . get , think simona jankowski ir team wanted read quick disclaimer forward-looking statement . yes . thank , aaron , hosting u . quick reminder , presentation contains forward-looking statement , investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business . perfect . good deal . , manuvir , thank joining u . lot delve nvidia company fire data center business , 's great opportunity speak key trend . -- maybe level enterprise computing , 's broad-based , 's increasingly diverse . think talked bluefield product past , maybe level set discussion , real quick overview responsibility within company , 'll go question . q - aaron rakers - manuvir dasyeah . thank much , aaron . behalf nvidia , 's pleasure . nvidia , operate one nvidia , one business . people ceo think owner particular business , right . peer report jensen , three different thing . one , 're responsible product . case , 'm responsible dgx , ﬂagship server ai , well egx , mainstream hardware built oem partner gpus . 'm responsible software side gpu accelerated data science software -- well new push enterprise- grade software ai 're making available enterprise customer sort middleware , ai . 's one way thinking role . second way serve , course , different customer segment , customer segment focus really enterprise customer , particular , 're work outside public cloud -- lot work public cloud . finally , perhaps importantly call , think different area nvidia 's strategy , part work jensen push democratize ai across enterprise company mean really move thousand enterprise company using ai today hundred thousand actually , right . 's really mission . question answer yeah . 's great overview exactly topic want hit . ai adoption , 's becoming clear move well beyond hype cycle , right . 's important driver business . 's underpinning productivity growth many instance across different vertical . think nvidia recently mentioned , think 25 -- 25,000 company using nvidia ai inferencing globally . think 's next -- next step enterprise adoption ? 'll go product thing 're involved really look democratize adoption rate . yeah . 's great question , aaron . clarify statement made 25,000 number using nvidia ai technology general training inference , right . use cloud , use building , right . think , aaron , think inﬂection point right , inﬂection point , okay . describe three different way . one way thinking success 've ai date company particular vertical clear use case related business 're . example , 'm online shopping site need recommend 's next thing somebody buy . 'm healthcare company 'm q - aaron rakersresearch drug discovery . specific use case , 've lot success , 'll see adoption continue . think inﬂection horizontal use case . , example , conversational ai way create chatbots customer service , n't matter industry company , long 're interacting customer , benefit ai-powered chatbot communicate customer . think 's first inﬂection moving vertical use case horizontal use case . 's one . think second inﬂection think ai journey company , training come first , inﬂuence come next training process hire data scientist researcher say , okay , take ai show produce model help business . work done , company get hardest step 'm willing put production use business , 's inference done . , fact , look across enterprise base , 'll find lot company today done training stage early inference actually putting production . think next year , think see dramatic change , ﬂood company get stage actually using ai production deploying inference . think 's second way thinking inﬂection . think third way thinking inﬂection perhaps little . today , talk enterprise company using ai , need understand ai . need learn ai , training inference . going forward , think 'll see company adopt ai transparent manner . mean , application use today vendor , right , maybe 's document editing platform like oﬃce 365 , 's erp system . vendor say , hey , 's new version thing , guess , 's infused ai 's better . great example , know , 're editing word today , start typing sentence suggest completion sentence , using ai . case , company 's adopting learn ai technology . they're deploying next version existing product infused ai . 's vendor learned ai worked nvidia adopt ai , rather end customer , right . 's really true marketization make easy everybody adopt . think three different way think journey forward enterprise ai . latter point , kind dovetail question . infusion ai application layer , necessarily say , hey , application layer going increasingly need parallel compute -- accelerated compute underneath ? , hey , application infused ai run general-purpose processor effectively historical application ? 'm kind curious -- know , sits ? - manuvir da q - aaron rakers - manuvir da q - aaron rakers - manuvir dasyeah . key phrase use effectively , yes , inference certainly run general-purpose server cpu , increasingly case effective way , term cost performance capability run inference gpus , training inference . believe server -- regular server data center gpus application running server infused ai , benefit significantly gpu server . 's different saying , graphic work built-in graphic cpu versus discrete gpu ? perhaps case , 's way effective gpu , right ? 's different application infused ai , already see benefit greatly gpu server . trend going get dramatic , aaron ai model used within application becoming larger larger complicated , 's gpu really make big difference . yeah . one question often come back nvidia , think last earnings call , jensen mentioned 10 % server deployed globally today , incorporated gpu . 'm going kind tie two question together . comment also made time , majority server could deploy gpu . talk enterprise , one , -- right . -- n't seem like traditional on-premise enterprise going big gpu attach rate . missing ? ai workload running cloud , run on-premise data center ? 'm -- -- guy see ? yeah . 's great question great one unpack . number one , absolutely case today look many server shipped , new server shipped going enterprise data center , server gpus single-digit percentage , right , case today , expect , change dramatically . reason way today general mental model need special kind server ai . server pack gill gpus . put four gpus , eight gpus server , 's bespoke thing . server cost $ 10,000 . 's server cost $ 100,000 $ 200,000 , q - aaron rakers - manuvir da q - aaron rakerslike ferrari . buy one , better running ai 24/7 , wasted money . 's general model 's penetration . shift working customer taking general-purpose server , server would put inside vmware farm , server would rack stack data center multipurpose server run sap , put database . take $ 10,000 server , put one gpu cost thousand dollar , 've got server one hand run traditional workload , 're using , regret 's modestly priced server , hand , also run accelerated workload like ai . 's multipurpose server , begin happen , expect drive significant shift percentage 's mainstream volume server begin ship gpus . jensen said , fully expect fullness time , become standard . look enough year , majority server gpus . gpus , journey , right . -- think fundamental point difference 're headed today , ai server gpus bespoke . 're putting corner data center . serve one purpose , whereas server working oems , along software 've built , multipurpose new workhouse data center . new server 're going rack stack every new footprint build footprint future-proof , reason workload run data center going require gpu 've infused ai need acceleration . yeah . , 's interesting point , right , think lot investor talk look point , eight gpus average term training , 's four maybe referencing . 're really talking somewhat elasticity bringing price point drive coupled application ecosystem evolving ai infusion . 's absolutely right , aaron . 's elasticity price point elasticity usage point . work vmware , right , already farm server administered via vmware shared different user different workload data center , ai taught another workload . data scientist thought another set user come access pool , team able expand pool naturally use case , right , that's work vmware . - manuvir da q - aaron rakers - manuvir dasso 've driven bunch question , add . 'm going kind try keep script little bit . involve , entail nvidia far full-stack strategy company ? responsible dgx , egx mentioned . evolve path environment elasticity start drive attach rate gpus ? want full -- full-stack provider type environment ecosystem ? yes , absolutely . want -- 'll careful answering question also n't want miscommunicate . yeah . nearly -- people done best work creating hyperscale multi- tenant compute environment public cloud , 've done fantastic job really changed computing quite significantly . deep partnership . work closely . case , providing hardware software incorporate cloud , right , provide multi-tenant hyperscale environment . said modern datacenter regardless whether 's enterprise data center colo cloud going look like , trying shared environment compute storage networking , used multiple application . 's industry evolved , nvidia committed provider full-stack , okay . mean hardware , networking , middleware software , operating system infrastructure , well ai software run top . absolutely working front . full-stack company . , platform company , mean , happy interact people level . acquire hardware build everything else top . 're going acquire middleware software ai software top . acquire ai software go , right . happy work level , certainly viewpoint full-stack look like . working full stack make available different way . example , announced program year working equinix , pre-deploying full-stack already customer equinix data center , choose consume . learn build . -- reason , aaron , 's important full-stack problem . accelerated computing easy . optimize different part stack together order get best benefit . 'll give small example . think ai produce model , model q - aaron rakers - manuvir da q - aaron rakers - manuvir dasbe large , split model actually inference . think hardware capability server , smart software split mark . isolation one without , 's 've done work together . yeah , 's great overview . touched little bit ai launched product equinix . thing 've done -- think tagline democratization ai , announced product , ai enterprise software suite . yes . help u appreciate ? 's -- believe 's subscription license , think democratizing ai ultimately , representing pretty attractive reportable soft [ ph ] revenue stream company ? yeah . 're excited nvidia ai enterprise . course , revenue stream foresee excited . think , 're excited mean enterprise company , right . 'd put way one barrier ai adoption today enterprise company , think start . first barrier , ai software complex diﬃcult create . huge ecosystem today start-ups provide piece , piece , et cetera , 's largely diy effort coble software together ai . reason created nvidia ai enterprise , said , nvidia actually built software . 've spent year building software . 've matured software . package together say enterprise company , procure piece business software , everything need . 's enterprise-grade . support sla . 's like window . 's like vmware vsphere . 's platform . 's operating system ai go deploy server data center . first point make easier adopt ai . second point think dilemma gap ai enterprise today , 's two persona . 's data scientist . data scientist research , creating new model , jupyter notebook , . every night , tweak data little bit , get better model , like model , right , one yesterday . hand , got . people control data center . importantly , people accountable software running production business depends . something happens software tomorrow , q - aaron rakers - manuvir daswhether 's compromised functioning , board want know happened , right , company 's reputation suffering . two distinct entity . early adoption ai , data scientist essentially worked around . 've either done work cloud built environment going forward . break gap somehow truly democratize ai . built nvidia ai enterprise way , said , 're enterprise business creating farm compute workload user , nvidia ai enterprise thing add farm compute farm ready ai . go data scientist researcher say , come ai work compute farm 'll able provide . 'll center excellence everybody come get resource , one place working together , take result work put production . 's work vmware , basically integrated nvidia ai enterprise vmware vsphere . admin familiar vmware today , say , okay , 'll create template different kind spin vms vm farm , easily create template say data scientist , jupyter notebook template . come use one 're good go . 's second reason . 'll give great example , aaron . know , 've -- nvidia enterprise available generally couple month general availability . obviously , 've initial traction success . one highlight without name meet economical example shift expecting saw . team . read nvidia enterprise . contacted u . got launchpad . experience setting ai environment . happy . set . went data science team said , look , set environment . come try tell u good enough ? brought data scientist , used , spun jupyter notebook , et cetera . said great . exactly want . team came back u procurement software . , loop , outside ai adoption . actually part . serving ai data scientist . 's kind expectation . yeah . remind real brieﬂy 's licensed ? yeah . chose license based way vmware license vsphere product 've done today based top vmware vsphere . 's licensing model , roughly speaking , 's $ 2,000 per year , per superior socket , okay , license model , -- familiar q - aaron rakers - manuvir da q - aaron rakers - manuvir daswith vmware say , actually look much like pricing vmware vsphere , 's also -- 's model way term support period sla . point view procurement , feel like natural extension . 's simple way thinking . 's $ 2,000 per cpu socket per year subscription basis . yeah . 's perfect . couple topic little bit time left , want touch , 've written lot . still feel like investor n't fully either understanding appreciative another layer acceleration , idea disaggregation , talked bluefield past . yeah . remind u , see bluefield data processing unit evolve ? might see inﬂection ? think tied project monterey vmware , importance think thing next couple quarter ? yeah . put way , right ? modern data center , discussed multi-tenant , right . multiple people workload sharing equipment . world , infrastructure becoming zero trust , mean ca n't put firewall outside let everybody party inside . every application , every user , every workload must thought adversary respect everything else 's running data center . turn order properly support zero-trust environment , need capability dpu . 's really feasible way -- tractable way implementing zero- trust environment amount information going across network process analyze , manage eﬃciently create secure environment requires capability actual processing networking interface . believe regardless whether 're public cloud colo , enterprise data center , trend clear , every server dpu order part secure zero-trust environment , right , 's keen dpu . 's 'll notice , aaron talk dpu bluefield , talk bluefield 2 , current bluefield . talk bluefield 2 bluefield 3 bluefield 4 journey . inﬂection whole industry going go . 's going take multiple generation hardware software journey occur . furthermore , going lot different player system , cyber security provider , virtualization platform provider , et cetera . q - aaron rakers - manuvir da q - aaron rakers - manuvir dasand took approach dpu took gpu created sdk . 's called doca . idea software developer different area one way program dpu take advantage , right , otherwise , 'd piece silicon one thing would n't really able support use case . think going convey believe dpu important think every server every server industry shifting multi-tenant environment . 's going expensive going forward siloed environment like footprint one thing 's footprint another thing , right . 's going expensive . 's going siloed . 's going inﬂexible , cloud shown . beautiful thing cloud one pool infrastructure used multiple way , 's winning proposition 's believe . think point , evolution disaggregation accelerated architecture isolation evolution , , roadmap , mentioned , bluefield 2 , bluefield 3 , bluefield 4 , eventually involves actually convergence gpu dpu together . -- think theoretically maybe inﬂection really driving , know , elasticity thing converge ? think may happens quicker ? yeah , think happens quicker . 's reﬂecting . 'll come back . think talked vmware project monterey , right . , way think inﬂection . happening vmware project monterey server dpu inside , lot work enforcing zero-trust security , et cetera , put onto dpu , actually server run multi-tenant fashion whereas cpu freed actually run workload . 's happened today functionality gone software run cpu workload need run . move dpu , free cpu importantly , dpu built way work much eﬃciently cpu , right , otherwise 're shifting problem . yeah . 're keen monterey , aaron , think 's 's going drive inﬂection . next stage , said , uniquely nvidia addition gpu ai capability dpu , take thing another q - aaron rakers - manuvir da q - aaron rakers - manuvir da q - aaron rakerslevel use ai understand happening network -- directly network , right , -- okay . necessarily convergence away gpu discrete component ? , , . yeah . okay , 's perfect . 's helpful . final -- two minute , know two minute probably way short talk . omniverse enterprise , think call 've probably nvidia recently metaverse play . responsibility , mean brief two- minute comment ? think , mentioned , 're interested providing enterprise-grade software enterprise company . offering omniverse . called omniverse enterprise . basically , [ ph ] general availability , 've seen great adoption , super excited really omniverse way people collaborate 're 3d design work . number people looking collaborate way massive . 's 40 million people need kind collaboration . 've created omniverse enterprise . simple licensing model based subscription . think term thousand dollar per person per year . detailed information , course , document , build simple math head opportunity . also working something called omniverse avatar enterprise company 's creator user , 's work company digital form within omniverse , journey opportunity , financially mean company , right . encouraging u , aaron , , worked many year produce omniverse . found year really pushed forward brought together newest enterprise , traction amazing . appetite thing quite amazing . 's another one thing , sit say theory conceptually , hypothesis everybody going need , 's going change every enterprise company . also say term traction 've seen far , certainly seems match hypothesis . see great appetite interest omniverse enterprise . yeah . - manuvir da q - aaron rakers - manuvir dasi keep going , think unfortunately time , manuvir . appreciate helping u understand story little bit better thank much . pleasure . behalf nvidia , thank much giving u opportunity discussion . perfect . great day . yeah , .
