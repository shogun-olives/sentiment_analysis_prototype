'll get started first lunchtime keynote amy hood , cfo microsoft . get started , lot safe harbor read , okay , microsoft . microsoft may make forward-looking statement presentation refer sec filing risk factor related business . true whether 're person listening web . morgan stanley , please note , important disclosure including personal holding disclosure morgan stanley disclosure appear morgan stanley public website www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures registration desk . way , amy , thank much joining u . thank . lot happening microsoft past year since 've talking stage . guess , biggest one addition linkedin . also lot subtle change like improved gross margin . walk u perspective biggest change 've seen microsoft past year excited going next year ? keith wei amy hoodit 's interesting , think , maybe perceive lot change , would probably describe 's accelerating bit vision 've team . strategy n't changed , ambition n't changed , goal n't changed , think , many way . thing 've seen probably bit aggression transformation make sure 're accelerating important phase . think confidence come acceleration . trying think -- satya , three year month . 's getting close four . , think stability excitement future confidence achieve 's probably would say . got . talk investor , area story spend time intelligent cloud . ( inaudible ) one fundamental debate time talking server tool versus azure . maybe start conversation , server product revenue really nice quarter last quarter , 7 % constant currency . think durability on-premise portion business longer-term . something could sustain next year , next three year ? 's interesting . know people tend focus component tree tend focus server product service number . many reason . number one number take temporal impact timing transition , annuity , annuity , crowd , on-prem , hybrid , different mechanism licensing . long-term goal quite clear , right , build hybrid server business , server service business 's primarily annuity based . number -- kpi server product service tends resonate cleaner . many customer many geos run server product time longer others various reason regulatory , geo-political et cetera . worrying pace transition thing spend lot time , frankly . spend lot time making sure capability -- customer hybrid customer . hybrid solution cloud solution could capable supporting company 's journey want go , journey want go . think 's probably better suited pleasing customer really tend focus . quarter , talked little bit fact sequel window launch , actually went little better thought happened . see on-prem kpi little better . long term important thing continue pivot annuity business long-term commitment customer platform product continue break new tam ground many cloud solution . keith wei amy hood keith wei amy hood keith wei got . think 's good segue sort second part question investor -- work went on-premise environment versus selling cloud environment , opportunity , monetization opportunity change microsoft ? going able make term broader monetization 're losing hugely high gross margin business on-premise ? 's think focus much dollar profit growth whether gross operating line , number one , 're right , said like-for-like , sold exact server standard sku somebody chose run cloud versus on-prem , 's clearly distinction cost would bear . 's actually 's happening . instead selling , sell 1.3 1.6 2 point number , multiple term new data need , new workload created , new opportunity compute insight . one- for-one substitution would clearly interesting 's world evolving . pace opportunity grows , pace expansion 's think sort every decade construct maybe , maybe longer . could remind framework percentage customer coming azure , percentage net new business versus visiting business transitioning ? 's hard say one one know file/print server used run on-prem run file/print workload . 's exactly math would work . way tend think looking say , hey , topline revenue growing double digit server product cloud business , margin getting better , know market growing , know 're taking share within overall tend feel pretty good opposed one-for-one like switch . got . competitive environment , 're talking sort global scale , public cloud , utility , , people talk , amazon web service google cloud computing , big vendor space . see competitive dynamic shifted past year , see evolving going forward basis ? amy hood keith wei amy hood keith wei amy hood think maybe distinction year later le three player , think , continue quite aggressive would expect . maybe people entered little bit later , think , ibm cloud get lot mention large customer , see press workload solution talked . probably allee incredibly successful across china large interesting market globally . often say 's three , although think would put clear leader camp , would actually global perspective probably even player three 've seen year later . got . 's interesting bring ibm think one differentiation often talk azure versus aws google actually guy install base , broad distribution channel like ibm , install base . advantage -- sort install base advantage , become invented past year people move net new environment , new workload thinking 're going hybrid environment longer term ? yes , think , distinction may fact twofold . number one , 've always hybrid start . run hybrid environment inside company , large customer beginning . , think sort 're built architecturally customer centricity perspective . thing install base , usually customer connection relationship , enterprise sale force , think , underappreciated transition really selling would think desktop-based workload , selling window version oﬃce selling really full infrastructure stack . ( inaudible ) transition capability , i'm really proud group 've done transition without really adding , 've added sale capability technical high end , re-training . new job fill . got . one last quick question 'll shift gear productivity business process . amazon recently lowered price , guy recently lowered price . thinking going forward basis , sort pricing dynamic going go-forward basis ? keith wei amy hood keith wei amy hoodit 's pricing dynamic many , many year -- point . think think 's competitive market . u tend want move stack term adding premium service . premium service growing faster core business u . part volume , part also obviously would impact price . n't see impact higher end 's differentiation maybe commitment analytics insight . , describe pricing dynamic something new would think temporal . think 'll see effort continue move people stack term capability . really running -- n't want business running , think , core storage compute . value , go chain . yes . got . shifting gear productivity business process . think biggest change obviously since last time 've spoken linkedin set overall business . investor looking see initial sort benefit bringing linkedin board linkedin part microsoft ecosystem ? think 'll start see -- earliest benefit probably co-selling , would call , business solution . may noticed satya's comment quarter really grouped linkedin along dynamic business term talk offer . 'll see , think , sale navigator product , one linkedin 's core product find added benefit dynamic sale force able sell well . think ability leverage 's sale force work good thing quite tangible term adding quota complicated change make term integration . next place 'll start see oﬃce term integration insight 'll able learn outlook experience 're running modern client . say modern client , mean oﬃce 365 proplus , call subscription form opposed pure client perpetual license . 'll see first integration come . pace quite encouraging . need , think 's month go technical roadmap , integration roadmap together . former head keith wei amy hood keith wei amy hood keith weissof engineering , kevin scott cto company , think great position term integration able product roadmap together . 's already made big impact enjoy meeting friday . think 'm pretty excited 's possible dynamic business . also broader oﬃce business well growing core -- mean business growing quickly . first thing -- fight club , said , first real fight club , 's sort n't mess . want keep core growing great job , team good . motivated . jeff great leader , inspiring around , yes , good . speaking n't mess , side equation substantial cost saving . think investor thought potential cost saving arising able run application backend saving distribution dynamic crm much distribution channel going forward basis . investor think timeframe achieving eﬃciencies little bit cautious -- assume 'm focused . okay . 'm focused growing top line revenue accelerating business potential , add customer , increase impact , grow faster , accelerate business , integration technical integration deliver customer value go well . smart thing term sharing quota . 'd call cost synergy , 's revenue generator . share accounting team , 'm sure , share accounting team . one internal audit team . smart thing happen 're pretty good type activity 'm deeply , deeply focused driving revenue growth . deal done cost saving . deal done drive topline . amy hood keith wei amy hood keith weissshifting gear oﬃce 365 , particularly oﬃce 365 , commercial side business . think last quarter 49 % constant currency growth . calculation , becoming one biggest driver gross profit dollar growth within overall business . 're trying understand sort fit broader sort path $ 20 billion commercial cloud guy talking . really two side equation , price quantity . come price , kind sku uplift ? tiering , e1 , e3 , e5 , far along path gone ? 's interesting . talked 're 60 % premium mix e-suite . 's interesting really talk e3 premium , even though 've got version something e4 like e5 like security analytics voice pstn conferencing higher sku 60 % , 've talked really primarily mix e1 e3 . arpu lift 've seen past three year primarily attributable first mix shift e3 sku . , 's lot room u continue move people even skew sack , also add standalone component like analytics actually done quite well , standalone book security component . move e3 well . think may -- chris might talking , need another metric , 's sort premium-premium . continue add tier . e3 probably wo n't seem quite premium continue add layer stack . color could give u term core functionality ( appointive oﬃce ) stack , analytics , security , something we're starting hear lot ? right would say term business decision maker cio analytics primarily security tend pool right upper e5 sku , 's top mind everybody . tends actually quite price competitive peer term value standalone basis buy sku giving optionality workload see fit . 's still pretty compelling bundle/seat . would probably say stack ranking security biggest pool currently , probably analytics . voice always going trailer , 's complex workload . 're le likely deploy sort across seat . tends something people opt-in branch deployment 've encouraged . obviously , run . 've encouraged large deployment . amy hood keith wei amy hoodand double clicking real quickly analytics , analytics something talked lot past 10 year microsoft seems like oﬃce 365 vehicle 's really starting sort enable distribution . , much better vehicle enabling distribution really sort product come market ( multiple speaker ) ? think 's lot thing . analytic solution required near phd operate long period time . kept seeing optimism around analytics , actually think solution still pretty complex term able bring type insight ease use 's similar excel . people still use number one insight tool analytic tool continues excel product . solution like power bi analytics inside , sequel database , looking field user integration perspective , like excel le like excel , think find broad-based coverage analytics type solution interesting people . key side p q term quantity , term base migration ? still , think give u sample along way . far along -- particularly get regulated industry like ( azek , morgan stanley ) , coming close sort coming board oﬃce 365 ? let take first question second regulated industry . first question , queue , guess , two year ago , seems like yesterday keith , analyst briefing , look install base chart , see mind . talked path 're install base exchange particular , talked oﬃce well . felt really good projection laid nearly two year ago 're today term install base growth penetration install base transition . component queue feel quite good . say 's queue coming , next queue opposed transition queue . next queue tends still coming small mid-sized customer segment , often people could n't afford capital expenditure upfront deploy solution . place actually adding , term odd , call deathless , worker . adding employee even large enterprise one one computing construct n't exist way term pc actually seeing decent coverage , especially non-oﬃce component suite exchange , sharepoint comp component . 's big queue overall driver install base transition think , 's gone actually pretty , pretty plan term would use maybe even little better hoped . keith wei amy hood keith wei amy hood keith wei amy hood got . regulated industry ( multiple speaker ) . oh , sorry . think interesting . 's little bit like cio survey guy . every year every six month ask people intent move cloud sort adamant 'll never . 'll nevers tend go every cio survey . tend think regulated industry 're seeing transition . level security insight , level 're seeing , actually geopolitics play interesting component regulated industry well . run different model . germany tenant based model , 've got different model china , run company called 21vianet , 've got owned operated data center well . meaningful component moving right-delated industry , would say , . tend view time series opposed 's one day everybody decide today day , tend move different workload time , n't know , remain hopeful sensor person -- working . guy working . got surface tab already , different division . term quantity question , piracy becoming part , oﬃce 365 helping winnow still -- ? interesting , get asked lot . think certain geos , 's never -- would n't say -- think , probably resonates funny . n't think oh , antipiracy product . think value put subscription paying feel like good value . think 've made progress front , specifically geos would expect . also frankly lot piracy . 's geo-based , many people pirate know frankly . lot small mid-size business particular tended piracy challenge think could think . 's language would normally use . certainly way think term paid smb growth could little bit proxy . keith wei amy hood keith wei amy hood perhaps licensing -- licensing would preferred term would use . last segment , personal computing , seen , think , lot investor , say n't focus . n't think area potential add anymore . said window oem business growing single digit past couple quarter lot 's come strength commercial side business . give u update linkedin cycle ? 's ability commercial cycle grow overall window oem business ? 'm happy asked window . seem get asked often . 're right . feel like people -- either 'm telling story well enough , take feedback nobody asks think 're right . time , people began focus big investment big growth return , frankly . set talking commercial cloud target think energy frankly externally . lot internal energy get goal . window really interesting . window 10 , launched free upgrade process primarily consumer , really encouraged many type feedback getting . importantly feedback getting commercial customer . security value prop management value prop window 10 clearly resonating number proof concept , number earlier deployment , number transition , would describe pull opposed push term customer demand . clearly feel inside enterprise , window 10. deployment encouraging , especially -- way would see tried change kpi summer similar . like -- oﬃce service product kpi , combination on-prem cloud , thing server one 's new one , window commercial product service , thing . basically take volume licensing component window , would prem add cloud component like advanced threat protection skus would hear u call believe window e5 make thing confusing . customer perspective 's easier name thing . thing go metric . metric growing , think , like 6 % last quarter . 's combination excitement around window 10 , security value prop , commitment , think , company making think keith wei amy hoodstarting see term oem commercial demand . 've seen , think , industry term shipment -- pc shipment n't -- commercial business tended around number . 're slightly higher right minute . trend pretty close commercial side . yes . 'm encouraged . understand sell window 're really selling modern desktop environment . modern desktop environment also allows u talk customer become modern oﬃce , upgraded recent solution . number one , many customer ; number two , upgrade deploy new window version , secure think 's allowed u sort expand dialog beyond , need new pc tpm chip , 's easier secure environment . component think starting see . want make sure talk capex balance sheet item well . think -- made comment last summer growth capex spending peak . help u understand sort comment come , utilization comment , build comment , term sort see end demand working ? 's definitely demand driven . mean , demand seems . 's far driven infrastructure improvement . mean , 's actually twofold talk eﬃciency improvement . one software continuing invest software side toward increasing much stuff fit unit thing . , spend lot time seeing much stuff jam unit . concept cheap unit , right , would say , 's also moore 's law construct . also happens standardize component tree across broad business . , certain instance , hardware price coming , everywhere , place , hardware price coming run workload everything search bing way high level ai azure skus able run consistent architecture , cost come way . 'm dual sourcing piece network equipment , right . think almost supply chain improvement sort simplistic way thinking . thing actually encouraging . 're geos think another aspect question . said , 're laying bunch concrete advance meeting . even though geo , still got lay concrete pad water cooling system need . 're building stuff advance . keith wei amy hoodso well , think people like oh , must everywhere world , n't done buying land done hauling -- away lot dirt , , 're . 's time . n't long lead term stand versus seeing demand curve , good thing . brings working capital issue . got . going sneak one open audience . probably second asked question get investor sustainability low opex growth . guy talking sort moving underperforming investment better performing investment quite time . still meat bone able ? always -- funny . get asked question often , 'm going cover form get asked . number one , solve zero . . solve zero , n't solve , n't think , frame use . that's best way get asked , 's like sit circular reference way zero , . solve inﬂation , , n't solve inﬂation , n't solve number . tell solve roi every single one $ 31 billion-ish operating expense fund . ask anybody microsoft could spend money , would say yes , , right . say , right , say , yes , got many terrific innovative , interesting , awesomely impactful idea ought get money . say love , love energy , right , come listen really fascinating argument , terrific , le terrific . energy grow hear . , job take dollar , every one . ask 're putting right place right time horizon . would call horizon zero , like right minute , right promo place , right sku pricing , right channel incentive , way horizon 3 , much like research-based work done msr , microsoft research facility . look academic pursuit many , deeply important . 's , think , made u leader technology like fpga putting data center . answer feel like drive topline revenue growth , feel like return actual roi dollar return invested capital , another dollar spend lot hurdle rate competency achieve . 're going spend -- never know number feel like 've looked every pillow cushion found nothing left find . right looked pillow couch , 's still penny move market change , right . always retrain team , move salesperson , geos sometimes n't healthier keith wei amy hood keith wei amy hoodor healthy . move salesperson , change incentive plan . ton mechanism use think 've grown far sophisticated . think always want keep mind never want world due opex 's short term dictate amount ambition would say ambition high . ability achieve really good . confidence spend money change environment look way . said , people would probably say 'm cheap 's okay . mean 's way cfo n't . become tough diﬃcult kind-hearted . like 65 % time . 's job , keep mind high bar . n't mean 'm solving zero . everybody 's squared away , mean would n't zero , mean solving zero . couple minute take question audience . ? okay , perfect . wanted ask question . ( inaudible ) pretty fast keith . exactly . think capital return , people ask durability capital return given take debt order . one favorite quote using long people give dollar 2 % , keep back 3 % dividend yield stock . interest rate coming interest rate overall coming . dynamic going durable time ? let say thing . proud aaa rating , 's thing solve . got back market rating dead . think 've always viewed return capital priority . 've returning excess free cash ﬂow far excess free cash ﬂow , gosh , couple year point . commitment made board level satya wish bring net cash balance company return shareholder buyback dividend , 've done 'm really proud . think great decision . think going forward , 'll continue see balanced view . accelerated pace get balance . still view important component along continuing invest continue invest capital growing business . n't -- 's interest rate driven way thinking per se . mean , even interest rate rise little bit , still room borrow make sense u 'll continue see constraint , mind , 's math equation . keith wei amy hood keith wei amy hood term sort political side equation , 's lot uncertainty around tax repatriation like . impact near-term decision making capital allocation . wait staff ( multiple speaker ) ? advocating structural tax reform many varied administration , would say . one , watch , see various proposal get discussed . get closer -- get closer get closer , 'll able tell would impact day . interim , 've company wait tax reform return capital , mean , 've seen . mean 've basically said made sense return capital , made sense buy back stock . borrowed , n't waited structural tax reform . 's reason wait board satya care deeply topic . 'm sure others , waiting could make sense , 's meaningful delta . u , capacity borrow plus ability invest , n't feel like wait able thing feel super passionate mainly continuing grow . way grow , n't feel like waiting administration , 's good tactic . excellent . well thank much , amy , joining u . 's great conversation . thank , keith . thanks , everybody .
