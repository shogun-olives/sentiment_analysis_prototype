good afternoon . thank joining u first scotiabank tech conference . really glad everybody . 're thrilled participation . 'm even thrilled stage . name steve sparkes , 'm ciso head enterprise infrastructure scotiabank . 'm joined today grannis . excellent , excellent , excellent individual around . get q & 've prepared , 'm going read mandatory safe harbor statement benefit everyone 's safety . statement mr. grannis may make today could considered forward-looking . fact , actually hope many . could considered forward-looking . statement involve number risk uncertainty . actual result could differ materially . please refer alphabet 's form 10-k , including risk factor section , 10-q . grannis steve sparkes q - steve sparkes - grannisany forward-looking statement mr. grannis make based assumption today . alphabet undertakes obligation update . end safe harbor statement . 'd like tell little bit , n't know . 've lucky enough interaction year . really , , thrilled 's today . 's chief technology oﬃcer google cloud , team tech exec engineer helping get cloud business . . almost nine year . almost nine year . early day cloud . u seen , google invested substantially cloud make powerhouse platform . big part . joining google , entrepreneur , tech exec number different sector . 's finance , although 's obviously particular sweet spot today , developer engineering leader , still , close tech -- ceo , director , past , graduated west point , jumped bunch plane , landed bunch people , lived tell tale . question answer today , 're going get hear little bit see thing developing . 'll kick little bit background role encompass cto cloud ? great . well , certainly honor . steve , great see . great excuse bump . role cloud , lead team . q - steve sparkes - grannisthere 's two thing . number one , top customer partner moving cloud . help navigate first step complex pattern adoption . -- around world , every geography , every part stack , way customer really interested optimizing infrastructure , way saas everything platform . example , three four year ago , customer asking u create natural language interface document . sound familiar based recent event ? period , course , year , worked customer take best research 're developing google product we're developing google helped realize potential technology . imagine working top customer across every industry every geography . also learned quite thing 're . second part take emerging pattern start testing . year , kind new product strategy , new entry road map based signal receive market , customer work . example work unilever around sustainable sourcing palm oil converted bigger push around sustainability google cloud , includes climate risk analytics . apis google produce data common , get massive access climate data simple api . two branch work . one best part job getting spend time customer see implementation real world 're really applied team . care making technology useful . -- 's fantastic degree customer engagement cto . scale team grown ? mean , 're running , , $ 30 billion run rate ? 's heck growth story . world grown support ? yes . well , think since q3 2019 , 've added roughly $ 24 billion annualized run rate . 's different business year ago . history , back roughly nine year ago , kind first wave cloud google , starting create pathway technology world . second wave , creating kind platform would allow industry customer , geo solve problem . 're really scale phase , 've got ecosystem rapidly growing , 100,000 partner ecosystem today . almost implementation ( inaudible ) regional technology partner ecosystem help last-mile implementation , planning , training rest . team , 's really looked like making sure customer getting leverage technology . guess , could kind break stack , want , -- cloud , kind think end-to-end platform . company , organization achieve goal digital transformation critical mission . start bottom , , kind think typical stack , technology-oriented , infrastructure . , today , 39 region globally . -- example , commitment 2030 operate entirely carbon-free energy , powering data center , 'll build . pretty much making sure access compute ubiquitous also sustainable energy consideration weigh people 's mind , sustainability weighs company 's mind . move stack little bit , second part kind differentiated cloud put really around data ai . see google 's legacy quite bit really showing . 're making data accessible useful supercritical cost . -- many customer want -- customer want -- want data make 's easily useful building experience customer refining process internally . n't want constrained choice single vendor . example , thing 've done year bigquery . anybody actually heard bigquery ? 's one hallmark technology . okay . great . saw handful technology conference . 's great see . bigquery 2020 , released capability called bigquery omni . bigquery omni allows -- sically co-locates computes binary inside cloud , like amazon , microsoft , allows send query across cloud want , without egress data , bring back bring result back . imagine important company data store multiple cloud . instead deal cost egress complex technical bit , 've solved product call bigquery omni . 's next layer stack , kind platform layer . q - steve sparkes - grannisthen move , 've got call security cloud . end-to-end comprehensive security , infrastructure security , also application security . brought ton new capability , one mandiant , round threat mitigation consulting . 've also virus total chronicle number capability year able characterize threat reduce threat surface across entire enterprise . kind moving towards top , collaboration cloud , want think like . infrastructure platform , infrastructure , data , ai security collaboration . get work done . create . workﬂows exist company . example sort like workspace . 's really interesting ai 've bringing market year , ai cascading . 's kind like thread run infrastructure , data , platform , way saas . think since -- minute , n't specifically hit generative ai , really must . yes . . yes , exactly . put least another couple dollar . think probably worth starting foundational . think -- think gen ai different vanilla ai , call ? let 's talk bit foundational benefit -- need place gen ai take . sure . let 's see . take ( inaudible ) generative ai ( inaudible ) okay . let 's try way . traditional ai -- 're going way . okay . right . traditional ai , 're really teaching machine look pattern 're using create like classifier predictor . includes work around neural network last 10 year lot classical application . think machine vision category . self-driving car , need teach machine understand traﬃc pattern obstacle look like n't come contact . generative ai . generative ai really ai system creating content , 're creating data similar data 's trained . example ask -- ask chat application today write poem . n't really understand -- guess people would argue , n't really understand artistic bit poultry , create content based similarity word 've used word used conjunction token , word broken token would comprise word poetry . q - steve sparkes - grannisso way , generative ai kind extension build foundation neural network creating content , thinking predicting next word , actually creating next word creating image . think one challenge u point begin hallucinate ? control sort error rate ? talked little bit morning 's keynote legal example , lawyer fell foul trusted chatgpt 's output despite saying , `` really telling truth ? '' course , lie . -- think one thing 're thinking business leader embrace power , time , control confidence 're make misstep ? well , opinion , experience really approaching full stack comprehensive approach . mean ? design principle behind google cloud 's approach ai offering complete ai stack . mean ? mean research go novel technique , mean processor , others semiconductor chip . design optimization , spend lot time . also spent lot time tooling . machine learning ops significant burden . gen ai ops , significant burden organization . also take upon create platform allows people , without even knowing code , start journey generative ai . also kind go top stack , like spoke . want give always-on collaborator . even 're operating saas , like 're workspace , 're like , know , like 're small business . maybe started dog walking business . 's still time f 's aspiration . good news generative ai help . express desire like , `` hi , really want track client , n't know get started . '' give call duet ai , 's always-on ai collaborator . give duet ai intent , generate tracking spreadsheet typical column typical field . 're trying run dog-walking business , example , without think structural component get started . many way , top stack , 's getting started getting value without architect . also brought duet ai platform . example , let 's say , 're using bigquery , hope . 're , 's still time . bigquery , really matter matter analytics system structuring good query . want run right amount data . n't want query that's well structured . kind overshoot data , 's costly kind run without bound . duet ai gcp , example , google cloud platform , capability within bigquery give recommended query question . throughout stack company looking get started , one , 's kind marrying strategy able find place stack . want build foundational model , care lot like , example , google , care lot ability tune infrastructure give optionality like tpu v5e , anthropic published week , 're using ten thousand chip cluster . care lot eﬃciency 're going speed market , also n't want break bank . could also looking gpus , host nvidia , range . even published -- made available a3 supercomputer machine shape , get ten thousand nvida h100s available run extensive workload imagine . 're model-building company , 're organization really want innovate , need infrastructure optionality , need partner really understands deep optimization infrastructure layer . maybe 're company 's like , `` know , 're going take foundational model exist , 're going take data . 're going combine create competitive advantage . '' 's need platform tier . call vertex . google cloud , vertex allows , without even code , n't need know code . go console . find latest model , whether 's one google find llama two . find model cohere , antrophic , others , model garden , get started combining foundation model data . well , 're like , well , get data going ? well , technology within vertex allows point indexer structured unstructured data . , code , 're pointing data source , index . , imagine , work , regardless background room , know produce content produce insight , also gather knowledge , structure way . actually one key barrier using data refine foundational model structuring , whether 're going bring like q - steve sparkes - grannis q - steve sparkes - grannisembedding , like spatial relationship data . 're going use knowledge graph . getting point quickly really , really important , provide vertex . mentioned earlier , like want see stuff 're really sure kick tire yet , 's use duet ai get immediate value generative ai speeding workﬂow , getting image presentation . many people room make presentation ? n't raise hand , 're lying . 's right . make presentation , one key thing workﬂow ? like let 's say 're trying convey concept illustration image . well , go find perfect one . n't exist , actually slows considerably workﬂow creating content . also concept online marketer , right , want go put content need image specific appropriate copyright right legal right . way , 's really speeding kind -- workﬂow . 's company get started like picking strategy picking spot stack . yes . think mentioned access vast amount compute , , obviously , prerequisite model generation . think 's one weird thing moment , , past , 'd see startup emerging challenging incumbent . case , incumbent , actually , access raw material , whether 's data compute . 's really model garden route probably way see startup emerging . 'm wondering -- think making available capacity emergent company ? feel like 's significant barrier entry moment . well , 's really interesting 're seeing traditional enterprise organization startup succeed generative ai . 'll give kind view path , somebody like deutsche bank . 's small european competitor yes . know , wanted point -- q - steve sparkes - grannis n't heard . yes . able synthesize internal content . mentioned , ? document . content . analyst . know-how inside organization . n't really quick way express question idea natural language interface corpus data document , get reasonable result back quickly enough spend time refining . -- past , probably would faster human go cascade bunch search , like write stuff put content . , pace speed platform like vertex allows index create spatial relationship representation data fast enough , workﬂow analyst reviewing content internally 's produced , 're using synthesize potentially new analysis customer . health care , another kind big traditional enterprise . many 've dealt health care system , kind classic enterprise issue around innovation . company like hca healthcare using generative ai . 're live transcription doctor n't go back desk type note . get live 're patient spend time care . traditional organization getting benefit speech text natural language capability generative ai today . startup perspective , experience startup founder , ceo also kind big company person well , startup , usually , 're seeded people really , really specific knowledge specific problem , advantage speed . lot 're seeing right startup success , mentioned anthropic earlier , cohere , ai21 lab , lot organization , get scaled ai optimized compute u focus solving business problem idea . like someone want put chatbot view like responsible chatbot alternative focus guardrail want put . output look like want generate , going get -- basically , ai supercomputer . take care . lot way , 're speeding startup 's ability get first article , first output , tune much , much faster . q - steve sparkes - grannis q - steve sparkes point exposing generative ai content consumer , one thing 've super thoughtful scotia , one colleague , grace lee , lead data analytics team , spent ton time data ethic program . 're acutely sensitive appropriate treatment form data , particular , consumer data . 've got human loop gen ai program use case moment , 've got bright line yet crossed exposing generative ai content consumer base . 'm wondering , across broader client base serve , 're seeing risk appetite check balance client may putting place make sure end user n't befall worst characteristic gen ai ? well , responsible ai something , opinion , associated google way . 2017 , put first version ai principle using ai production scale year . way , bumped lot issue early developing guidance hope , constantly evolving , hope helpful organization size . we're product people , 're technology people , 're engineer . technologist , 'm always thinking customer get leverage knowledge experience . example , mentioned vertex 's ai platform . -- one capability vertex includes responsible ai filter get added run generative model inside platform , actually give customer preview potential brand , toxicity , issue might come output send next stage workﬂow . may sound like little thing , create filter ability create kind sliding scale organization decide , decide much want push boundary brand safety within industry , competitiveness , type content want allow n't . even getting place codify , slider bar , set really , really important . keep embedding responsible ai platform customer benefit kind automation tooling way 's scale versus consistently human overlooking every single thing 're . point , need leverage technology . yes . one thing 've finding 's great augmentation task . talked earlier opportunity transcription rapid digesting data . 're really seeing displacement actual role entirety . think -- see side kick , - grannisaid , intelligent partner people 's -- knowledge worker ' activity day-to- day . absolutely . 're era -- 've building data product , data- centered product , ai-centered product . undergrad linear algebra , never cool . feel like 'm back . like -- winter . 's cool . 's really interesting accessibility advanced capability created layer stack . mean computation . one reason neural network took prominently roughly 8 , 9 , 10 year ago computational eﬃciency place could reasonably start run network scale . created kind first wave . 're second wave , generative ai kind made ai accessible . n't matter 're , 're business , 're finance , 're part company , get benefit ai convert kind natural language way interfacing , rationalizing world computer language machine language . pretty profound . think duet ai . tell 're trying accomplish surface spreadsheet creating slide presentation even within operation application cloud , help guide eﬃcient query . hi , maybe 're using wrong size disc . based io property application , maybe 've overspent maybe ought look different shape 're really accessing data often . maybe look archival storage versus running kind hot , high- performance storage time . little thing start really add . working one customer gaming industry , really interested concept digital concierge . meeting leadership team , really fascinating used presentation like ceo cto cio would go give presentation like 's stuff everybody would like , wow , seems like really weird . 's lot math lot computer lot network lot stuff , 's really relevant lot kind like day-to-day experience building lot business trying . one thing generative ai done kind broken silo function allowed people participate creation digital concierge creation experience customer . guess one experience ai really eye opener working nasa . 're like , `` hi , intern , 'd like intern productive summer. `` 're like cool , okay . ? literally like sleep ﬂoor run job they're q - steve sparkes - grannis q - steve sparkes - grannis q - steve sparkes - grannislooking planet , 're looking explants , particular group . they're like sleep ﬂoor machine job , run , may stall , n't work , time . 's really sad intern . providing hosted notebook small gpu attached orchestrated kubernetes cloud could kind like scale scale , discovered whole bunch exo planet without sleep ﬂoor , oﬃce , happier intern , scientific discovery , groundbreaking new discovery science , providing kind simple platform ai . mean 's era 're right . right . well , 'm going bring back something 's immediate concern use ai look security hole ? see arm race threat actor using ai find hole defender plug ? okay . let 's see . 're domain area . little bit . right , big cecl . 'm going try best . need help . statement , never made . okay . think 's -- , like $ 10.5 trillion kind cyber crime 2035-ish annualized basis ? yes , really big deal . least , 're , try helpful moment . 've talking , one , making sure 's comprehensive security application program customer entrust google cloud . example , security command center integrates lot telemetry coming . used kind -- would know extremely well , steve . kind application deal security different part stack . like endpoint security , application security , network security . one thing 've done google cloud deployed thing called security command center , 's kind wrapper give telemetry every layer stack , application way q - steve sparkesinfrastructure . 's really important threat actor capable , 're constantly changing tactic . telemetry data log actually super important tool evolve . foundation data really important , 're creating lot telemetry . even importantly , opinion , gaining u leverage we've created domain-specific model like sec-palm 2 , take expertise google threat group , take telemetry log event . 're pretty -- 's surprise , 're pretty big target well cyber event . take know-how , take data train foundational model , case , palm 2 , pathway language model 2 , kind bring security angle , combine data . sec-palm two model that's available customer google cloud . bring -- 's already kind tuned domain . use observation , telemetry data refine create even new capability within organization , may even differentiated firm level , entirely new form leverage . definitely focused cybersecurity . mentioned 's one foundational layer stack google cloud . mandiant addition , really , threat action gave u insight . anybody deal -- 're allowed raise hand , steve . anybody deal malware detection threat job ? yes , may know 's yara kind framework language around malware identification threat detection . like new programming line . 's like different language completely . one thing inside security console 've used sec-palm two create auto-generated summary malware event threat mitigation remediation natural language . n't cybersecurity professional understand semantics nuance yara actually get started threat understanding threat remediation . mean ? mean 're leveling security capability organization , tooling people . opinion , biggest risk lack cybersecurity skill available , advanced cybersecurity skill available . 're going need leverage tool platform . 're going need entry-level folk capability without 10 15 year threat-hunting experience would typically need operate level . even auto-generated summary quickly orient people remediation . could save , real workﬂow term , mean , could save hour , day , week , threat curation next . right . hour , day week really count rate exploit accelerating constantly . time shave detection remediation - grannis q - steve sparkescycle incredibly valuable . past , might try use simulation follow conventional learning methodology . able address lower level stack absolutely value add , sure . one threat 're -- one opportunity threat we're interested welcome opinion use gen ai co-development platform . 've seen , talking mike earlier , -- acceleration commit time impressive . n't want quote number case 's sensitive , 's certainly double digit percentage acceleration time release code . conversely , risk inappropriate code injected process something else 're concerned . wonder , firstly , extent -- within team using augmented development technique ? secondly , protecting risk ? code completion , code generation , understanding providence certain code bit , foundational 've working year google . show couple different way . one partner like replan , one successful ides , integrated development environment developer , ten million developer right . 're using model underneath hood help developer cogeneration code completion really , really speeding thing . even within -- let 's say , 're gcp environment using development environment , duet come back play . mentioned earlier example around workspace like slide sheet , also -- duet help code understanding , addition completion generation , , 've ever developer showed organization told , `` hi . go check code base tell mean , '' felt significant amount panic pain immediately . 're trying find intent design principle code intended actually take really long time . one capability 're really excited duet , kind underpins u , understanding code summarizing code trying . nexstar annual conference , showed example duet able create summary code intended also able look case like risky dependency , outdated framework , thing also kind help refactoring . yes . former programmer , recovered , say amplify will's thought pity poor people read code try figure , 's long time ago . let 's go back little bit earlier . talked capability omni -- bigquery omni across multi-cloud . think multi-cloud obviously -- 's thing evaluating embracing . - grannis q - steve sparkesso common lot organization , 've got hybrid environment , 've got bunch compute still data still on-prem . 've got footprint data compute multiple cloud . maybe spend moment thinking bigquery omni example 's , would n't say collaboration co-opetition , 's opportunity horizontal capability extend across multiple cloud ? thinking taking best advantage beyond omni ? think spend lot time customer job , role coming google enterprise large organization , like startup . find problem , go try solve , 'd realize scale , inside large organization . always start 's business problem 're trying solve really dictate view multi-cloud organization . example , disaster recovery , continuity operation . 's one form potential multi-cloud . may decide 's best interest want run -- want data store across multiple cloud meet regulatory requirement coop dr purpose . may also decide bunch data different cloud even laptop data center , may decide want optionality maybe converge one big data lake data ocean data universe . n't know 's next . something like alloy db omni , released earlier year , postgresql database , run laptop , run data center , run cloud , run across people 's cloud . 's continuation thread , want consistency implementation architecture , n't want -- right time make choice constrain number cloud hybrid even laptop . tool 're making available database analytical tool run across different service without commit convergence event . way think , want -- business problem 're trying solve drive think multi-cloud seeking solution match business imperative rather saying multi-cloud tenant onto try project solution . yes . think 's really interesting look -- shoot lowest common denominator , find -- really terrific company multi support -- particular , security operation line , thinking concourse lab operate across multiple cloud . see 's clear distinction company deliberately aimed multi-cloud outset support capability versus sort incubated one grudgingly accepted - grannis q - steve sparkes - grannispeople going multiple cloud , obliged support multiple different platform . -- well , choice , , technologist , want solve problem quickly possible least friction . thread actually run . mean , rewind clock eight nine year google cloud 's history , see earliest beginning surfacing tensor flow open source framework machine learning . see kubernetes container orchestration . see omni version data analytics data store . see across apogee , multi-cloud api management capability . mean , consistent drumbeat demonstration principle open giving choice even extended generative ai era pick model , pick workﬂow , right ? pick data store want bring model safely environment without expose . continuous drumbeat choice core dna google google cloud . yes . partnership engagement model one think keen , double-click , even slightly . group that's dedicated figuring drive partnership ? bring ? -- selection criterion use ? little bit . probably biggest -- mentioned 's kind three wave business kind making sure engineering primitive , making sure could serve every geo every customer breadth platform . 're scale phase making sure like scale customer scale without roadblock . ecosystem grown considerably . mean 100 -- said early . ca n't say actually -- 's pretty big change . 100,000 partner ecosystem google cloud . range independent software vendor use capability kind -- ride channel software deployment like workday sap docusign . 's also consulting company integrator help solve problem . company already relationship organization . trust built year , want continue leverage preferred partner . 've made available . deloitte accenture , wipro , thousand , ten thousand trained individual google q - steve sparkes - granniscloud , ready help solve problem deep implementation problem , maybe want -- 're looking maybe mainframe modernization looking problem typically complex . 're multiyear . involve integrator . involve potentially cloud provider . involve on-prem . type situation work 're capable moving quickly . kind continue kind up-leveling entire industry , 've also spent enormous amount time training . 100,000 machine learning course world sponsored brought world google google cloud hundred thousand practitioner kind world understand ai , machine learning google cloud . think 's real business benefit organization scale , right ? implementation complex , need happen period -- 's longer period time . really deep understanding business , industry , geography , nuance regulatory concern rest . launched like sovereign cloud europe . launched partnership two large partner help u kind manage behalf country operate . yes . one thing 've fascinated see phil venables built ciso practice within google cloud . 've known phil long time , weighing back goldman day morgan stanley , goldman , 're always healthy competitive tension , cyber arena , always cooperation . built risk practice ultimately became ciso google cloud . 'm curious much time spend hearing threat 'd like build capability defend vice versa ? go knock door say , `` hi , 's something ought taking advantage . '' well , like imagine organization , relationship cto ciso grown close google google cloud year . go back something like sec-palm 2. creating domain-specific model union domain expertise knowledge telemetry someone like phil would dealing day-to-day basis complex policy get embedded response guidance model might give content might generate . also like technical underpinnings platform infrastructure computation make feasible operate , creating duet ai capability inside security console summarize threat come , near real time actually computationally complex intensive process . phil n't want sweat technical infrastructure , q - steve sparkes - grannisand would poor job describing detail nuance security concern role . yes . awesome . 'm curious , based everything 've seen everything know 's going , thing 're looking forward next sort -- bearing mind safe harbor statement , necessarily google product , -- next six month year , what's getting excited ? three thing happening right extremely interested excited , many way , think reﬂects cloud market reset ai era . , number one , list company today brieﬂy talked , 're almost every industry , every size , almost every use case imagine . access 's created advanced computation really , really staggering . two daughter , 21 17 , they're school , various school college high school right . 're able utilize generative ai , sometimes authorization , sometimes without authorization next generation find way around . 're leveraging tool asking question getting answer . access like world 's knowledge way 's distilled synthesized n't like try ask 5,000 question -- raising kid , know give getting answer first second question . 's like democratization access advanced computation 've seen career , 's happening way feel almost invisible really easy use . that's happening kind individual level . massive wave discovery happening . following alphafold second generation alphafold , already dramatic impact think building block life treatment could envisioned might envisioned future precision medicine , example , something 'm excited . mentioned scientific discovery outside planet . thing exoplanets . well , heard organization called b612 foundation , went took computational tool ai went found asteroid -- old data , anything new , new telemetry . found asteroid using -- first version , like literally look image use expert try figure whether constitute asteroid . 're finding . 've found hundred quick period time . think ramification able characterize potential existential threat way future profound . , also , kind third one think lot medicine space . q - steve sparkes - grannis q - steve sparkesbut also last week , deepmind . google released way characterizing crystal structure , million new simulated crystalline structure , might someday power next wave development artificial crystal semiconductor , solar power rest . pace cadence discovery quick , rapid . met -- 'm wonderful place get see convergence research , computational realism organization might dozen people , output organization 10x 20x size . 's really incredible time technologist . really . think 's also time u consider unique characteristic company , sell ? produce ? ? think 're going facing question gen ai deal lot basic toil knowledge worker task , going like calculator let people focus value add ? make u stupid time ? lose ability innovate ? friction toil actually creates struggle ? create new idea innovation ? n't think 're going know answer one little . 's going amazing journey . , want thank much time today . real pleasure , steve . thanks well . thanks , everybody .
