're competing . 's partnership nvidia , tier 1 oem build system integrate different map , course want global vehicle operate map . china map , course different europe 's map . 're different united state ' map . vast ecosystem sensor , map , software , deliver global solution oem customer . , end end , single scalable vast ecosystem , 're seeing great promise . 's long-term play u . 's ups down . lumpy term revenue stream . nvidia committed . jensen said , 're really excited opportunity . many recent design win 've announced many come . , 'll open question . question answer right . great . let click video . yes . yes , thank , danny , . informative . get technology , want get thought market size design pipeline . single architecture . -- breadth solution various product . engagement -- describe engagement ? level 2+ level 3 , level 4 ? know level 4 , level 5 pushed initially thought regulation liability uncertainty around market . wanted kind dig deeper term engagement level 2 , level 2+ , seemed market next 10 year solution , maybe 's cost-effective lower power competition ? - danny shapiro - rajvindra gill - kimberly powell sure . 're right . mean lot different engagement . 's lot different program play right . going production , right ? announced xpeng , chinese new energy vehicle . 've taking order p7 sedan , actually start delivery month . 's based nvidia drive agx xavier . 's current production part . 's toyota using , volvo using . -- like said -- kind level 2+ production starting next several year . benefit , course 's part software-updatable architecture . card get better better time . also , course lot robotaxi-type engagement . company like zoox , like aurora delivery . potentially large volume still year , 's really great development effort still ongoing . 're seeing slowdown . think 'll see , course new ada offering , said , that's right , 's volume number , -- 're going able start announcing contract soon , several year get production . see today revenue split , 're kind 50- 50 term legacy infotainment business av development . 've announced , course , infotainment business go bit next quarter due overall state auto industry term production , thing stopped slowed new consumer sale also taking hit . , , year , 'll see , think , sizable ramp av . would agree market 's available industry really kind level 2 level 3 next 10 year longer get autonomous vehicle kind market ? case , -- there's existing kind competition , 'm wondering solution kind compete 's advanced requirement needed level 2 , level 3 -- versus level 2 , level 3. sure . - rajvindra gill - danny shapirowell think see deployment higher-end system vehicle , even software n't activated . , 's one particular company market 's taken approach . high valuation 're putting ai computer car . 're putting sensor around car . even though 's level 4 car today , 's selling extremely well potential get soon software regulation place . think car company need adopt strategy , . even 's shipping level 4 , capability upgraded level 4 , 's really strategy see happening sooner rather later . discus automotive socs , drive platform interacts technology vehicle ada infotainment hmi ? particularly around sensor fusion 's think 's lot differentiation term vehicle including higher advanced sensor , better example lidar . processing going oï¬ „ oaded solution , 's -- nvidia really shine always area . , 's great question . think 's key platform , , 's open , software-defined . 're locked specific camera specific algorithm 've tuned hardware . basically bake something . 's open platform . vast array different camera , different sensor . 're going 1-megapixel camera two 8 megapixels . , 's software update allow ï¬‚exibility . whether 's different sensor , , work closely tier 1 integrate sensor , build solution customer . whether 's different map , whether 's different algorithm , 's beauty nvidia platform base cuda deep-learning stack , 're able change time , right , software update , right , new algorithm . 's going apps come year two n't even thought today . software-defined nature platform , 's problem . thing , today , everyone iphone , android phone . could imagine buying phone n't get software update ? would n't , - rajvindra gill - danny shapiro - rajvindra gillright ? 're going fixed function device . virtually , every car road today like old phone ca n't update . consumer start see 's available get used , 's way anyone going buy non-software defined vehicle future . past , analyst day , 've mentioned -- 've quantified tam opportunity , roughly $ 25 billion . 've kind identified $ 25 billion kind driving level 2 , level 3 , 4 robotaxis , roughly $ 3 billion opportunity training development $ 2 billion validation . drilling testing validation , , would seem -- kind low-hanging fruit , vehicle need simulate autonomous scenario , et cetera , versus driving 1 million mile around physically , manually . 'm curious see uptake simulation product , training product dgx . seeing ride-sharing , oems ? describe constellation product platform . , 're right , constellation simulation product . 's still early day , right ? 've basically shipping maybe even year , right ? 's large development effort . 's going well see , , great growth opportunity u . 's part end-to-end ï¬‚ow give u ability , like said , test validate , key , scale really nicely . see distributed . people on-prem , right ? 're buying , maintain . others working cloud service provider , buy time simulator , 's good way kind start scale , see lot shifting on-prem . 've already announced toyota volvo truck big customer using u data center training , sim deploying road . 're absolutely right , -- , 're looking revenue perspective , timing data center big automotive , simulation growing . get reported part company n't ï¬‚ow auto number reported data center business . right . think 's interesting point . data center automotive kind data center general , seeing kind uptick based 're saying simulation versus kind physical , manual â€ “ - danny shapiro - rajvindra gill - danny shapiro 's interesting . , even company n't using nvidia vehicle , 're still large customer data center . yes . absolutely . regulation hurdle ? defined yet simulation versus actually manually driving collecting data mile -- raw mile nano taking bike whatever object physically . regulation standard that's emerging ? kind well ( inaudible ) ? 're active standard spot tie sae , others focused iso 26262. key thing engagement industry , partner . 're working nitsa . 're working federal highway safety board dot . -- also part world , 're active . think 's le logging mile disengagement able look scenario . 're trying come essentially autonomous vehicle driver's license . vehicle sort pas different test different scenario , run exhaustively simulation . 's also obviously going live on-road testing . think 'll see shift lot virtual testing , , 're going able effectively test really dangerous scenario real vehicle . another reason testing important even safety driver car partner , , safety driver , safety driver make sure nothing bad happens . 's potential collision impending , safety driver going take soon feel uncomfortable . prevents av system really actually put basis test would av system actually prevent accident . , simulation , let play . something happens sim , restart simulation , update software . learned . n't luxury real world something bad happens . - rajvindra gill - danny shapiro - rajvindra gill - danny shapiro kind shifting technology discussion , nine 10 minute . migrated drive platform new ampere architecture , 7- nanometer upcoming kind orin chip . thinking behind ? really provide kind end-to-end single architecture , everything 7-nanometer ? 'm curious could elaborate migration ampere architecture . sure . well , company , 're constantly innovating , constantly moving forward , right ? mean 's nature computing industry . 're always pushing developing innovating . single architecture key , though . 's like traditional auto industry something developed kind locked loaded five seven year , something brand-new developed wait , continuous ï¬‚ow . starting early drive px px2 system , people developing software could migrate current architecture moving forward orin . orin start sampling next year . development work today still happening current generation , 're able basically time machine accelerate development chip go production , 's like wait software started development . 're developing today . , 've seen industry , general , underestimated complexity challenge , underestimated amount compute required . 're constantly trying deliver higher performance , greater energy eï¬ƒciency industry . natural move , course shift orin ampere . , 's huge performance gain -- much 've ever seen past computing industry . talked kind 4x performance power eï¬ƒciency xavier solution . wondering go detail explain orin technological point view . primarily process node migration ? algorithm side ? - rajvindra gill - danny shapiroit 's combination , really . yes . process node . , 're able -- mean incredibly complex chip , 17 billion transistor . 've essentially built different part chip different type processing . different type data coming , different type algorithm . serial , parallel , declining base . 's lot different part chip tuned , give u greater performance consuming le energy . 've -- company , still call gpu , right ? 've gpus . gpus different kind processing gaming gpus decade ago . still name , -- 're really custom asics , xavier orin designed socs ai challenge specifically autonomous vehicle . look -- look kind robotics , kind shifting kind robotaxis -- would n't say , robotaxi . let 's say trucking -- seems immediate application av . robotics , stated bmw selected isaac robotics platform automate lot factory . 're using logistic robot built ai computing individualization . big -- percentage kind business , automotive business , think robotics side ? going meaningful kind growth driver robotics well kind trucking transportation ? yes . think robotics really different segment automotive . 's part oem business . think 's great potential , right ? mean everything move automated fashion . 's passenger vehicle , 's moving good , think 're going see lot , like said , trucking last-mile delivery we're moving people around . 's also -- whether 're fixed robot assembly line , cobots , right ? instead robot basically shut whenever human get manufacturing big change around robot , 're going see lot really smart robot able sense environment - rajvindra gill - danny shapirobe able work alongside human well logistics , whether 's factory , warehouse . even health care , market opportunity large . see great growth potential . great . last question term product portfolio . talked mounted windshield solution 's 10 trillion operation per second le five watt way robotaxis . feedback oems ? understand advantage single architecture . getting pushback term sole supplier ? want diversification ? really ease use ability kind update software kind vehicle life cycle change five seven year kind mobile phone life cycle every six nine month , 's going updated ? seems underlying shift type manufacturing cycle . sure . yes . product expansion direct result customer request , right ? think probably heard others saying 're going go commodity smart camera business . 's engineering expertise going leveraged . 're trying solve new problem , challenge n't solved . reality complexity car enormous . amount investment carmaker need make r & astronomical . maintain development engineering one front-facing camera architecture something separate , totally different code base , totally different hardware platform aspect , n't make sense . 've come u said , hey . want leverage 're high end able bring front-facing camera solution . , see carmaker adopting platform across whole spectrum seeing huge saving opposed saying , okay . want take one part one segment . , 's go car , training ai , n't want two totally different system 're collecting data , two different initiative . 're different development , different training , different testing , different validation across single architecture . 's enormous cost saving . - rajvindra gill - danny shapiro - rajvindra gill - danny shapiro - rajvindra gill - danny shapiro - rajvindra gill ability kind train import learning data center directly car , car able make inference decision driving software policy based data 've trained . 's right . fairly big differentiator . 's enormous . got -- , talk automaker , right , -- sometimes see partnership going enormous investment . , take two different investment car company combine . okay . right . wonderful . think 're heating . 're 11:55. 'll leave . thank much , danny . thank , stewart . insightful , thanks . right . thank , everyone . thank .
