( video presentation ) peak future . close , gaming strong 's growing . rtx transformed gaming . 've broken loose moore 's law . ai game changer apps specifically gaming , 're really looking forward opportunity brings . thank listening opening . excellent . vivek ? question answer think could watch game day long go q & . ? maybe start , showed impressive chart 's big upgrade opportunity . large deployed base nvidia gamers ? deployed base grown time ? - jeff fisher q - vivek arya - jeff fisher q - vivek arya - jeff fisher yeah . 've got installed base nvidia game , 's 200 -- let 's say , 200 -- 200 million nvidia gamers geforce-based pc . grown time ? mean , unit grown 10 % annualized . think 's probably fair estimate . got . one interesting statistic saw 18 % upgraded 3060 class . use 3060 metric , like 's special 3060 use metric , right ? used compare ( multiple speaker ) yeah . mean , 's taken u get ada series 60 class . 's lot talk much opportunity think 60 series . perspective , perfect upgrade huge installed base gamers . remember , 're bringing 60 series way $ 299 , price 3060. 's share team . mean , optimism 's market go pursue device . got . seen far term ada adoption trend ? think initially , launched high-end skus last year . think mentioned , launched 60 sku well . adoption ada ? typical -- somebody two generation three generation old ? 's typical gamer upgrading ada ? yeah , 's good question . kind depends stack we're talking . mean , shared 4070 tie relative prior gen . , fact , early result lower ada also -- strong . mean , 're -- 'm really pleased ada ramp . talk , upgrading . highest end , gamers -- 4090 gamer want play everything turned . want play aaa game , want play everything turned . perspective ray tracing dl , see 2x improvement gen gen. mean , 're upgrading ampere , going see really great improvement . 're upgrading prior gen , kind -- 's lot . go stack , especially 60 series , gamers much longer replacement cycle , 'll go back two generation longer . comparison relative turing lower-end device something even pre- turing . 're easily -- class , 're even basic raster gaming , they're going see 2x performance well . q - vivek arya - jeff fisher q - vivek arya - jeff fisher q - vivek arya - jeff fisher q - vivek arya got . 's typical upgrade frequency ? look conventional pc , know , people might upgrade like four five , six year , right ? likely five year six year timeframe . 's typical upgrade frequency enthusiast gamer ? yeah , 's -- 'll tell expectation , highest end , gamers upgrade every generation . mean , like best , likely wherewithal afford [ ph ] high end , gen. 's every 2 , 2.5 year , right ? get bottom stack , think 're stretching probably 3.5 year 4.5 year replacement cycle . 's probably , see upgrade new pc sold 'd shorter overall pc cycle , 's frequency , yeah . averaging somewhere around 3 . 3.5 , 3 , 3.5 year , something . 3 , 3.5 year . yeah . got . collect data upgrade typically -- assume would upgrade higher-end sku , right , ? yeah . yeah , 's good question . mean , -- gamers using client . think 've talked geforce , help keep pc upgraded latest driver automatically , help -- automatically set best setting every game , day , super important hardware . also share u history . among user , see 've upgraded graphic card inside pc . seen generation-to-generation gamers buying time . lift , 're buying continues increase , great testimony value place gpu relative component pc , 're willing invest great entertainment experience . answer question , yes , see increasing investment gamers upgrading within base gpu [ ph ] user . easy way , jeff , look much -- mentioned seen double-digit kind unit growth , right , installed base . content expansion nvidia ? also 5 % , 10 % ? right way think content growth time ? asked question think two instance hesitate use - jeff fisher q - vivek arya - jeff fisher q - vivek arya - jeff fisher q - vivek arya - jeff fisher q - vivek aryaword , crypto caused lot confusion . created normal lift pricing side . kind normalize , think average content right mix installed base ? say mix , 's mean content . yeah . okay . well , 's good question . -- -- first , look -- look mix upsell , remember , even day , 'll call , product shortage throughout pandemic work home crypto mentioned , n't really change gpu pricing . mean , way measured upsell core price ultimately got inﬂated end market . 've seen today ada class 699 $ 300 $ 400 upgrade mix high end . gamers buying high-end ada buying much lower class product , super exciting u . ampere , n't -- -- 'll speculate , $ 200 $ 300 upgrade range . turing probably bit , 've seen increasing mix upgrade time . get right . 're saying people upgraded ampere average bought card $ 200 expensive . upgrading ada buying something $ 300 $ 400 expensive ? right . relative . relative . yeah . relative pc . right . similar mix math long period time . also kind double-digit avergae across base ? simple -- like simplicity , give u -- unit mix , help u . - jeff fisher q - vivek arya - jeff fisher q - vivek arya - jeff fisher well , 've -- think -- 'm sure 'm answering question exactly , historically , 've seen 10 % lift unit 10 % lift asp time . n't see reason necessarily trend would change . see . one interesting thing also alluded kind synergy nvidia gaming data center . perspective , right , benefit data center company 's vice versa right ? benefit ? yeah , 's great question . thought 're going ask -- going throw money data center -- like way phrased better . -- effectively , 've nvidia long time , 's easy see company grown . mean , unified architecture across device . unlike , guess , many company , certainly scale , single engineering -- hardware engineering team single architecture team . core product , took atomic level , guess , 's cuda core . cuda core used build gaming franchise , also powering ai hardware . investment cuda core continue drive road map , data center ai side , well gaming side time . also , -- think jensen often describes company giant kitchen like involved cooking , imagine . inside kitchen -- really incredible technology shared across business , 've investing driving ai platform data center quite time , 're starting bring gaming . mean , could see ace gaming taking riva , nemo , omniverse , thing 've seen business , 're bringing -- formatting , bringing game development community . 's powerful company , way 've organized unified architecture powerful business . see try stray far outside , 's hard leverage investment . got . one near-term question . look back half year , 's lot concern consumer spending , right , non-rebound china forth . think growth gaming ? think expecting kind typical seasonal lift ? think right , thing going tougher second half , given consumer macro concern ? q - vivek arya - jeff fisher q - vivek arya - jeff fisheryeah . -- q1 came expected 's seasonal . expect year , 'll see . expect year play seasonably larger second half . think -- 'm also assuming stability relative stand today world . mean , anything change . china got pocket strength also macro weakness . europe , would say , similar scenario u . generally , base business , foundation business relative people want game want play latest game . ( inaudible ) caught , diablo iv , huge game open beta , soon going released . expect starfield call duty next really driver folk coming upgrading hardware game . spite -- macro , optimistic 'll see regular seasonality year . got . jeff , look next 5 year , 10 year , think remains hardware business ? become software subscription business time ? would pro con happen ? yeah . well , think 's going hardware business foreseeable future . mean , think game got long way go deliver always refer real life real time going take continued hardware investment economical way deliver really client . gamer buy pc , best experience local . may continue move stack . guy know , volume mainstream largely disappeared entry class gpu , gaming segment remains quite strong . -- n't know question cloud , -- ultimately , gaming expand , 'll massive universe . hesitate use word metaverse , may dirty word room . think large interactive shared experience going become super important important , way people going want play game time . local pc going used rendering ai modeling , cloud play important role time . -- cloud part likely subscription-based . software always component driving gaming , think 'll either buying subscribing hardware local cloud . right . maybe one last one . nvidia enjoyed strong 70 % , 80 % market share , right , among enthusiast gamers . competitor also bringing number new product , also buy transistor foundry . yeah . q - vivek arya - jeff fisher q - vivek arya - jeff fisher q - vivek arya give confidence maintain kind high , right , premium market share ? yeah . well , buy transistor .
