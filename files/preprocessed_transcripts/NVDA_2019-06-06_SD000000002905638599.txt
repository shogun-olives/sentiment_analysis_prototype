senior director automotive nvidia , danny shapiro , u . think 're going first 's going go slide quick overview auto business . 'll go question open q & . take away . sound great . well . good morning , everyone . thanks joining u . 's clicker somewhere . yes . . yes . -- mitch , probably got -- 've got everything guy got study . read quick . fine , 'll move . want spend couple minute kind setting stage respect 're focused automotive . 's artificial intelligence . think lot know . 've seen growth company moving graphic expanding artificial intelligence . 's really 2 aspect ai . lead directly auto industry . kind first phase based data center need able ingest lot data able train iterate build deep neural network acquired autonomous driving well basically everything else 's going term revolution health care energy exploration finance industry . ai transforming basically every type industry . 've trained model , sort take . model put vehicle . sensor data come . analyzed . use camera , radar , lidar perceive 's going , running deep neural network , make decision actually control vehicle . model apply across industry . term go vehicle , specific solution address problem end end . data center , dgx product , training . 's also used inferencing web application type server-based configuration . vehicle , run ai drive platform . , hardware software single architecture extends data center edge , vehicle , case . that's 're focused , hardware software ai . 're engaged basically everybody . hundred developer building nvidia drive . 're working car , truck shuttle bus construction equipment mining equipment agricultural . 's lot market . different company unique solution . they're working different kind sensor . 'll underlying problem need solve . 're foundational hardware software , many , many layer huge software team building platform , open others develop . 's 've seen great adoption . 's fixed solution . 's black box . totally customizable . everyone moving kind different way address problem . different type vehicle , different type use case . want ip 're able create custom application based nvidia drive platform . example -- stuff 're developing , , 's core ai system . see drive , right ? sensor , eye . image data go brain . recognize sign , lane , car , truck . replace human eye brain system . sensor data come , actually bunch pixel frame video . pixel number , let 's say , 's red , green blue value ? 's inherent information . ai able trained identify different type object scene , understand 's sign , 's lane marking , 's another car , truck , pedestrian . requires massive amount computing take place . 's running code 's written . software written data 's trained recognize pattern . much better u room . actually lot deep neural network running simultaneously car , detecting object , detecting lane , detecting free space absence object , processing lidar data point cloud , processing radar information , calculating distance , detecting pedestrian , right ? 's different neural net . reason want redundancy diversity that's required ensure safety road . n't want single app that's running everything 's reliant . fact 're detecting object , using one set data algorithm detecting lack object , call openroadnet 's free space , together provide sort double check 's safe drive want drive 're going hit something . , 're computing path , 3 different algorithm come together used decide going steer vehicle . mean though 's mass amount computing happen car . ca n't take traditional automotive component piece together smart camera controller deliver kind robust solution safe put road . saw zoox example , right , complexity 's going number thing 're tracking simultaneously . 're one partner . need ai supercomputing vehicle able deliver kind solution . thing see , obviously , big part safety . ensure 's safe ? early year , announced availability call drive constellation . system . 's data center solution . see going -- skin torn away . 's 2 server . one simulator 's using gpus generate sensor data . basically 's emulating camera self-driving car would see radar lidar would see . 's virtual environment . 're sensing everything 's going simulation . output top server pool gpus fed bottom server nvidia drive platform inside running full software stack . essentially , 're taking simulated input , 're trying process real time make driving decision -- accelerate , brake , turn left turn right -- feed back simulator . called hardware-in- the-loop testing . basically rack . one server represents virtual test vehicle . test kind condition , different type scenario , different weather , different time day control . 's way really accelerate testing validation . thing normally would n't want real world 're dangerous test . give u ability rapidly advance testing , development , course , validation autonomous vehicle . 's shot u running simulator . 's 10 -- basically replacing 10 virtual car . -- people often ask u , `` well many mile driven ? '' first , 's important know mile 've driven rather scenario , right ? use case ? specific corner case , rare dangerous event happen ? 're driving test car , usually nothing happens , want . 's pretty boring . 're driving along stay lane stop car come stop front . need ensure autonomous system able handle child running parked car somebody running red light driving wrong way whatever may . create exhaustive list scenario want test also bad weather , bad lighting sun setting , right ? constellation let u virtual reality . announced toyota -- gpu conference couple month ago , toyota using u vehicle . 're training system data center . 're using constellation test validate . exact hardware 's tested validated go car . thing 's -- unique u 's open platform . 's full end-to-end solution . , dgx based software ; cuda apps ; constellation , running drive sim software ; drive agx , go vehicle running full software stack others build application . give u really unique position marketplace approaching ai supercomputing bringing car . complete software stack extends cloud car . result , , virtually everybody industry 's building autonomous vehicle , car , truck , shuttle well mapping company , sensor company , ecosystem building nvidia drive . think point , want get number -- n't know much want talk . see growth potential really large , right ? 've -- investor day , 've talked tam market s30 billion little five year . u , bulk go inside vehicle volume ramp . different level autonomy level 2+ , advanced system -- basically taking technology putting fully autonomous vehicle . bringing market sooner , right ? 're necessarily waiting regulation place yet fully autonomous . 're taking surround sensor , 're taking ai supercomputing full software stack putting consumer vehicle today make safer . driver still loop . full level autonomous capability ensure car passenger inside stay safe . also huge opportunity u datacenter automotive customer specifically adopting gpus train neural network running constellation , drive sim software well . , great growth q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro stevesopportunities . 're early stage . know 've talking self-driving car long time . industry making lot promise projection . time line keep slipping . think industry recognized complex problem originally believed . key safety , right ? 're focused delivering safest possible solution . n't want bring something prematurely . result need compute , right ? need layer software , redundant algorithm . requires compute . 're standing still . we're continuing innovate bring technology market different type vehicle different type use case . , think jump question . okay . question answer yes . guess maybe 'll start slide right . since guy $ 30 billion tam kind . 's 2025. think , guess , ramp term 'll see revenue uptick driving versus training versus validation ? mean based , kind look like training probably first part 'd see . kind think exactly ? auto business growing last decade . predominantly driven infotainment . first foray bringing graphic technology car . five year ago , saw transition first led mature . company became ai company . started bring ai vehicle well . revenue vehicle still dominated infotainment . 're seeing kind new wave infotainment term ai cockpit . think 're going see growth . mercedes mbux , talk car , say , `` hi . mercedes . '' voice processing car , type sensor processing car part ui . point , yes , data center 're seeing autonomous vehicle customer make investment train neural network development side . ongoing . think we'll always working make car safer better add new feature . constellation , available , 're seeing huge demand . 'll great way testing validation . think 's going play big role , , working regulator , government agency need prove technology work simulation . result test thing show public regulator . - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro stevesyes . interestingly , something said earlier discussion said 's important look number mile 've driven look type environment . 's case , would able compare guy let 's say somebody else creating self-driving self-driving chip , like tesla something like ? would able -- prove guy tested environment something like ? yes . think california dmv engagement disengagement report published different company end year . basically say number mile 've driven many disengagement per mile , right ? driver intervene ? 's hard compare number . 's apple orange kind thing . company , we're developing vehicle . 're developing robotaxi service . limited number test vehicle drive around bay area , east coast europe asia . 's really test validate algorithm . work company , whether 's volvo toyota mercedes . 'll one deploying scale validation . , think mentioned , mile le critical opposed happens mile . simulation part come . make every second simulator count , whereas 're driving along 101 , 's diminishing return kind mile nothing 's happening . u , , -- want test , well , algorithm work fog ? put couple engineer car , drive way golden gate bridge . 're spending many hour getting . get , maybe fog lifted . instead simulator , actually recreate condition test kind crazy stuff happening plus fog different time day blinding sun . benefit simulation enormous . course , 're going replace real testing . 're going use dramatically augment improve . iterate quickly . update software simulator . key thing though 's like 're one test cloud something totally different real road , though . 's exact hardware software 's server 's tested put vehicle . 's true digital twin . okay . think different type car guy involved , see 're everything robotaxi delivery van , et cetera , right ? first , mean , asp differ 're trying put nvidia box car , vehicle ? secondly , one actually come first ? robotaxi side ? expect , guess , delivery van ? mean think term actual use case going forward ? - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro steves well think way 'd characterize capability system difference opposed whether 's car whether 's truck . problem , essentially saw heard morning zoox , right , -- 's sensor configuration . -- believe optimal sensor configuration . regardless , 're going put -- going need 360-degree sensor . 're going put different place truck versus car versus robotaxi shuttle . essentially , fundamental technology identical , right ? surround sensor feeding massive amount data need processed . different asp come play really much sensor processing need go level autonomy . level 2+ base system kind entry level going way level 4 , level 5 system . -- 're hundred dollar entry system , thousand dollar fully autonomous . interim , couple year , 're seeing level 2+ system coming market . announced tier 1 supplier still take technology , build integrate work u , deliver oems . continental , zf veoneer building level 2 u . toyota 's already announced production plan . volvo's already announced production plan . 's -- next several year . number trucking initiative , , level 2+ driver assistance much higher level driver assistance road today , often includes driver monitoring . ai play big part ensuring driver 's still alert , falling asleep , distracted . also , robotaxi deployment . 're working number robotaxi company , -- presenting , others whether 're bay area elsewhere world realizing problem solved supercomputing . ca n't put bunch smart camera . need ai computing platform . nvidia , leading technology front . , couple year , . early later year , right , mercedes , daimler bosch nvidia going deploying robotaxis san jose , , pilot program . last week , 2 simple one partner trucking side completed trial u.s. postal service , figure autonomous run mail dallas phoenix . long-haul trucking , think , one category though come much sooner others . got . since 're financial event , mean , one question . 'm sure wo n't like . gross margin 's trajectory , right ? go let 's say level 2 car let 's say level 5. realize asp may 10x , right . sort gross margin structure also occur ? ... - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiro think -- 's different maybe old nvidia , 's software hardware , right ? great gross margin software . enormous software stack . saw different neural network . 's part software . drive o software . neural net . bunch library tool . customer buying nvidia , 're buying whole bunch different thing u . , could hardware software data center , drive sim software software car . think 's 're going see lot additional growth u . one turn audience . think another one that's topical tesla 's comment -- created chip that's essentially going able self-driving ride . maybe talk u -- guess threat guy ? secondly , guy 's going differentiated versus tesla able ? tesla 's long customer partner . still , right ? data center full nvidia . -- think strategy , belief much aligned , think . 2 company u -- 're one framing solution self-driving term hundred trillion operation per second inside car topped . hundred top required . 's low-energy ecus -- 's dozen vehicle . centralized computing architecture . 's really way forward . tesla decided vertically integrate developing chip . elon made lot claim n't exactly accurate . 're little misleading term performance level . sort quoting old number multiple chip . reality , 're , think , 144 top self-driving computer . 're 320 topped . energy eﬃciency similar . , , kind mixed matched number make seem like big advantage . adhere law physic chip design . 's way come blue create something dramatically energy eﬃciency . volume relatively small . mean 're growing . make great product . drive one every day drive every day . 'll continue get better . think strategy really aligned . market , there's 2 option . 's tesla supercomputer self-driving . 's nvidia one . n't know anyone -- industry actually buy tesla one . q - mitchell toshiro steves q - unidentified participant - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro steves right . question audience ? ( inaudible ) -- n't know everyone heard question . 's assumes liability . 're seeing really carmaker , right ? 're selling car . autonomous mode -- like volvo said volvo autonomous mode , volvo assumes liability . 's way certainly pas occupant vehicle . 's like get taxi , right , 're control . 're liable . course , nvidia would responsible 's defect something nvidia . end day , 's automaker sort contract customer . kind follow , , see , , car company , least wave foreseeable future , people leading industry want control user experience . building application . they're necessarily coming u saying , give -- , 'll give car make self-drive . want able control whole user interface , experience . 're deciding drive autonomously , kind mode , somebody engage , 's app experience might tied together . , basically provided hardware software customize build application . like whole perception stack . may say , well , bunch engineer . 're work . benefit combine . perception ai . 're going maybe algorithm also running hardware . whole system get better multiple algorithm working together . -- 'll create application right top . ultimately , 'll decide car brake harsher turn sharper . 's going oem , 's going ultimately make driving decision . experience autonomous mercedes may different autonomous honda , right ? even though could using lot core technology , application final decision making would sort automaker . think key thing , though , car going much safer . 're going taking risk u usually take behind wheel . let 's go next question . colette stated time favorite game 's monopoly . aside , look auto business , mean company guy feel like compete ? mean intel 's got - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiromobileye well , right ? 's profitable okay point . need talk guy see , kind value proposition difference guy mobileye well . definitely . , think 're approaching challenge self-driving differently , mentioned . see problem complicated everyone thought initially . requires compute . mean already , tesla announced 're developing next-generation chip . regardless 've built , feel need compute . 're . 've already made announcement next-generation technology continues raise bar , deliver computational horsepower lower energy consumption . road map clear . think 's hard 're one -- competitor many different architecture . smart camera architecture . cpu . 're developing gpu supposedly . neural net processor . fpga . 's totally disparate component 're trying cobble together develop solution . different u , single architecture cloud vehicle make development much streamlined . 's open . mean 's biggest thing , , others developing . look ecosystem , enormous made easy develop . sort -- we've learned gaming segment , right ? created tool library . game developer deliver unique solution nvidia . 's kind fueled original growth . strategy really taking auto industry . open , end end really unique u . second one little bit interesting , , & side . guy bought mellanox , obviously bolstered data center side . mean see -- saw presentation talking sensor lot . guess anything guy think would interested term bolstering automotive capability ? yes . mean -- think , right , 're obviously focused still closing mellanox deal end year . 've made different investment automotive side usually . could simple one , usually lot -- number different software company . sensor side , 're pretty -- 're essentially sensor-agnostic . want work different sensor company . realize diversity redundancy sensor key . make sure support optimize stack different sensor company . make easy , , automaker q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapirotruckmaker customer integrate sensor feel want use . -- 're really focused trying -- n't feel need acquire specific sensor technology . think make better u , obviously , sensor , lidar company 's part nvidia , 's going potentially hurt ability work easily lot lidar company . perfect . ( inaudible ) one . ( technical diﬃculty ) service , could something host . datacenters . use in-house . mean 's kind usual product path nvidia we're creating thing never market . start developing using in-house first get released world . fact constellation , announced gtc year ago . -- spent year using in-house , fixing , improving , optimizing release customer . , could host . many case , 're wanting deploy on-site . 'll developing datacenters full . 's designed , , able test vehicle . configuration specific 're putting vehicle . whole goal exact hardware software go vehicle 's data center . make easy iterate . also know pass test , 's good put road . , think , pretty unique . benefit enormous . really accelerate development much way . -- mean 's toyota -- 're going see announcement along front soon term others really adopting whole pipeline . okay . perfect . thank coming . okay . thanks lot , everyone . 'll see guy .
