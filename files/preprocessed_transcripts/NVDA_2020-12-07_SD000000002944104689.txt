good morning . hi . tim arcuri . 'm semiconductor analyst ubs . happy -- next session , nvidia . nvidia , happy colette kress , 's cfo . hoping back new york next year . 's nothing better new york holiday . -- normal time , anyway . thank , colette . thank . absolutely . thank , much , tim , putting together . guess first , wanted turn simona . 's going read statement .then 'll start asking question . reminder , presentation contains forward-looking statement investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business . thank , simona . thanks . question answer - timothy michael arcuri - colette m. kress first wanted ask earnings follow-up , colette . guess first one wanted zero gaming . obviously strong quarter , 37 % q-on-q also year-over-year , far better even normal seasonal mid- high 20 new product launch . sound like could even better left revenue table due supply constraint . talk little ? primarily wafer supply ? think filled channel would see actual demand level end fiscal q4 ? take fiscal q1 ? yes . tim , thanks much question . first , let start audience help understand 've launched within q3 time period . opportunity u launch ampere architecture , rtx 30 series , launched overall gaming community . rtx 30 series launched overwhelming demand . gaming reached record level across desktop , laptop console . ray tracing essentially become new standard game . 're seeing big blockbuster come market season support rtx , including fortnite , cyberpunk , call duty , watch dog , really great game coming season . also major start upgrade cycle already 200 million- plus installed base overall gamers . gaming , know , gone beyond gamers see gaming sport , gaming art , game social also overall broadcasting professional . 's important time gaming entertainment sport continues solidified . prepare holiday season , also announced newest offering rtx 30 series . announced rtx 3060 ti priced $ 400 . rtx 3060 ti faster previous generation , rtx 2080 super also -- also higher price time . keep mind , add already shipping 3090s , 3080s 3070s . yes , within quarter , overwhelming demand . therefore , supply challenge . overall supply continues worked every day throughout quarter . hope see improvement move forward . expect take couple month u stabilize overall supply versus demand . 're seeing term supply , associated overall wafer . also global surge compute worldwide . driven challenge term substrate well different component . feel confident term guidance quarter . continue work supply quarter great time demand see right gaming gpus . - timothy michael arcuri - colette m. kress - timothy michael arcuri - colette m. kress guess next question would think impact fiscal q1 ? couple cross-currents . channel fill , going start help -- help fiscal q1 . also comping 14-week quarter fiscal q4 . typically , fiscal q1 somewhere 8 % 10 % seasonally . sort right probably think something better channel fill ? think extra week sort offset fact loss extra week sort offset fact fill channel ? yes . right , channel inventory low relates overall gpus gaming . 're still early part ramping rtx 30 series . continue move forward . keep mind , provide outlook one quarter time . correct . typically , business seasonally weaker q1 . additionally , q1 , 13-week quarter versus 14-week quarter q4 . expect rtx 30 series desktop , growth term notebook workstation cloud gaming ramp extend well q1 . got . okay . wanted ask gross margin . strong last quarter guidance quite strong , . sort implies somewhere low 60 % , seems like , gaming . 's kind back crypto level . guess question keep getting , sustainable ? sort maybe bit inﬂated degree gaming margin 've really begun shipping high end stack new product ? ship lower-priced product gaming gross margin come back high 50 , talk ? sure . let start correct mix likely largest driver inﬂuences gross margin . mix within market platform mix overall overall company level . move q2 q3 announced term gross margin , see gaming quite strong sequential increase thus inﬂuenced overall gross margin . q3 gross margin overall gaming year-over-year . continue ramping rtx 30 series looking improve gross margin go forward . see going q3 q4 , also announced expect increase gaming revenue q3 q4 . gaming meaningful percentage overall revenue whole . 'll continue look overall driving market rtx card . given - timothy michael arcuri - colette m. kress - timothy michael arcuri - colette m. kressoverall guidance gross margin . 'll continue look mix see play gross margin . got . okay . data center , got investor looking mid-single digit ex mellanox decline due chinese customer . 're sort looking mid-singles saying , `` well third straight quarter mid-single digit , pretty good . n't better , given launch ampere a100 ramp ? '' guess perspective , kind look guidance 's still quite bit better peer . sort tackle question concern investor , `` hi , maybe guidance could even better given ramping ampere '' ? look computing product data center , 's correct , expect grow mid-single digit move fourth quarter ai adoption , overall ramping a100 definitely continues . hyperscale business remains strong . expect hyperscales grow quarter-over-quarter , particularly overall compute product a100 continues ramp . see great momentum inference . a100 t4 overall inferencing . correct , overall networking line decline meaningful quarter-over-quarter sale china oem q3 recur q4 . however still expect networking 30 % year-over-year . little bit timing shift move q4 q3 . overall , h2 quite strong . stepping back , still early ramp ampere architecture data center , overall architecture believe u several year . also know ai accelerated computing top mind hyperscales enterprise period time . well positioned . tremendous portfolio platform , system software serve market . 're pleased progress far continuation see going forward . guess maybe point , could little different time term little elongated ramp ampere cloud still support v100 instance ? get sort rapid shift ampere hyperscalers , installed base sort hold back little bit make growth ampere little ratable volta . fair sort way think cycle versus volta cycle ? - timothy michael arcuri - colette m. kressso think a100 platform , monumental leap term performance prior overall architecture , ability really tackle hardest problem front u overall ai workload acceleration . last couple year , emergence conversational ai recommenders really broadened expanded overall size training workload . also overall training model continued advance period time . a100 important solution hyperscales ' availability term cloud researcher well enterprise vertical get access a100 . a100 also quite uniquely positioned overall platform system enables training inferencing within platform , speeding overall deployment overall choice hyperscales cloud enterprise choose determining platform use overall workload . volta absolutely still within cloud , important overall training workload 've already created . continue . keep mind , expanding growing overall ai , complexity , amount different industry use case , still see important piece using a100 , installing a100 cloud instance well . saw great uptick , fast , cloud instance across major overall hyperscales . speed adoption really unique platform system put enabled create cloud instance quite fast . we're excited ramp far . 'll see move forward next couple quarter well . maybe moving past earnings little bit looking little bit bigger picture . bitcoin 's , getting question whether 's opportunity benefit new card . know lot mining shifted asics 's hard really know much card used mining . -- think ? 've gotten much , think smarter demand side bitcoin , think . see whether card used bitcoin impact , might demand new card ? sure . thanks question . bitcoin mining , remember , almost entirely asics , okay ? understand miner interested using gpus mining currency , ethereum . recently , heard rumor channel partner increasing interest . lot factor inﬂuence mining interest . 're looking overall channel partner . - timothy michael arcuri - colette m. kress - timothy michael arcuri - colette m. kressi want make sure understand , 've spent quality time term getting better understanding overall supply within channel continuing work many angle good understanding volume volume world . still perfect overall process , continue , 're right , get better better . n't necessarily help u understand use overall card overall market . given discussion channel partner , colette , think hearing , think component demand right driven crypto ? right , 're sharing overall rumor increased interest . need look overall channel partner time . got . okay . got . maybe moving data center , move beyond near term , sort planning team think growth rate business ? past three year , grew 50 % fiscal '19 . obviously calendar '18 . n't grow fiscal '20 , 're back growing 60 % year . guess wall street would look say `` okay well , 's maybe 30 % normalized cagr business . '' course point , sort hit law large number . still ton headroom grow . think right long-term cagr business ? 's sort map last three year ? yes . overall data center business right firing cylinder , overall a100 ramp , inferencing also full throttle . overall mellanox growth great see overall acquisition continuation acquired . expect overall a100 gain adoption . great overall cloud adoption time area gcp , overall azure likely expand vertical industry , particularly 've released within last quarter dgx server oems . 're well positioned future within data center . full stack end-to- end accelerated solution really optimizes across compute networking also storage , enabling powerful scalable data center solution . includes area nvlink nvswitch , magnum io infiniband . full stack incorporating silicon , system software support growing diversity application workload key overall strategic story . - timothy michael arcuri - colette m. kressnow offer many different type computing platform . offer right hgx , dgx , dgx superpods well completing inferencing card well also gpu board . support every overall cpu 's overall industry well overall platform . could n't pleased 've built system overall performance perspective also key term programmability , software , sdks advance overall market . 're early stage . 're early stage ai accelerated computing . growth great sequentially well overall year-over-year . n't outlook past quarter guided . 'll see thing go . feel well positioned future time . got . got , colette . mentioned line blurring training inference ampere . sort used talk two separately used give u sense relative size inference within data center . roi customer huge . offer instance . also still t4 shipping . demand strong , . talk whether a100 sort begin cannibalize t4 tried capture sort term pricing maybe much headroom ? think people n't probably appreciate much pricing leverage , certainly ampere roi customer . talk price ampere number think whether 's going cannibalize t4 , think ? sure . short amount period time , couple year , reached hundred customer using nvidia 's platform overall inferencing . example , q3 , record t4 revenue shipment . yes , correct a100 platform designed training inferencing , successful providing option car customer buying stage determine long-term use platform knowing ability toggle back forth training overall inferencing . furthermore , also extended lead mlperf benchmarking result inference . last round , a100 beat cpu 30x versus 6x last year resnet-50 . also , a100 outperformed cpu , gosh , 200x recommendatory [ ph ] benchmarking well . recommendators [ ph ] important part overall inferencing workload right . tensort seventh generation already 1 million , probably 1.3 million downloads time . study installed base gpu infrastructure cloud , see across seven largest public cloud , seeing inference capacity - timothy michael arcuri - colette m. kress - timothy michael arcuri - colette m. kressexceeding overall cpu capacity . great outcome short amount period time . look a100 continuing adoption using gpus inferencing also giving ﬂexibility think building accelerated platform . 'll continue overall t4 . a100 great performance expanding workload , size model complexity inferencing 'll see year come . got . n't see a100 , least point , cannibalizing demand t4 ? 's engineered manner . really help complexity type workload . t4 great overall card well . t4 easily slot server oems , standard oem configuration well . really important market . 'll see choice overall customer think type inferencing demand . got . maybe double-click little bit technology . n't want get deep . something think getting lot focus 're arm architecture . new bluefield dpu that's obviously arm-based smartnic . 've porting software stack arm isa . guess given claim new arm neoverse core competitive x86 , seems lot stuff . maybe even displace x86 host cpu dgx . maybe could gaming arm-based pc . guess big question , degree , 're still sort tied cpu , x86 today . seems lot way capture currently x86 revenue going forward . talk broadly arm sort leverage arm today sort opportunity open ? sure . let first kind set stage term 're data center platform . data center platform system surely run accelerated computing ai workload . also seeing emergence modern data center built . modern data center continue move toward disaggregating cpu , gpu dpu . new dpu , better known data processing unit , allow u rearchitect overall modern data center . dpus also included doca software . look opportunity expand tam , probably $ 10 billion , overall dpu inclusion term data center offering . vmware 's decision , example , port esxi dpu major catalyst adoption well . key area data center working data security , data encryption get ready overall compute cycle . dpu - timothy michael arcuri - colette m. kressjust well positioned attract need . interest high . continue working major overall hyperscales sampling major oems . likely bigger play overall year come . 're correct , incorporating overall arm configuration . could n't pleased part newest overall launch product together , nvidia mellanox , one first launch . great work together term building . show ﬂexibility supporting every type infrastructure , every type overall cpu . 'll continue agnostic possible supporting accelerated computing go forward . got . maybe dovetail arm . guess perspective cfo , talk think arm would company financials going forward sort think much game-changer would allow , cfo seat ? yes . arm acquisition , 're extremely excited . pleased asked think purchase arm overall softbank . believe together creates important computing company age ai go forward . first , understand underlying thought together overall arm . give u opportunity combining nvidia term leading ai computing platform merging overall arm 's vast cpu ecosystem , ecosystem built 30 year tackled many different problem amazing energy-eﬃcient gpu many different type device . allows u also expand ip licensing portfolio arm nvidia's technology large end market , large market , including mobile overall pc , essentially licensing nvidia 's technology overall ecosystem . also ability infuse investment , infuse overall ecosystem expertise arm 's current work term server cpu road map speed pace believe definitely able benefit arm overall customer . allow u accelerate work provide cpu data center edge ai well many overall iot opportunity . also expands world developer . know , much computing platform lie hand developer develop platform . 2 million different developer . get merge developer arm 15 million . 's great universe jointly thinking computing platform going forward . financial perspective , course 're expecting accretiveness non-gaap gross margin , 're expecting accretiveness non-gaap eps well closing . great overall software licensing asset add - timothy michael arcuri - colette m. kress - timothy michael arcuri - colette m. kresscontinued complex revenue model today . could n't excited . 're going wait 're going overall regulatory process think overall signing closing probably take 18 month . sometimes get question investor 're talking arm , mean 's lot different aspect deal think make ton sense . part licensing channel , get question , `` well would nvidia buy arm ? could n't nvidia open ip start license '' ? talk ? sure . one piece overall goal acquisition really think providing existing customer , giving opportunity access best overall gpu technology . nothing changed 're already receiving adding overall possibility . that's one piece . could way overall partnership ? sure . thinking type investment know need order advance 're data center , data center complex term evolved last decade . really helping understand knowledge expertise 've understood data center , believe , accelerate work .
