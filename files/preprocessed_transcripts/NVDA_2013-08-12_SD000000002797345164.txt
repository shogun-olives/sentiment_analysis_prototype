good afternoon . n't know , mike mcconnell . semiconductor analyst pacific crest . pleased afternoon chris evenden , director investor relation nvidia . want keep open interactive possible . 'm going start question . question , obviously would encouraged . maybe kicking , think , bright spot , clearly , company far year record high gross margin . maybe talk reason margin expansion ? think , importantly , record high set last week conference call , sustainable think level ? yes . 's fair . think 's worth taking step back noting recent run last couple year , 've steadily increasing -- trend undeniably . previous record high gross margin 46.3 % . came time amd hopelessly uncompetitive product . market essentially . 's worth reiterating far 've come couple year . 56 point margin market 's strong . amd 's got -- product okay . reason , answer question , nature company changed . based geforce anymore . quadro tesla . high-margin business , 70 point plus business . also pc market evolves , 're seeing traditional low-margin business get weaker . gaming business , especially rtpc , know concept talked 's better -- insightful way look pc market mike mcconnellis separate specialty pc general-purpose pc . mean specialty pc device someone buy specific reason . , reason might gaming might industrial design quadro might research simulation tesla . specific reason go buy pc , whereas broader part market , like , general-purpose . bit email , bit web surfing , check facebook page . 's bit market 's really trouble . 's bit market get cannibalized tablet . people look whole market whole say , well pc market well , possibly well . answer , well gaming niche carved u 's extremely profitable . well sort corporate average profitability niche . niche grows 10 % year . apparently , independently rest pc market 's travail . that's main reason behind . quadro significant business . tesla marvelous quarter well . think telling part tesla 's result quarter revenue came . internal revenue shade short record course ( inaudible ) . revenue came oem business . oem setting cart someone else rather big wing . like , last record quarter -- record quarter tesla built world 's first powerful supercomputer , necessarily favorable impact revenue . time , 's baseload . 's run rate business . -- really feel tesla reaching tipping point always hoped would reach , enough application supported tesla . scientist engineer , -- ( forming ) weather simulation , specifying new machine weather simulation , say . know want gpu acceleration 's already supported software . great news u 's much lower touch business sense go oems , opposed oak ridge national lab engagement , course everyone company fire drill month . great 's ten million dollar business . ca n't scale business way . whereas run rate business , scale business . steady dependable base keep growing . main lever move margin . second part question maintained . 's hard see would n't . drag margin , like , tegra . , tegra -- tegra chip business slightly corporate . corporate gross margin . 's far . 's huge drag . grow , drag margin . time , desktop gpu growing , tesla growing , quadro growing . sort -- balance , basically . look like margin fairly stable , think . know , 56 point margin . thing think cost side 've switched model source wafer tsmc . wafer-by basis opposed per-die basis . , new product , eat lot cost chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnellout gate early . 're favorably getting higher margin towards end product lifecycle . kepler , kind second year shipment . next year , get ( multiple speaker ) -- ought profitable ever get 're saying ? 'm saying . anything next year think transition away kepler maxwell ? going something kind think model stuff like ? well think first thing bear mind tsmc know much money want get wafer , regardless charge . , clearly , changing risk assumption upfront . used risk ; risk . way , whole industry operates wafer ( multiple speaker ) . certainly outlier . -- special case around 28. know transition 28 like . 40 -- transition 40. 's changed . aligned rest industry . -- 40 ( nanometer ) transition , put whole new team help u move new process node . worked , closely tsmc . 'm seeing huge cost risk . moving maxwell , definitely got die size performance per millimeter squared religion kepler . 'd lost focus bit previous-generation product . fixed . maxwell -- mean , better believe focused thing . performance per millimeter squared performance per watt , key metric evaluate product . yes , n't see ( multiple speaker ) danger . understood . question audience ? 've got several keep going . one thing also look wanted stay graphic side first transitioning part model . unit share all-time high versus amd . see opportunity take share traditional geforce business ? n't happen , initiative feel like peripheral really move model probably fastest ? extent x -- maybe tegra , kind obvious growth prospect ? ( tam ) ? chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden 's good question . amd , think , aggressive know recently term trying win share back u . 've tremendously expensive software bundling program , think 've five six game offer free high-end part . three four midrange stuff . 's like , $ 100 , $ 200 , $ 300 worth software face value . yet hardly begun move needle market share . 're certainly pretty confident maintaining level . term gaining share , honestly , year n't see share changing much one way . major discontinuity would cause . going forward , continue try build strong gaming ecosystem around product . working developer ensure best performance hardware ; reliable , dependable performance hardware . latest feature game stand visually competition . feature like geforce experience , help user -- 's software tool user download . 's downloaded seven million time already . automatically set gaining setting bunch thing well help user experience . build tighter link customer . 's quite lot customer loyalty space . 've got group ( inaudible ) . 's part , yes . part dependable best performance . okay . attach rate . one thing think 's going changing intel , obviously , going adding new functionality . performance characteristic atom core , maybe held back past , added challenge arm starting increase . see situation bay trail start occupy skus overall mobile computing market , risk , believe , graphic attach rate ? something 're participating anyhow . 's -- 're going still occupying high-end . n't matter happens ? think scenario ? mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evendeni think latter true . let expand . , go back general-purpose pc versus specialty pc model , people buy speciality pc buy discrete graphic . integrated n't good enough gamer . mean , sure , integrated graphic get -- good enough play last year 's game low resolution optional setting set zero . 's never going good enough latest game . let 's take table moment . , look remainder market , general-purpose pc , , sell market almost entirely notebook . scenario , notebook oems looking differentiate pc . $ 400 notebook , $ 500 notebook . justify consumer spend extra $ 100 ? answer sometimes ( ko-i 3 ) , ( ko-i 5 ) , ( ko-i 7 ) , climbing ladder . answer sometimes graphic versus discrete graphic . 's -- consumer tend focused graphic performance . buying -- 're buying 's good discrete graphic , better . 's probably far thought process go buying process . intel come back better graphic performance , 're missing point 's driving market . graphic performance drive market . , bay trail interesting device . 's never going gaming pc . performance . could compete market . bay trail discrete graphic really interesting proposition good enough cpu performance application . put discrete graphic chip . come back idea talked year ago , optimized pc , balance investment gpu cpu appropriately get good gaming machine much lower cost . honestly n't see affecting attach rate one way . could argue way . right , right . guess conceivable 're going get ( inaudible ) atom use money support something else . saving -- saving $ 40 $ 5 going bay trail core ? get graphic card much . okay . look design win back half year , seeing skus kind going towards bay trail 've seen past ? look point ? mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden unidentified participant chris evenden unidentified participant chris evendeni would n't want anticipate 's going go . 'll wait get wait get bit closer . , fair enough , fair enough . 've got ask . 'm demure . 's fine . question ? 've got one question . ( inaudible ; mic inaccessible ) . wondering guy see ( pcds ) . risk potentially explosion ( inaudible ) , potentially developer start dedicating resource gaming tablet phone risk ( inaudible ) development ? -- survey gamers gdc -- game developer gdc like month , two month ( e3 ) . 48 % developer said developing pc . 55 % said developing mobile . 11 % said developing next-generation console . would say open gaming , mobile pc , growth area . 's innovation happening . 's excitement . low number developing next-generation console next generation console come extraordinary . ( inaudible ; mic inaccessible ) yes . n't look like 's success . , 's early say whether 's failed whether whole console generation failed . number 've seen market size suggest pc gaming 2015 $ 20 billion business . playstations together half , ( $ 10 billion ) ; xboxes together half , ( $ 5 billion ) . mike mcconnell chris evendenthe thing pc gaming little revenue go package software sale . 's easy walk game stop think , well pc gaming dead . 's something like 80 % software revenue directly online , whether 're buying game online , whether 're subscribing game online , whether 're getting game free in-game app process , whether 's ad-supported , whatever mechanism . 20 % packaged revenue -- packaged software revenue . pc gaming market vibrant extremely healthy . 's large part success 've shown margin forth last couple year . pressure mobile ? guess sense -- think there's also synergy well . certainly -- seem -- seems console suffering pressure , pc . 've come bunch -- gaming strategy allows u build synergy strong -- going say ( redoubt ) . 's probably poetic . fortress pc gaming -- build synergy actually translate success mobile gaming well . shield device , example , stream game pc . someday great grid climb . thing allow u build similarly strong fortress -- defensible , profitable fortress tegra business mobile . moving opex . always run comment ( jensen ) saying , n't believe company opex problem , 've got revenue problem . said , though , believe 45 % company revenue right opex . 's percentage rev . -- -- plan type relief opex going forward ? company still investment mode -- lot leverage model , choose rationalize opex even slight extent . think karen jensen pretty clear earnings call . think 'll hit somewhere close $ 1.6 billion , non-gaap , target year . wo n't ( $ 1.600 billion ) . 'll close enough claim straight face hit target , right ? mean plan make cut opex end year . , still think 's lot tegra . n't think point want seriously consider endangering future revenue investing appropriately . plan yet still believe tegra . look tegra -- tegra revenue-challenged year . 's doubt . 's lot reason , primarily failure one ecosystem jensen alluded call . tegra 4 late . made diﬃcult decision . conscious decision , delay tegra 4 could bring tegra 5 tegra 4i . product track schedule . demonstrated logan , probably become mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnelltegra 5. demonstrated logan siggraph last month . showed game changer term graphic performance -- 's real discontinuity mobile gaming mobile ap . thing ready beginning next year . -- 's lot leverage topline well . grow topline beginning next year , good place well . , though -- important getting lte working , good , still win ap anymore ? lte ? importance ( multiple speaker ) -- think lte pretty important . know , 're going qualification discrete mode i500 integrated part tegra ivi . qualification going according plan , 's progressing quite nicely . 's nothing really report 've actually certified . 's going fine . may actually see i500 device back half year . tegra 4i certainly next year that's simply long product take come market . 'll ready . think people sometimes miss great year last year tegra , $ 160 million , without modem . think competed high-end last year , tremendous headwind . right ? fact company could buy lte modem tegra 's top competitor . 's miracle made business last year . unless really something special , believe tegra ( space ) . going forward , though , 's going watching lte quite closely , though . that's going pretty much mandatory checklist ( inaudible ) ? n't know mandatory non-cellular connected tablet device . , put wi-fi combo chip . certainly -- think cellular conductivity going certainly increase , especially carrier coming reasonable pricing plan pay twice . pay extra every extra device . question ? well need obviously discus licensing deal , big change company 's strategy . maybe give u , chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evendenupdate think first licensee announced . could start see royalty type customer 're going . fun stuff . 's -- part market n't accessible tegra . whether 's 's vertically integrated oem whether 's market area n't resource go . 're inaccessible tegra chip . , monetize ip market ? answer licensing people build chip . smart tv might another one . 's market 've looked last year . decided 's big enough u go directly . hand , come really good chip enable someone else go market , fantastic . would lovely get one large vertically integrated oems ( inaudible ) new market well . 's another way monetizing tegra regard . , timeline , 's little way . think -- someone want license call today . would start building chip . would bring chip -- would put chip device bring device market . 's really 18 month ? two year , probably ? something like . mean , know -- 's way . 's long-term strategy unless find someone . 's main thrust licensing agreement . thrust find people infringe patent take closer look . would start generating -- could start generating revenue rather quickly . thing announce announce . . 've also getting question lately intel royalty ( screen ) , quite sizable look earnings contribution year . what's confidence 2016 get renewed ? guy thought started talking ? think ? 's diﬃcult predict -- 'll legal -- 'll sort negotiation conducted lawyer , probably , 2015. take step back explain cross-licensing deal . cross-licensing deal core agreement sue . understanding 've got whole bunch clever engineer working advanced processor technology . intel got whole bunch clever engineer working advanced processor technology . 's pretty inevitable point 're going come idea . n't want constantly looking shoulder worrying 've infringed somebody else 's patent right . enter cross-licensing deal . reason intel end paying u -- actually pay well . lot le . 's ( 66 ) one direction , ( 6 ) direction per quarter . reason end paying u lot revenue risk patent litigation . 's stop-ship mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evendenintel 's product , could cost $ 55 billion year , opposed $ 4 billion year would cost u . 's get . , patent -- know running low time . 'll quick . agreement date back 2004 , entered cross-license exchange right build chipsets . intel reneged u would see . reneged agreement . took court end paying u right chipset . , going forward 2016 agreement end , 'll still bunch engineer working patent , 'll also bunch engineer working patent . 's still danger 'll treading 's toe . 's -- never predict anything . ca n't predict anything core ( inaudible ) better . probability 's high ? think ? 'll see . okay , okay . think 's time . thank much , chris . appreciate . thanks , mike .
