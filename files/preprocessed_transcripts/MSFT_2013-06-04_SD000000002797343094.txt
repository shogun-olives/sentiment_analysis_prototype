thank . much coming conference muggy san francisco . delighted able introduce next company . bob kelly , corporate vice president microsoft server tool business ( inaudible ) ir department . bob 's going talking business 15-20 minute 'll open question answer . , bob , take stage . thank , kash , appreciate . 's good see everybody . kash mentioned , name bob kelly . 've microsoft almost 17 year . done everything possibly imagine server tool business . pretty wild time segment right . wanted set framing essentially think server tool business . one , 'm expecting since 're know 's little secret . 's little secret rest world business that's almost $ 19 billion large . let 's tell little bit see going ecosystem . course , presentation fact contain forward-looking statement . take . thing remember server tool business . first 's really big business . 's $ 19 billion business microsoft five-year cagr 11 % . 's pretty stunning look underneath , hardware market year , server hardware market , going decline . growing 11 point market 's actually declining really pretty shocking . , strong business company . contribution margin continues grow year-over-year nearly 50 % . , healthy business getting healthier every year . six separate $ 1 billion business within server tool business . remarkable statement . started server tool window server shipping 3,000 unit month business 's got six separate $ 1 billion business across management , database , o category , phenomenal achievement . yet 're also continuing grow share position . grown 4 point last year hyper-v market share . 's versus vmware market . sql server premium , high-end skus growing greater 20 % last five quarter . window azure , , new addition portfolio added 50 service last year . remarkable , remarkable success story actually one think really set next phase growth . thing want understand though see . think understand see help frame want look success failure . really four fundamental transformational trend occurring ecosystem . trend built sort underpinning , , virtualization compute , storage network . computer , storage network virtualization . four trend see outside ring , 're important actually trend forming strategic direction 're taking server tool business . first new social app pattern . see facebook twitter pinterest linkedin . massive scale . new social application pattern really driven whole new set verb like share . intelligence built . auto-fill search . really intelligent application new paradigm application built . 's consumer application , new kind apps finding way commercial sector well . data explosion . staggering statistic . 90 % world 's data created last two year . iec predicting 44x growth data next five year . could either daunting thing hit customer tremendous opportunity drive new application new scenario around insight . 's 're viewing . think 's actually really unique opportunity data becomes new platform tool around data , oﬃce 365 bi category , really become , powerful customer actually derive new value new scenario business . consumerization . many carrying smart phone ipad ? maybe even surface , dear god . consumerization reality . something true -- every one u bringing device business expect application . huge burden . build new system secure , manage stay compliant corporate policy device control . 2015 's forecasted 2x number smart device people planet . new reality business deal new reality . finally , cloud computing exploding like crazy , whether 's window azure aws google 's cloud platform salesforce rackspace , tremendous capacity built . much capacity trend , really unique opportunity create new value go drive transformational change , within industry within customer . , responding aggressively . call cloud o modern platform world 's apps . fundamentally 's happening new world going require new way managing system . new way deploying service . new way today think resource management operating system , global scale . system 's distributed across million server order deliver need transformational trend . modern platform world 's apps fundamentally transforms data center . need think data center four wall customer owns . instead wall logical 're wherever application . new cloud o take account data center 's redefined . enables empowers people centric . turn actually 's device important , 's actually user experience . user become center , way around . long 's central made decision user . new world , user making decision deal . manage , secure comply . new platform unlock insight data , small , big , whatever kind data want . key insight . 's data per se , 's really derive new pattern emerging new ability actually see shocking amount data otherwise three year ago would thrown away discarded . actually keep data actually really interesting thing find user , business therefore take better action . finally , modern platform also enables whole new class business application . cloud o really whole new construct . 's longer thinking thing singular machine , 's vast distributed fabric enables whole new class application , whole new case user scenario fact new way thinking . make cloud o unique ? microsoft 's approach , cloud o , one consistent platform span customer 's data center , data center third party service provider . one consistent platform allows customer deploy application solution infrastructure want . expect certain level consistency . cloud o enables ﬂexible development . really mean support dot net world-class way , we'll support running linux fabric , 'll support php java . fact , today scale . flexible development mean also developer , customer build application decide deploy later . 's way customer want build application . want build deploy wherever see fit based business need . cloud o also need unified management approach . unified management approach mean single pane glass company look asset , matter 're deployed , premise , premise third party . really important part , end day today think data center , tomorrow logical boundary need able manage asset one single pane glass . part , need common identity fabric , meaning need able log set asset deployed anywhere planet able federate across multiple platform . need integrated virtualization across platform , one common layer virtualizing part stack premise , premise third party service provider finding complete data platform . cloud o absolutely unique actually enables set capability premise customer want deploy application solution . 's u talking , tremendous momentum . tremendous momentum . 're going see slide lot ampersand . really mean approach fundamentally approach , approach . 's private cloud public cloud . 's microsoft service provider . fundamentally approach . 93 % fortune 1000 use active directory primary log window azure active directory 265 billion authentication . software , 3 million entity , corporation , business using azure active directory . 46 % database deployed world using sql server . 300,000 sql azure database window azure . similarly 76 % enterprise apps using window server 100,000 website hosted window azure . . core strategy deliver fabric 's cloud o allows customer deploy solution see fit . 's really q - kash rangancritical customer tell u every single day get way running business . must able actually see fit , based whatever rule regulation play . 've tremendous year product momentum , tremendous . whether window server 2012 system center 2012 neutralized playing ground vis-a-vis vmware competitive offering go take bunch share . sql server 2012 , really upped game show significant revenue growth share adoption database category . window intune , management server . sas offering managing pc environment . tremendously successful product u accelerating growth category . course next 12 month significant product coming well . addition , said , 50 new service 've delivered window azure year , yesterday announced whole new set update window azure well tech ed event new orleans . window server system center blue , 've heard window client side window blue , window 8.1 , 's also server release coming timeframe bring bunch innovation around window azure server release . customer take advantage window azure deploy premise . sql server 14 feature called always backup , meaning actually literally continuous backup window azure customer therefore disaster recovery solution built box . cloud bi , visual studio , window intune , key product innovate reiterate course next 12 month . , quick view frame server tool business lens cloud o . lot different category play . database category , o category , management category . we're incredibly successful . world move new demand 's imperative - - customer tell u 's imperative fabric enables deploy solution anywhere see fit . , 'm going pause 'll sit take q & . thank . question answer thanks much , bob . 'll ask couple question feel free jump question well . 've heard lot work azure -- guy azure amazon web service talking infrastructure - bob kelly q - kash rangan - bob kelly ( inaudible ) strategy well . see azure playing alongside aws ? going head-on conversation guy different segment market ? see unique strength point differentiation versus amazon web service ? see couple different thing . one first foremost lot buzzword around cloud . infrastructure service , platform service , software service . 're different way thinking core capability , , platform . real term , infrastructure service sort current application model delivered rented vm cloud . platform service set managed apis . window azure delivers . full set platform service capability full set infrastructure service capability , meaning customer actually deploy existing application model new application model window azure . 's . feel good 've built . reason think 're actually going successful versus amazon really end day think 're targeting enterprise customer first amazon targeting startup first . two different starting point . 'm trying denigrate business , 've done successful job really capturing momentum around startup ecosystem . presence enterprise space , amazon owns consumer credit card , microsoft owns enterprise credit card . establish beach hold customer actually extend data center window azure using ia pad , think really , really strong position differentiated offer versus aws . got . hear lot private cloud , public cloud . guy public cloud offering . also product load offering enable product data center . see customer spending amount investment dollar ? going towards public cloud private cloud what's interestingly called hybrid cloud ? ( inaudible ) ? well obviously based strategy think end state notion hybrid , cloud , cloud third party cloud . given life cycle , , adoption public cloud technology , relatively early life cycle , vast majority least spend server tool , $ 19 billion , software customer deploying premise . , , early sign strong momentum . last year stood , told 100,000 customer window azure . today 200,000. 're adding 1,000 customer day . 30,000 customer adopted infrastructure service offering q - kash rangan - bob kelly q - kash rangan - bob kellywent live april . really seen tremendous momentum . 50 % fortune 500 least one application window azure . strong momentum . additionally , look software sell cloud software server tool business , either delivered azure delivered service provider , 's $ 1 billion trailing 12 month . 've seen really solid momentum . tremendous capability private cloud huge revenue 're starting see early sign software delivered window azure service provider getting scale . long way go . really good start . look business model ( inaudible ) ( inaudible ) like , ( inaudible ) business model azure , public ( inaudible ) offering versus private ratable ( inaudible ) acquisition versus license . know core server tool business majority business structured programming contract 's ratably recognized . look incremental value azure deal versus regular server tool deal , breakeven revenue dollar perspective , margin dollar perspective ? 've gained ? give ? put take ? one question know 'm rally going answer . yes . 'm going answer different question . put context . today server tool business , $ 20 billion revenue , category enterprise software $ 100 billion . $ 100 billion participates total $ 2 trillion business . think 's happening actually entire $ 2 trillion dusted . entire $ 2 trillion grab . going major winner major loser transition . okay ? actually n't look cannibalistic substitution risk . look really significant potential revenue margin dollar growth . second thing remember , every analyst 've ever looked say 70 % every enterprise dollar going maintaining existing system 30 % new capability . could unlock ability deliver backlog apps , there's huge opportunity well . 's 're seeing . actually see cloud thing additive business , subtractive . strong position premise , multi-year contract , 're able monetize transition hybrid world eﬃciently effectively . q - kash rangan - bob kelly q - kash rangan - bob kellyso macro 're playing way bigger pool believe fundamentally 's additive 're getting today . transition rate customer want . u feel win-win . look large enterprise , 've got 7,000 using azure . application workload 're running azure ? 're seeing everything , right ? obviously see everything cheeseburger ( zingali ) consumer facing application . go core enterprise see application like company called easyjet . easyjet company europe basically seasonal ﬂights . 's kind core business model . way used spring 'd ship bunch server people site airport , stand system , collect fee , collect ticket collapse go . well actually handheld , scanner . use window azure giant service bus cloud 's integrated mainframe . cloud fabric allows completely transform business using existing asset . 've got company like milliman , monte carlo simulation actually need tremendous compute capacity . demand . stand thousand compute node , run simulation , pas answer deﬂate . , different application pattern . real . also see boeing built consumer facing experience immersive -- wanted show dreamliner . wanted consumer facing experience sort see thing like . built really rich client fed application . everything . 'll see core , , transaction capability application prem moving cloud well . got . ( inaudible ) talk industry talking management automation oﬃcer top virtual machine installed . big vm install base view management opportunity ? microsoft going monetize ? look idc 's data , idc hyper-v share north 30 % vmware share 55 % , number 's correct . . said , 've grown point quarter course last four quarter . aggressive growth get point essence enterprise space 'll two platform . customer hyper-v based world esx based world . q - kash rangan - bob kelly q - kash rangan - bob kellythe money hyper visor . money automation management . system portfolio , one $ 1 billion category , important piece way monetize . importantly 's also important piece strategy cloud o . cloud o , construct deploy application wherever see fit , whatever suit need best . system center single pane glass allows manage , monitor , provision , update application wherever sit . strategy really fundamentally unlocking power cloud o . final thing 'll say customer want migrate competing stack , system center manage esx manage provision infrastructure customer decides move . seeing customer ? 've seen tremendous interest , let say way 's still -- released 2012 last october-november . tremendous interest customer moving deploying next esx course next 12 18 month . bullish database industry vertical gain share database industry ? absolutely latter . thing 's happening across ecosystem -- said option . well option . think say . think -- look , -- revenue growing 20x % . look industry database category , 's growing 6 % , 7 % , 8 % , somewhere range . 're growing anywhere 2 3x market . 's good start , okay ? competitor stronger position category revenue standpoint . worked -- , strong product , strong momentum . additionally , look public cloud space , unlimited opportunity u . application kind migrate new world delivering database service , whole notion tier 1 apps get disrupted . iceberg oracle hold enterprise start melt . melt market 's moving public cloud way consume deliver service , chipping away . q - kash rangan - bob kelly q - kash rangan - bob kelly q - kash rangan - bob kelly q - kash rangan turn audience , thought open source initiative , open stack , closed stack ? feel customer whether want microsoft participating ? 'd say 's complicated answer . first honestly n't think open stack chance success public cloud . reason say economics public cloud extraordinary scale order derive deliver economics . 's ﬂat true . player going scale microsofts , amazon , google , maybe salesforces . 're , far . 's huge capital outlay . huge commitment . someone take -- openstack successful public cloud , one bigs would take openstack completely weld thing offer . 's way ever get scale real usage public cloud . look private cloud , think actually openstack likely shot gaining traction . somewhat good reason . mean ecosystem historically never wanted one-horse raced . prefers two-horse race could three-horse race , 'd great . think enough momentum around openstack like ( plaeda ) hp others private cloud . different dynamic . like chance world . firmly believe public cloud space one wo n't momentum . ( inaudible ) private cloud , customer pausing they're evaluating openstack ? would assessment maturity openstack , vis-a- vi guy ' product ( inaudible ) ? someone could find customer 's deployed openstack scale , 'd like talk . apparently ebay using ( inaudible ) . 's , ebay ? - bob kelly q - kash rangan q - unidentified participant - bob kelly q - unidentified participantyes . yes , know . know . chance talk 're hard find . 's awful lot interest openstack . 's awful lot deployment . 's big difference . quite frankly , move forward need hyper-v system center integration . customer demand , 'll . 're afraid stretch imagination . n't see enough momentum behind yet , see lot noise . got , okay . point , question audience ? 're first china azure platform versus awf . talk little bit partner chose expected uptake ? one core responsibility actually china specifically delivering window azure offering china . company 've chosen work 21vianet . essentially really four player could work . telco 21v . real term , imperative work local company 's part parcel take actually operate china comply local regulation , et cetera . also imperative u way actually beneficial ecosystem large . 21v number one non-telco hoster data center operator china . chose specific reason . unending upside u china . unending upside . know , massive piracy challenge across microsoft software , particularly china . steve said time past cost company billion dollar year . that's lot profit . could utilized lot good way . 's much harder steal service steal packaged software . service going absolutely key success china . 're , excited early momentum . coca-cola , ( inaudible ) , redbox , whole bunch really great customer adopted u china hopefully later year 'll general availability . talk growth 're seeing azure revenue growing opportunity microsoft . think customer perspective , roi customer getting going azure compare platform ? q - kash rangan q - unidentified participant - bob kelly q - kash rangan roi 's funny end day something compare . really 's customer tell u 're looking azure . 're looking azure actually agility , cost reduction . actually 's fundamentally ca n't deliver need deliver current construct . even server virtualization , still take long provision environment , provision application architecture , et cetera . instant capability , get application much faster . 's actually first thing 're seeing actually agility , like tcr roi . customer ( inaudible ) look like . whereas premise world look like . tell roi , et cetera . public cloud , least experience , n't look like yet . given relation -- mean given install base important premise today , n't little bit conﬂict interest 're , guess , trying free-up maintenance dollar ? essentially maintenance dollar could paid guy -- buy product buying product decade . n't little bit conﬂict interest might manage may best positioned manage 're trying grow essentially disruptive really disruptive technology ? , 's kind conversation typically customer . really turn , everyone familiar andreessen said , right ? software going eat world . look $ 2 trillion spend , vast majority non-hardware software thing . 's maintenance , 's people cost . thing actually -- software automate . 's really play . 's much conﬂict interest , 's really much fact talked software automation , sometimes get people saying mean job ? right ? problem ? every time occurred , job created , fewer . happens shift people work . people sort plugging together thing could automate ? 's always sort value software . conversation scenario unlock ? use public cloud , lay staff ? rarely hear anything like . question growth rate business far server unit growth rate . help u break gap growth rate server unit growth rate ? ? - bob kelly q - kash rangan - bob kelly q - kash rangan - bob kelly thing . 'm glad asked question 's another important way think 's going microsoft 're thinking play . course last 18 month , fundamentally changed way license database os/management product . database always licensed per pc per box . ﬂip per core . o , went per box per cpu . ? virtualization core density , much power box . customer n't buy many box therefore n't monetizing eﬃciently . ﬂipping core cpu , actually able eﬃciently monetize fewer box common unit monetization across private cloud public cloud . two important part 're going market actually drive value . even shrinking hardware market , 're monetizing eﬃciently . second big thing 've done -- timing made transition ? well 12 -- 18 month . depends release 're talking . sql 's 18 month , ( inaudible ) window 10 month ago , okay ? second big thing happening 're seeing tremendous shift premium skus . combination density desire customer soak box longer . licensing packaging around premium skus shifting dollar per unit dramatically . 'm assuming rough map , 200,000 customer azure , $ 1 billion run rate . 's big amount money per customer work 5,000 box . 'm sure 's pretty big distribution customer spend lot money , lot le money . adoption cycle relative customer 's budget azure slotted ? would customer think spending money new project ? 'll answer second question first . 's absolutely new project . 's absolutely see dollar slowing . everyone 's carrying device around , every app get mobilized , . 's whole new set scenario coming apps . 's data bi huge scenario unlocked . customer saying new apps . 's first thing . q - kash rangan - bob kelly q - kash rangan - bob kelly q - kash rangan - bob kellythe second thing , look , early , early , early cycle transition $ 2 trillion . even take aws $ 2 billion take u whatever number want take u , 's still rounding error overall category . early cycle , 'll play long period time . 's material material . 's going take time u see burn . 'm surprised nobody asked rackspace . another infrastructure service company . , ( inaudible ) lead analyst stock . ever see rackspace contender enterprise ? well first , love rackspace . mean 're great company . really . reason think 're great company unique value prop , maniacal support . lot customer pay maniacal support full stop . n't technical capability , , software driven company like u . 's point . loyal customer base . penetration enterprise ? course . app scale advantage ? . n't cost structure , quite frankly think appetite . think 're real player , like . end day , would n't trade position . got . , insightful . thank much . good see product azure thank customer coming ( multiple speaker ) . thanks , everybody . appreciate . thank time presence well . great day . thank .
