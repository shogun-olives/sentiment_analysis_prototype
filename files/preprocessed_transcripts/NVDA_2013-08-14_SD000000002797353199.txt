guess , 'll go get started . 'll tee question , get thing started . maybe start talking core gpu business first , guess , nvidia took tremendous share gain , especially notebook past couple year . share , historic high , ﬂattish pc vertical -- basically , guess , ﬂattish pc vertical , grow business without additional share gain , share gain particularly kind stabilized ? 'd certainly go idea 're fairly high level historically business still got plenty growth potential actually . start , asp increasing . 're growing asp quite successfully . secondly , business growing . -- sorry , market growing well . figure suggest pc software market growing 10 % year . obviously grow along . pc gaming , pc gaming one funny market 's quite diﬃcult analyze intuitively 're going gain stock one organization . see little pc software shelf . something like 80 % pc gaming software revenue online , whether 's software 's bought online marketplace like steam whether 's downloads , online subscription warcraft increasingly 're seeing premium model , free play model people actually pay in-game purchase downloadable content . lot revenue happens almost invisibly 's actually quite diﬃcult track . organization tell u growing 10 % year map growth pc gaming hardware near estimate figure figure industry . rick schafer chris evendenso overall , whole market growing , asp growing . , interesting thing gpus generalize question gpu growth , course , 've got quadro tesla grid well . three way monetizing ip specifically gpu ip . quadro good business , growing probably rate market . -- well , according itc , 82 % unit share . estimate 90 % dollar share . anyway , grow growing market bunch minister place grow market . market grows recent data -- pmi data seem fairly positive encouraging fact . 're encouraged trajectory quadro . tesla well proving really interesting business ; 're probably familiar tesla , high-performance computing business . 's -- 's -- 've working , n't know , probably five year actually . really feel we're right place 're going get sort inﬂection point . gap always supporting enough code software application sort generally interesting developer . 've big -- despite installation like , example , oak ridge national lab 's installation ten million dollar revenue . background level smaller application quite small . q2 , saw q2 , hairsbreadth away new revenue record notable thing -- none large deal . actually background level application-driven purchase . that's encouraging number reason . firstly , 's sustainable , yes , sound like 's fair steady ( inaudible ) . secondly , 's much lowered hutch business big supercomputer installation . go primarily oems , 's basically researcher scientist sitting thinking , well , want molecular dynamic modeling . know nvidia accelerates code used . wanted accelerated tesla , rather go ibm say , test accelerated machine . -- ( inaudible ) le supercompute , -- ? . 's still supercomputing . 's necessarily -- 's like massive installation like oak ridge national lab 's guy department- level clustered university pharmaceutical company small -- small supercomputer well , probably come new name mini supercomputer something . -- 's -- side business huge , potentially huge . think 's driving appears right , scale much better way . 's great getting business like oak ridge national lab , marquee win , generate lot win well , lot people 're developing quota tight supercomputer , oak ridge national lab , 'll want develop test system . rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden rick schaferso generate lot business sense worth . they're diﬃcult scale . -- n't staff service 10 titan card win simultaneously whereas 100 small win , absolutely , ibm hp supermicro guy service . 's biggest gating factor supercompute ramp side business , software availability actually gating factor 's support , -- yes , okay , -- broad software support mean broad base engineer scientist actually go . 's longer debate -- longer introduce gpu acceleration people . ever considered gpu acceleration ? 's conversation . two year ago , 's certainly conversation probably follow-on , let help port code , right , whereas code ported , right . molecular dynamicist real job title , someone molecular dynamic , nova , vmd , namd , amber , code use application run accelerated gpus . okay . looked three year five year something new , 'm trying get sense big tesla could 've got ( inaudible ) sort stumbling block hurdle whatever want call sort way ? mean $ 1 billion kind business ( multiple speaker ) -- ? 's really diﬃcult value , 're different way something 's already done . think something like 10 million server year purchased would go parallel computing . think came $ 2 billion tam one could attack 'll get sense . yes , big business , think 's good growth trajectory . mean 'm encouraged -- good quarter q2 think kind ongoing year . order $ 200 million last year high end year probably . okay . , back gpu second , mean know biggest competitor discrete graphic space making noise recently potentially taking share year next desktop notebook , think . credible claim would -- would come think credible , mostly kind low-end desktop kind competing integrated graphic stuff -- ? chris evenden rick schafer share interesting ca n't get market share data . right ( inaudible ) publishes market share data data good . bear mind 's unit share dollar share , different 's ﬂat triangle like . look market , 's lot low value . lot - - look like significant share change think q3 last year , actually lost unit share gaining dollar share . could see opposite . thing remember data 's sell-in data well . ﬂuctuates lot quarter-to-quarter inventory getting channel . said , 's still data something look . would n't look q-by-q basis , would look annualized basis . actually , pay unfortunately market research data sell-out data , proprietary data actually ﬂat ( inaudible ) annual cycle cadence sell-in data . share gain . think amd done reasonably well cpu side thing recently certainly help gpu attach . otherwise think , reason mentioned , think share probably surprisingly high q1 like 68 % 65 % notebook probably risk share really honest term channel ﬂuctuation we're seeing . n't seem major reason share change hand , particularly balance year , think . visibility notebook design win , example . feel pretty good . n't think -- n't think share going change hand , particularly -- yes , skus change hand people like engage debate , oh , 've got sku 've lost sku . think get -- start getting level granularity , lose big picture . reason 'd expect share change hand , particularly . nobody particularly . mean , think 's notable last year lack pricing pressure space historically 've seen pricing pressure gpu , mean , seems like -- may 's skewed lower end . seen much . mean , guess , sound like 've kind predicted continuation pretty benign pricing environment mean anybody 's surprisingly robust . amd came market aggressive bundling strategy 've promoting . actually n't react pricing . anticipated would . n't react . actually little effect share despite reason act . 's pretty benign pricing environment . mean , 'll see go forward . 's much rational year , yes , actually 's good . good . lead gross margin question . mean , guy done great job expanding gross margin , think 400 basis point , 500 basis point , last four quarter , five quarter . math right , maybe five quarter six quarter . chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer yes . ( multiple speaker ) . , 'm curious , mean , sustainable level 're . -- think drove , know mix probably something . yes . lot factor . mean , 's good question lot factor . mean , previous peak gross margin think 46.3 % year ago recent climb . actually go back longer five quarter , go back probably two year , 've climbing . time amd weak product market strong . product okay , think product better . pc market well known fairly weak yet , 're 10 whole point higher previous record . 're right , 's mix , quadro grown lot , particularly since . ( inaudible ) profitable business u . mix within geforce actually . dynamic market changed , notebook weak , whole notebook market weak . notebook business smaller relative desktop gaming . pc gaming said strong business . 've got , profitable , healthy , growing business within pc market . n't know many company claim . whether 're semiconductor company hard drive company whoever , right , reality gaming , 's resilient business 's continuing grow successful . probably two ( main hour ) growing . , course , 's lot 've done term running business eﬃciently hood , reducing waste . thing like , simple thing , build chip , process catch faulty , 's ( costlier ) point . much catch many early , thing like . thing structural thing improved gross margin significantly time . asp business loss said . n't know obvious reason 's sustainable . absent obvious thing like price war thing hope would never happen . 's structural reason would n't continue . quadro continues grow , tesla growing quite strongly 's huge lift margin . grid lift margin start contribute meaningfully . ﬂip side , n't think netbook growing anytime soon , 'll probably ﬂat best . 's worst gross margin business . 're seeing structurally point margin maintained . , tegra grows , -- ? chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evendenthat next question , right . right . tegra chip business little bit copra average , massively . little bit -- ( inaudible ) handle gross margin . 's little bit lower corporate average . much lower . 's drag obviously . shield , small contributor price , 's obviously lower well . thing grow , 's still okay . yes . one thing note nvidia company know gm ( inaudible ) gm traditional way value semiconductor company , right . look gross margin trajectory 's buy 's sell . large part business development semiconductor , pure semiconductor . shield one , right , grid another , tesla another well . -- even quadra 're selling board , huge software component well . 's chip business traditional sense . business -- business grow , traditional way tracking gm using buy sell indicator probably le useful , -- sell , forecast -- sell 1 million share year , pull gross margin extremely good way , right , 've made awful lot money selling share . ( take nuance ) business think . right . since talking tegra , mean , guess , starting high level , 's great growth trajectory since guy introduced . always seems kind fall little short expectation . mean , given year -- know year particular struggle first half . guess , 'm curious , -- like piece puzzle 's missed , mean , 's like gaining full suite like connectivity piece puzzle help sell 're relatively new channel , historically big player ? rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden ( multiple speaker ) actually . think one miss tend -- 've done ( inaudible ) expectation , think set expectation highly , look last year -- mentioned chip business new gp -- new tegra fsc like reporting segment , $ 540 million $ 760 million . let 's take first $ 540 million , 's $ 0.5 billion business 's good business , 's extremely good business . , 'll continue ramp . year diﬃcult year certainly revenue change year put politically correct way . 's result couple diﬃcult decision made last year . made conscious decision take resource away tegra 4 put tegra -- project logan tegra 4i . knowing tegra 4 going right place win key tablet win year , 's going . knew hit hot revenue year . felt right thing long-term perspective . , 've got project logan demoed siggraph . know 's running much aggressive time scale tegra 4 . chip right place win key -- key tablet win . see -- could see revenue certainly early first half next year . put great place . tegra 4i mainstream smartphone chip , like . integrated modem -- 's going qualification , 's progressing fine . going process . ready product first half next year well . really sampling trial ? 's sampling already . okay . 's something since february . 's -- happened call . way process worked , phone manufacturer actually build phone chip deciding whether want actually buy . that's happening , parallel , 're getting chip qualified carrier effectively chip level phone handset oem take phone build decided want take market , start qualifying device-level qualification well bring market . 's lengthy process , right . chip start sampling ( mid ) february . 's least rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evendena year product get market , aspect . least sometime 's next year hopefully . okay . production risk ( multiple speaker ) . back half year , mean tegra 4 finally available device . 're starting ship hp , toshiba , couple others . fact , tegra 3 device started shipping 149 7-inch tablet wal-mart hisense . could good volume runner well . number product , 'll back half year see well . yes . saw company yesterday ( primarily ) sale china based made claim believe half tablet unit anyway next year could produced sort white box market n't know , kind bless basically white box market tablet could bigger samsung apple combined . yes , ( fact , ) number going big , 's certainly large number analyst , least unit , think 're speaking unit ? ( multiple speaker ) . yes . find way -- find way found way hitting competitive price point tegra 4 well . certainly service market yes , 's diﬃcult ( audible ) . 's certainly many ten million unit bunch sale strategy address scalable way , obviously , 's spread something like 100 200 different manufacturer actually . find -- clearly , , ( ca n't ) sale engineering team . ( inaudible ) . rick schafer chris evenden rick schafer chris evenden ( inaudible ) , okay . number recently read 100 , 200. yes , thousand impossible . impression consolidating somewhat . going direction . whatever , hundred oems . find scalable way address various strategy place . historically , 've strong . ( obviously , cited ) white-box , n't know thought share -- share would kind market . know ( that's ) tougher question ( multiple speaker ) . yes , share , need grow business share becomes useful metric u , think . mean moment , design win metric look business , know talked tegra little slightly corporate average . mean would kind business let 's say n't take , would create bigger drag would way cost offset ? business took , would drag . ( multiple speaker ) . address , 'll find way addressing profitably . three 's point going business chip margin going 30 % something . would n't take n't really profitable . mean -- company compete price feature performance . however , price always part equation . find way adding feature way increase cost -- example , directstylus feature announced -- well , couple month ago , actually allows add stylus , small bom cost opposed . estimate galaxy note , stylus technology , cost $ 20 fraction . thing like share saving , like manufacturer , mean still command premium tegra we've got extra value still hit good bom cost device . would way ( ever ) discussed internally potentially couple biggest tablet , smartphone guy , smartphone -- apple samsung ( ) , two guy obviously sort -- feel like kind core guy stuff think 've done lot innovation mentioned one thing right stylus . would ever able go license apple know mean get revenue way . rick schafer chris evendenwe 'd love . yes . absolutely . mean . licensing business . 've formalized technology . 've kept design way make licensable call . ( future course ) maxwell similarly licensable . clearly , love one bigger manufacturer like apple samsung license technology . 'll ( fairly ) talking try raise , think -- , command premium term technology 've put gpu come investment 've put r & . look competitor , imagination technology clearly make $ 200 million year . devoted half r & , $ 100 million gpu r & year , right . spend north $ 1 billion year r & . pretty good gpu result . mean reality feature , performance , performance per watt . performance per millimeter square . last one particularly interesting debate , licensing technology , command premium licensing core , save customer money foundry , level performance , 's smaller piece silicon . , , share saving customer give u premium core , right . -- business early day 's still lot 'll . could quite interesting , yes . well mentioned r & , 'm curious , mean , talk tegra print , mean , would assume 're spending outsized proportion r & development particular vertical versus -- outsized meaning bigger ( ) % rev . yes , 's interesting look , way allocating cost we've come way report auditor happy one thing talked analyst day took tegra together , much would save r & ? number actually smaller amount ( get covered allocate ) , actually lot synergy business . kepler cost originally geforce call . -- geforce work low power , mean , low power extremely important even geforce ; fact , would say everywhere 're power constrained , ( gentle way ) say performance per watt performance 's every single one business , 're power constrained . even supercomputing business , limit much power put server , server box server rack . limit . data center actually constrained amount power actually get , big cable go inside , like , 's constraint . much performance get megawatt ( 're throwing side placement ) . everything power constrained . mean power consumption important , whether 're developing tegra chip whether 're developing geforce chip . synergy mean gpu rick schafer chris evenden q - rick schafer q - unidentified participant - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evendenarchitecture , process technology , stuff mean incremental cost tegra actually lower report way . make tegra . yes , work together , think 's way -- 's another way monetizing ip already , two chip , gpu soc monetize bunch way across bunch different market . okay . guess last question , since mentioned server , know past , said like going micro-server space , yes , might first area focus . think changed -- ? never say never first answer . secondly , offering data center high-performance compute , 's differentiation . right , 're looking general performance , general computing server like hadoop server something like , 's would add value . see u high-performance computing application computer everything . see u big data application like ( shavan ) well . 's really back end , 's computer application . make lot sense well . general purpose like dense server , 'll leave amcc amd calxeda cavium -- intel well . mean that's going -- 's really quite competitive market , think . let 's stick really strong differentiator market way . question answer okay . think 've got five minute question anybody got anything . 'm sorry talked already . plain-old desk computer . geforce business , yes . market , 's going kind attach rate , market share pc unit growth 's , general , think outlook ? yes . address right beginning actually . q - unidentified participant - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evenden q - unidentified participantsorry , n't . really brieﬂy , pc market diﬃcult market , pc gaming great market . franchise 've built pc gaming , market -- pc gaming whole probably grows 10 % year . 've built strong franchise pc gaming allows u build -- continue grow profitable business . fact , actually extend strategy mobile well , 's one point n't make earlier . thing like -- could -- build similarly defensible , profitable , mean , calling niche sound funny , big niche . 's effectively , right . gaming niche inside pc market base completely differently rest pc market something strong profitable position . , well mobile market , successful u . device like shield initiative like grid traditional product base like geforce , work together . took ( ) earnings call brieﬂy , 's lot synergy . build profitable franchise . ( inaudible ) attach rate discrete gpus holding constant , rising going ? , see unit dropping 10 % think year ? yes . respect 's trend asp . separate mobile . okay . answer really quickly . attach rate approximately ﬂat . , pc gaming growing , right . notebook shrinking . pc gaming -- desktop gaming growing 10 % year . know 's third question forgotten . share asp . share asp . share moment probably pretty stable ; asp growing . okay . net-net , business grows ? - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evenden think grow , gpu business -- desktop grow quite nicely , notebook probably whole market . 's gaming well , right , thing drive purchasing notebook gpus driven oem 's desire differentiate laptop . 's different mechanic market . thanks . talk decision license ip graphic instead chip . 's instead , 's well . well , yes , addition , sorry , , decide ? 's revenue opportunity , 's getting le dollar obviously higher gross profit . , maybe ca n't tegras everything . still want proliferate graphic ? yes . last point key one . place ca n't -- wo n't take tegra . still bring value ip . company chosen strong reason ideological reason want build chip , extremely strong graphic ip portfolio mentioned earlier thousand pound extremely good cause well . address market way . 's vertically integrated oem one obvious market . -- new market set-top box smart tv n't resource go . company could really benefit stronger -- marquee client started 's test comp ? yes . 's -- short answer . n't expect u announce necessarily soon , depends customer would want . get client today , would want say , oh , 're going client nvidia , think answer probably . probably want keep we're ready launch , would like think would see competitive advantage device 're producing gpu , weight gpu . might see . -- customer tomorrow license chip , code , would build chip code , would take chip , put device bring device market . could two year even ask someone tomorrow could raising ( inaudible ) could two year hear . q - unidentified participant - chris evenden q - rick schafer - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evendenis likely similar model imagination like $ 0.30 -- forgot 're like $ 0.30 chip something also upfront license fee , similar like arm ? would n't want talk model . mean , allude previous conversation rick mentioned , think command premium save money foundry . 's way ( mint ) money result . ( ) royalty kind thing , license royalty kind thing ? yes , likely , mean . , depends business financial license , customer want think price . ( inaudible ; microphone inaccessible ) . workstation business -- question , 's workstation business growing ? workstation business showing strong growth last couple quarter . -- guess mentioned earlier , 82 % market share according idc . estimate 90 % dollar share . diﬃcult grow business without growing whole market number initiative place like maximus grow market grid actually , grow market vca vgx . outside , market data fairly promising . 80 % revenue driven manufacturing . pmi data good , auto manufacturing data good . 'll see go . grid point , announced year 're supported natively xendesktop 7. mean anyone considering citrix implementation today also look effect gpus hardware see benefit . 's much easier . , becomes self-supporting initiative software supported automatically , 've working bunch citrix ( star ) 150 trial place think 12 dozen var working active engagement . , 's longer-term thing typical project implementation 12-month 24-month proposition . , early indicator pretty good . vmware show later month think actually 're working closely well get supported natively way supported natively citrix . 's another growth initiative quadro . q - rick schafer - chris evenden q - rick schafer - chris evenden great . 's perfect time right . thanks lot chris coming . okay . thanks . thanks giving u time . appreciate . thanks , rick .
