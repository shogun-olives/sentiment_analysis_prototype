's always right market u , executing well , taking share , think 's successful right , plan , get overly focused quarter half year change . think next decade . u sort sit say bigger smaller piece gdp , matter number . absolutely believe larger percentage gdp next decade today . 's true , well positioned growth , matter 's pacing quarter-to-quarter tends look world term demand . conversation 're customer really reﬂect . second half question , specifically covid-19 . think really think adjustment , 've made pretty narrow supply chain , said guidance quarter . focus primarily day day health safety employee , partner , customer community operate . u really first priority watching pace supply chain recovery continue others continue keep eye . got . want drill , talked helping enterprise transformation digital transformation . think , oftentimes , focus narrowly cloud side equation . always want azure number . 've talking u long time , saying listen , 've got look bigger picture , really hybrid cloud , satya said thing u . last year think started see spade hybrid cloud advantage really becoming big driver business . talk u customer viewing ? customer conversation go term hybrid cloud opportunity versus cloud opportunity ? number one , expand tam ? create expansive market opportunity , think hybrid perspective ? yeah , think maybe start top . reality compute need exist edge cloud , think call generally hybrid , think , reality people beginning see , 've architected way beginning talking advantage also beginning . feel recent announcement , 've made make real people . talk importance latency sovereignty privacy security . term portfolio customer think . u azure `` part business '' . 're right , number u best seen server cloud product kpi . 've talked keith wei amy e. hood keith wei amy e. hoodlong time know people really focus one , think customer asking customer contracting they're trying achieve . 's far similar kpi . way , think mentioned hybrid benefit . way 've talked we're starting see think mentioned earnings call one-third customer benefit starting use azure . think , 's really like funnel , funnel opportunity u customer , already committed platform . convert help start project successful azure cost effective cloud platform . believe going forward opportunity u beginning . sort reinforces tend focus server cloud product kpi , know everybody pick favorite one . got . shift -- people start use hybrid cloud identity credit 've purchased , investor worried drag serving tool line people start kind shifting consumption towards azure myopically focused bigger picture serving tool ? suspect know answer one answered . 's tend believe view trying get specific number , specific quarter say , server on-prem number go azure number go . large drag probably getting little myopic term overall trend line , overall cloud opportunity represented on-prem hybrid azure continuing show growth execution feel good term explosive tam market opportunity within tam . , probably would say , 's probably also nature view longer period time get hung couple point . especially 606 , add volatility on-prem number tend focused opposed overall booking consumption growth . okay . got . speaking -- think hybrid story microsoft . one big benefit , see real competitive differentiation versus mega scale cloud player like aws gcp . much translates sort reality see ground ? much competitive advantage ? really strong story side equation cloud on-premise environment ? cloud vendor starting make inroad competitive environment . becoming fuller story via partnership new product , on-premise environment ? keith wei amy e. hood keith wei amy e. hoodi think , incredibly competitive market long time 'm sure would characterize different 's always incredibly competitive market large , well-funded competitor . think general , advantage talked hybrid advantage . 's also unique attribute azure cloud differentiated arc sentinel . lot example example stack synapse , go list . 's also real advantage term focus enterprise sale force 'm incredibly proud execution , global presence , focus location data center . far journey term global presence matter global company , local company . would add , think 've done nice job making easier company make choice commitment u . also think fullness commercial cloud offering matter . 's azure , example , 's conversation , 're able customer around total digital transformation workload solution stem across microsoft 365 dynamic well azure term really mattering customer relevance adding industry layer feel quite good . got . think azure growth driving growth . think side sense perspective primarily kind workload driven , people moving public cloud , starting use lower level service computing , storage whatnot . 're trying ass , degree adoption higher level service sort asp side equation , start impact equation start bolster growth . kind help , could give u sort understanding equation term workload growth versus arpu growth , , unit . yes , think talked bit past couple quarter , believe , term growth would call premium service . best way , lot , think premium service tend attribute rate 's higher arpu . tend also higher margin , margin come differentiation course see one core driver especially iaa paas growth course past quarter . consumption based -- happens 's used , right , opposed simply contracted . think feel quite good momentum premium service particular . premium service particular would point real hit , . keith wei amy e. hood keith wei amy e. hood keith wei amy e. hoodright , think looked across data story place would , particular , highlight great progress past year . think 're pretty excited next year offer . got . one last question azure , 'll go rest product portfolio . 'm excited , many thing talk . well , double-booked two keynote row , 'll hit -- first one apparently azure , great . , 'm going come back margin . term overall cloud gross margin , guy seen remarkable improvement really nice trend line . drill kind azure side equation . 've talk u lot sort scaling equation . scale , 're going get better better margin . much room left , particularly think consumption side business . sort redmond talking technically oriented guy , really excited ability drive eﬃciencies power cooling cpu eﬃciencies whatnot . side equation , like 're saying premium service come higher gross margin . think ability gross margin continue improving go-forward basis . feeling n't hurt called people technical . answer question anyway , , 're right , couple mechanism improve commercial cloud gross margin specifically talk azure question . 're right , see number factor improve . talk power cooling . talk design data center , could talk chip , could talk many level eﬃciency technical side putting hardware eﬃciencies also software improvement take advantage hardware improvement . still feel like opportunity team walked make improvement front . addition , course azure , keith wei amy e. hoodcontinue see premium service become larger portion mix , also provides opportunity . overall , think would call sort core azure iaa paas consumption . still room gross margin improvement 're still focused making happen . although time , course get harder harder improvement . get closer , would say 's ideal state . okay . analyst , one interesting thing 'm always looking area story company talking lot , investor n't . trying explore gaap . microsoft 365 think one area every conversation management microsoft . microsoft 365 come lot . never come investor conversation . help u understand microsoft 365 motion , sort cement stronger kind deep relationship customer , maybe help audience , like . yeah , actually think part lack conversation investor community course , community , course , , many way fault . talk lot component kpis 's really kpi point say microsoft 365 x. n't give mechanism discussion . , consider good feedback really consider make transparent opportunity . really microsoft 365 solution take brings together . oﬃce 365 , em story , well window commercial .

's security compliance . underpinning , course , identity . , u , think 's pretty broad view opportunity help customer space . got . drilling little bit oﬃce 365 particular commercial side oﬃce 365. guy spoken 200 million monthly active oﬃce 365 user . think relation original base , guy set big commercial base . pretty far opportunity definitely pas 50 % point , get investor worry . always worry back half slope . offset , obviously arpu one offset f1 sku ability expand tam sort lower price sku helped user growth lot . investor think p q , oﬃce 365. still lot opportunity expand base sort keep user count growing well going-forward basis shifting focus mostly towards arpu expansion sort e3 e5 sku m5 sku microsoft 365 ? keith wei amy e. hood keith weisslet try simplify bit code name use skus bit . say , thinking internally opportunity still clearly seeing opportunity number opportunity grow installed base well opportunity grow . think , moved long way , would say , initial view moving existing customer towards future . really think 's way impressive point 've actually grown installed base time . lot way happened brought frontline worker skus . really people never touched product . would say 's something learn time would say wait , mobile opportunity . lot mobile opportunity , also beyond term work environment bring benefit worker whether sit every day large pc desktop unit whether work environment intermittent experience ambient computing . u , continue invest building installed base . see even product brought market recently , whether think team really mobile first experience . whether think oﬃce app people see integrated experience many phone . think 'll see continue place see opportunity . arpu , 're right , bunch lever help u grow tend think movement skus , whether 's one three five whether moving people oﬃce inclusive opportunity microsoft 365 , remain , think , good opportunity u . would say 've -- 've good execution year . particular , microsoft 365 e5 sku offer lot opportunity analytics security endpoint . got . investor , think power platform ? power platform fundamentally extension oﬃce 365 story like , think extension azure story , 's lot different component . 's kind low-code , 's automation . perspective oﬃcer 365 side really meant expand oﬃce worker could . interesting . tend think . -- see logic . u almost standalone . okay . amy e. hood keith wei amy e. hood many reason mentioned , really brings together low-code , no- code , rpa self-service bi analytics . think , 's got fairly unique position across portfolio term asset brings together . course relationship azure term starting creating usage application built . absolutely extends people felt build solve business process , problem , opportunity . 's 'm sure thread 're pulling oﬃce term brings relevance another opportunity u engage type worker historically associated oﬃce 365 microsoft 365. quite different term solving problem . course relates dynamic . dynamic really fundamentally addressing think 's early part curve reinventing business process work today vast amount data available cost-effective manner . see particular maybe company , would see large opportunity , something 's quite nascent early 's cycle development also really something brings together piece commercial cloud extends , opportunity see quite early cycle . got . think 's great segue dynamic 365. think investor think dynamic offering crm context . think lot people overlook , really broad portfolio solution rigor entire suite onto azure platform . excess $ 2.5 billion business , growing pretty good clip . 's real saas business . still , get question investor like one microsoft , going get real . 's progress dynamic 've seen thus far . 's kind path making bigger part microsoft story going forward basis . yes , one , 50 % business already cloud-based , think people probably n't always realize term business . 're right , far sale cloud workload , go far beyond . term module capability , 's -- think probably one , leader term ai enablement application due modern platform upon work . ability take account , many asset company order make world leading . 's place spent year investing lot sale capacity , 're excited 're excited many people joined company order make reality global basis term meeting demand . place , think 're early part cycle term reinventing business process look like next decade . certainly place think optimism remains high . see dynamic 365 growth accelerate q2 larger base business feel like 's part , due engineering keith wei amy e. hood keith wei amy e. hoodwork product quality , also increasing focus term sale execution . got . one last sort product division , want make sure touched . window side equation . think window oem particular covid- 19 , lot investor anxiety end life window 7 support thinking sort demand ahead curve , exploration demand back side . -- look analog would sort window xp . one good analog look term sort strength window coming , strength window going looking different template window oem trend . think general , cycle tend look similar , would say one certainly complicated number thing 'll talk second . different . still remains quite bit opportunity , saw point prior cycle . lot exists , would expect exist , small medium business segment . unusual , mean room continue grow likely mean curve look different last time term shape . , add two complicating factor , one brought , chip supply , impacted growth rate past fit second one , supply chain . currently , china term binding production . -- 've talked impact quarterly result . 'm sure look like exact curve term prior cycle , little bit left go . prior cycle , also 's bit volatile due two issue work . got . bringing broader kind gross margin discussion . calendar '19 , saw really nice expansion overall gross margin throughout year . one investor concern lot tailwind become headwind spread , product cycle around window xp , window xp obviously , really high-risk margin . product cycle around window server sql server sort good tailwind guy . prior year , high gross margin business , data away . reverse side equation , new surface product coming , lower gross margin . really xbox big one people worried back half year , 's going new console cycle could depress gross margin . investor framing like gross margin expansion potential calendar 20 versus calendar '19 . keith wei amy e. hood keith weissthere two thing 'll walk . think 've mentioned number walk technically impact margin . step backwards second , term maybe , management team -- microsoft , think . tends quite different nature question , 're excited launching world 's powerful console holiday xbox series x. 're excited launching console good lifetime value associated term roi . term mean opportunity see gaming really bring together content community cloud go-forward basis . look say , well , 's exciting time company leader opportunity market we're excited committed . fact initial year console launch n't help gross margin . something take account , think funding gaming business think , importance microsoft . yes , technically , next year , launch console , impact gross margin higher revenue growth segment , console launch . separately , think impact selling high margin quarter recognition product , thing like oem window sql server . 's somewhat similar logic , feel great , 're executing well end support build great funnel u , think transition cloud customer helping hybrid journey . create headwind u , time , tend focus gross margin execution product mean , building driving effective execution product gm . mix simply by-product execution timeline . thought especially good gross margin product execution . whether 're talking cloud , whether 're talking on-prem product , whether 're talking gaming responsibility leader shown make happen . , think 're right . pick right mix create headwind percentage optimism term cash ﬂow generation actually dollar growth probably , would frame think . got . one last one , 'm going open audience couple last question . opex side equation , past four year , we've executed extremely well growing opex radar u gross profit dollar growth , focused . yeah . thank . amy e. hood keith wei amy e. hood keith weissand lot come shifting investment lower productivity area investment area yield durable time . still room within sort microsoft motion . still sort keep pace opex growth gross profit dollar growth . well , think 've obviously seen u accelerate opex growth 've seen opportunity feel like opportunity good revenue profit growth . n't really think solving number , think solving opportunity 're well positioned execute tends think allocating dollar every day . think way really mark healthy discussion healthy leadership team ability look say , gosh , better way execute , 're executing . merge team , move resource part every day conversation 's led finance , led right conversation . think 're seeing , whether 's thought building azure time 've thought sharing resource investment 've done ai across different group . lot shared resourcing , put great leader together innovate faster . , 's much positive culture statement around innovating customer solution mind best way , far guide , think investment think people may realized landing right best ability achieve high roi solving number something tend way . , feel good execution ; growth opportunity , market broadly u . got .
