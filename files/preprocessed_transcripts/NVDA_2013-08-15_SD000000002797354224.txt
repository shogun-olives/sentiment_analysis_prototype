welcome canaccord genuity 's 33rd annual global growth conference . name bobby burleson , analyst canaccord genuity . happy nvidia today join u fireside chat . director investor relation , chris evenden nvidia go ahead kick . hi , chris . thanks , bobby . probably high level people maybe n't following closely development nvidia past couple year , kind refresh u high level term company would describe company someone coming ? sure , sure . think visual computing company mean technology , hardware software , improve visual experience customer variety technology form factor . come originally pc space build graphic card pc mostly used gamers expanded market build big defensible , profitable segment pc space . looking expand mobile computing well . pc side thing , core always gamers . brand called geforce service gamers . playing 3d game pc almost certainly using graphic card two three . probably using one . use technology enter professional visualization space brand call quadro . actually chip significantly different software top . look movie cgi , pretty much , oscar nomination year run -- special effect nomination hardware . one guy run business like say ﬂoats , drive ﬂies , designed quadro well . cad/cam actually biggest segment business , drive 80 % revenue . also gpus call , graphical processing unit , got powerful became general purpose , could actually use processing unit right thing graphic . brand called tesla take gpus sell supercomputing application . supercomputing , could anything world 's powerful supercomputer actually 18,000 gpus providing compute power department level even single workstation one card simulation work engineer desk , . taking lot learning business moving mobile brand called tegra soc , system-on-chip , essentially multimedia computer single piece silicon building business android tablet phone . recently started growing automotive business . automotive business talk later perhaps . attractive business . drive nav system dvd system inside car launched gaming device well actually another way monetizing r & ip put mobile graphic . also looking license mobile graphic core segment market ca n't access chip . example , going try imply customer point give illustrative example , apple , example build chip going buy chip u . may well point one license gpu believe quite markedly superior gpu technology . also licensing gpu technology get market bandwidth address directly like smart tv example . lot opportunity . people putting intelligence tv hotel earlier week tv essentially almost completely lacked bobby burleson chris evendeninteractivity . delay anything program guide . unbelievable . sort user experience fix quite inexpensively . . think company right , powerful franchise pc market . mean thinking day n't know many component company look right -- bobby perhaps answer -- actually successful profitable growing business pc market . mean maybe ﬂash guy apart , can't think anyone say . trying replicate sort ecosystem mobile computing space well . mobile computing competitive space well obviously . lot -- one company particular extremely powerful . lot competition space able carve segment defensible profitable like gaming segment pc market . really brings next question legacy marriage nvidia pc market thing happening term cannibalization tablet low-end general stagnation . yet nvidia seems slice pc market healthy gross profit growth . explain nvidia actually position within pc ? yes . think one interesting way split -- people take homogenous view pc market . maybe think high-end low- end rarely get sophisticated . way think pc market think specialty pc general-purpose pc . specialty pc pc someone need specific purpose . whether design wing next jumbo jet create special effect play game , device buy need , desire something specific . whereas general-purpose pc vast majority market frankly pc buy need pc survive adult 21st century . need email , need surf web , need update facebook page forth . segment market use case , tablet generally better solution think consumer realizing right n't need pc . need device email , surf web forth . section market tremendous pressure right whereas specialty pc people need specific reason . going give unwillingly prepared pay premium performance , feature stability thing provide , value add . bobby burleson chris evenden bobby burleson chris evendeni trying think good metaphor best one come come better one , ( inaudible ) think one . rather like difference sit telly dinner switch like veg watch whatever happens . general- purpose pc opposed 9 pm sunday night game throne . first case , anyone phone say want go pub almost anything pull away application tv , right , , like background thing . whereas said meet pub 9.30 sunday evening , , watching game throne . specific purpose , real need , perceived need . trying trivialize need . gamers need pc . desire like engineer designer need purpose . difference market see . business lower end lower asp , lower margin common largely notebook actually common rest notebook market pressure . gaming gpu workstation gpus simulation , tesla business higher end , actually growing . every single one three business growing . desktop -- desktop consumer pc u growth market 10 % year . quadro growing rate manufacturing gdp pretty encouraging data recently . tesla growth business . much smaller base growing ten % sort 40 % , something like . great . growth business . different common perception pc conversation constantly people actually . let 's talk something growing year , tegra . yes . -- . bobby burleson chris evenden bobby burleson chris evenden mean guess topic , look like perhaps ﬂattish year tegra . still requires nice uptick second half . talk driving term -- well kind call ﬂat . going . jen-hsun talked earnings call $ 200 million $ 300 million base like $ 760 million . significantly ( multiple speaker ) ( multiple speaker ) $ 500 million year ? yes . reason -- tegra last year android phone tablet business also window rt device well surface two device . go generation tegra chip , tegra 1 , tegra 2 , tegra 3 , tegra 3 , tegra 4 , tegra 5. big gap tegra 3 tegra 4. tegra 4 late made hard decision last year actually take effort away tegra 4 despite fact already late felt could see going diﬃcult year n't want actually risk following year chasing something never going happen year . put design effort chip integrated baseband modem called tegra 4i next generation tegra called project logan . result , tegra 4 -- timing wrong big tablet win , amazon google tablet . also market n't evolve quite way -- knew . thing unexpected market n't evolve quite way expected . thought android tablet market would diverse course sale concentrated two largely . window rt successful expected hoped . powerful position ecosystem window rt . lot important design slot last generation future generation . thing lead fairly significant miss expectation beginning year . said , disentangle revenue challenge year technical position , strategic position , feel pretty good . whereas essentially two-year gap tegra 3 tegra 4 , going something like nine 10 month gap tegra 4 q - unidentified participant - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evenden q - bobby burleson - chris evendenand tegra 5 already started sampling project logan . could see product market first half next year certainly perhaps early q1 . conceivably could quick . timing also good amazon google tablet bet sharing aggressively . think know company need think got best chip market software support around . think go . tegra 4i modem qualification right carrier qualification right done end year . progressing -- happened . sorry got question ? question answer ( inaudible ; microphone inaccessible ) right . -- ( technical diﬃculty ) . question amazon google lose win back ? nexus 7 last year , displaced qualcomm year . kindle fire omap texas instrument ti declared leaving market . seems unlikely next year . ? mean guess part question stay involved market ? clearly think growth coming . kill tegra obviously planning . talked tablet potential . mentioned development side modem . tegra 4i , talk little bit smartphone potential business , maybe next year going forward ? well talk generally first . general point opposed last year android phone tablet one chip , tegra 3 , next year looking android phone tablet , window rt well likely smaller , automotive great business u . going q - bobby burleson - chris evenden q - bobby burleson - chris evendenorder $ 100 million year . $ 200 million next year , $ 400 million year $ 450 million . mean great thing automotive business long product cycle . booked already . . going variety device like one announced far ouya like game console sort opportunity game console set-top box like . going bunch device like support business . bunch new market . well bunch new market supporting business broader base , product lineup first time . tegra 3 , tegra 4. tegra 5 early . tegra 4i , integrated modem i500 , discrete baseband modem well . got much stronger base . oh . got shield well , handheld gaming device . thing broaden base also help u focus strategy building gaming franchise tablet phone mobile gaming general whatever form whether box plug tv whether handheld gaming device whether phone tablet . great . another thing come typically talk moving traditional compute platform mobile computing , 's asp degradation happens . first cpu vendor potentially going traditional discrete gpu tegra ( multiple speaker ) 's good question . happens gross margin ? seems like performing pretty well . continue keep healthy level -- incorporate understanding tegra gpu business since process ? okay , answer . going make general point margin actually know margin tend sort like go-to data point valuing semiconductor company like deciding buy sell semiconductor company . le le chip company . even geforce business , large part value provided software put around effort put game developer ensure use latest feature hardware , q - bobby burleson - chris evendenlooked good possibly could , ran fast possibly could . lot effort lot value put around chip . -- component business distribution business sell distribution arrow whoever sell . one important point . term answer direct question gross margin , much higher gross margin five year ago . mean previous record 46 point . 56. previous record competition extremely weak market extremely strong . neither thing true today . reason structurally changed . gpu business anymore . quadro tesla high gross margin business pulling . also market within geforce changing well . notebook market decline desktop market continues strong , thing actually lift gross margin notebook weakest business margin percentage standpoint . , tegra slightly corporate average moment . grows , quote -- air quote -- hurt gross margin . said , okay tegra growing going help operating margin earnings . , changing nature business delivering . mean particularly shield going -- end-user device , right . making 55 point margin device surprised hear . sell lot , make awful lot money think everyone happy . pull headline gross margin . long rambling answer let summarize . structurally sort mid-50s margin company right . obvious reason term structural reason margin would reduce except tegra grows . structural reason would cause margin reduce . good thing . noise signal product launch product end life overall structurally mid-50s company growth business slightly mid-50s . increase earnings grows . heard say competition one point answer lot talk market share core sort gpu business amd making -- primarily amd making statement . curious take market share high level obviously -- sure . q - bobby burleson - chris evenden q - bobby burleson q - unidentified participant - chris evenden guy reside . outlook prospect market share ? short answer would -- going enjoy revisiting statement market share gain six month time think overly aggressive . 65 point market share discrete graphic noise competitor getting share . certainly notebook side visibility design win-based business , think going well better haswell done ivy bridge depending volume implies market share ﬂat . desktop side , seems pretty good well . market share number went little bit quarter . -- note , slight note market share number . data good . market share number data unit number dollar almost profit generated top pyramid . see pretty significant market share shift money actually going opposite direction . like q3 last year lost market share gained dollar share example . continued happen . treat note caution . also sell-in number , also channel artifact people launching new product ﬂushing channel whatever -- implying anyone managing . saying nature business . look year think 'll see pretty stable like 65 % feel good level . desktop , , competitive . interesting take fine-grained view , everyone fighting tooth nail every single design win aggressive head-to-head battle . step back certain distance suddenly quite peaceful market share actually stable . dynamic -- appears dynamic equilibrium right like . great . five minute -- figure maybe would open generally question . would better haswell ivy bridge ? would -- statement gm business belief design win know slot , right . know q - unidentified participant - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evendenhow many opportunity . believe least many last generation . would better ? tight focus performance per watt right . jen-hsun , ceo , like say performance per watt performance pretty much every environment operate cellphone supercomputer power constrained . extremely good performance per watt extremely important notebook obviously . talk dynamic nvidia versus ( inaudible ) ? mean ( inaudible ) . think -- right try nice . question attach rate . percentage pc ship discrete graphic discrete graphic 10 year entire time , every time intel come new integrated graphic , year different , year entry- level graphic business dy intel got really good graphic whether g35 , supposedly dx10 n't . g45 , actually dx10 whether like 945g , 965g whether sandy bridge ivy bridge haswell , every single generation . feel point burden proof statement transfer accuser away u every single time last 10 year happened , always statement always wrong . ? . go back description market , specialty pc versus general purpose pc , specialty pc , guy need discrete graphic . intel integrated graphic perfectly fine playing last year's game low resolution setting turned minimum . last year , five year ago next year . sit market graphic get better , game get heavier , graphic get better . gamer ever use intel integrated graphic . part market general-purpose pc notebook , reason people buy graphic slightly different . offer oems way differentiate notebook . oem obviously n't want sell entry- level notebook . want sell people part upsell -- justify extra price , right ? part upsell core i3 , core i5 , core i7 q - bobby burleson - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evenden q - bobby burleson - chris evendenladder people climb . part discrete graphic versus discrete graphic . always better without , right ? car turbocharged engine , car normally aspirated engine . say benefit n't accrue discrete graphic . benefit real point trying make decision consumer based graphic performance . would n't know 3d mark number came hit eye . n't even know 3d mark . standard benchmark graphic . graphic thing . intel 's argument oh , graphic getting better therefore take business away specious buying decision based . pressure attach rate level different . thing like bond cost pressure , introduction touch -- impact higher dram price example ? seeing ( multiple speaker ) -- sort thing could pressure attach rate . sure attach rate go year , intel point improved graphic performance haswell . go , n't know whether , bond pressure push graphic performance dynamic marketplace . moment discrete graphic defines premium notebook . point future touch defines premium notebook , might put pressure attach rate see . graphic performance put pressure attach rate . answer question ? sure . long got ? think done . maybe take rest line . sure , thanks bobby . q - bobby burleson thank .
