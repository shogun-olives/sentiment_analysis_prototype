hi , everybody , good afternoon good evening . thanks attending discussion comparing [ ph ] future mobility . 's pleasure welcome , ali . nvidia 's vice president general manager automotive business , automotive product line . overseeing product engineering marketing , also drive end-to-end platform nvidia developing introduced automotive industry year . , ali going give u like quick presentation like intro perspective , q & . always , want pas straight q & , feel free email question 'll best introduce -- integrate ﬂow question 'll ask ali . ali , , thanks lot joining ﬂoor . hi , everyone . ? pleasure today talk guy nvidia 's automotive product strategy . 'm going jump sort say guy know everything 're talking today subject disclosure forward-looking statement . financial statement , talk risk uncertainty provides detail within . 'm going jump talk nvidia 's strategy . slide really cornerstone make nvidia unique automotive instead , we're providing product service support partner automotive ecosystem sort say end-to-end . mean people need design car nvidia solution help customer design car , train ai model , simulate av stack . use drive omniverse help customer build automotive factory -- design automotive factory , also build retail configurator . engineering side , use omniverse help people synthetic data generation , sort augment data real ﬂeet synthetic data av product better . 's sort set u apart . 's -- 're sort -- 're actually selling chip car go build . 're selling end-to-end platform development partner . 're always thinking make easier partner develop end-to-end requirement create tool software service accelerate ﬂow . 've said many time , company best development ﬂow , fastest company successful automotive 's hard build sort level 4 level 5 software build sort concierge experience inside car , ai know everything , know everything car sort talk sort build end time framework . make lifecycle better , better customer , differentiated nvidia versus player system . kind show think ecosystem . 's like oems say , oh , oem . want work entire ecosystem , software company building av software . 'm showing slide , point nvidia designed best platform anyone build self-driving software platform . take learning development guy know , also build av software cockpit software . many partner building av software cockpit software platform take learning entire ecosystem put platform industry , share benefit . thing simulation . simulation option . n't drive sim . drive sim actually apis entire validation ecosystem , hook platform accelerate intent development cycle . thing notice 're quite successful across stack . customer building nevs software-defined , happened play majority platform . partnership many major tier 1 . 're eight largest robotaxi also truck company . partnership mapping company simulation company . point across ecosystem , buying product large , looking ecosystem partner take advantage ev development . show guy product roadmap inside car . think key point want stress need av constantly increasing compute requirement l4-l5 even close solved . sensor resolution growing . complexity network people developing car growing sophistication . people building bev transformer self-driving car . customer trying build like single model , almost like say , large language model , 's like end-to-end av network car . situation like , need general-purpose programmable architecture n't know algorithm want use , want ﬂexible able change rapidly . product . performance growing significantly , ensure apis , cuda , cuda apis , tensorrt apis architecturally compatible , like high-end sku low-end sku [ ph ] across generation storage software compatible oriented software compatible xavier . customer take car , could essentially imagine someone take orin car , take orin computer , swap thor computer software run . performance headroom able create new software service life car . 's platform we're building automotive . think one trend want talk lived world every new service feature car solved new computer car past . getting point people 100 computer car , happens , 's super hard program , super hard sort improve experience , maintain ensure security car supercritical . see industry moving towards centralization multiple computer integrated unified one central computer . 's thor designed . 're taking lot innovation data center talk sort thing like multi-instance gpu , essentially mean thor actually like multiple compute cluster inside run one application one , keep separate another . data center technology innovation nvidia put car . reason fundamentally next- generation self-driving car truly data center wheel , call , get benefit innovation infrastructure able pull vehicle roadmap . value customer lower-power , lower-cost solution sort program eﬃciently life car . range electric vehicle better sort integrate vehicle one core architecture . value customer beyond programmability . 's also lower-cost lower power . one thing wanted talk , huge investment platform strategy guy kind see talk ecosystem platform huge investment software , care increasing installed base platform . 're excited partnership announced mtk , mediatek essentially gpus , cuda , tensorrt get integrated socs automotive . customer want use tab access cuda , tensorrt drive software , operating system , middleware , q - pierre ferragu - ali kanithe application software built , support platform software -- platform ecosystem advantage . beginning . chiplet essentially sort gave access mediatek available partner ecosystem , automotive . point platform valuable huge part investment software , huge part investment cuda tensorrt , sort increase scale installed base platform , better industry 're holding expanding footprint . jump away slide . slide give guy picture pipeline . 've announced pipeline $ 14 billion next six year . show pipeline ramp . sort take look slide , mean xpan neo [ ph ] ramped production . time , 'll start see new hyundai kia model ramp start see polestar line , start see sort nevs , spike , lucid , byd start ramp 'll see mercedes jaguar , land rover . , know , automotive win announced start ramp many year future , 's six-year pipeline give sense sort value win system take time ramp . kind show pipeline ramp ramp time . slide open q & . question answer thanks , ali . thanks slide , thanks bringing like broader perspective . like pilot , drive platform much chip car . useful . maybe 'd like focus first two question better understanding helping investor understanding . like drive product strategy translates term business model ? end-of-the-day sell mostly chip ? think like revenue split automotive division actually going -- make like money make selling chip like minority overall revenue opportunity ? yeah . let try summarize type product . someone buy chip , chip asp software asp always . even drive operating system , go production , need safe . revenue operating system safe license . go stack , customer might say , want build entire stack end-to-end , want l2 plus l3 software . q - pierre ferragu - ali kani q - pierre ferraguthose case , value software grow larger value hardware , depends customer want . one thing talked architecture designed modular take want . look slide partner ramp , note vast majority take chip operating system middleware , full stack . full stack partner like jaguar , land mercedes . point , u , 's open . 's whatever best partner layer software service based need . aggregate , end somewhere middle , someone wanted u software work , value software value hardware . thing , product , right , like someone want drive sim synthetic data generation , case , 's software , right ? 're giving access simulate software 're using stimulate av experience . thing someone wanted -- 's hybrid product like ovx constellation . people buy hardware , 's like replica orin thor would car , could x86 cpu discrete gpus customer architect robotaxis like . want drive sim software , would software revenue top . really depends . one thing many product . start hardware , actually , case , customer could buy hardware u pay software drive sim , could actually license software , use hardware . 've kind run gamut think one thing 's consistent across stack actually software . okay . helpful . ( multiple speaker ) u . yeah . 's helpful . mentioned know , 's important like ecosystem aspect . 're aiming platform like nvidia product , 're open broad ecosystem third party . question wondering , open also ecosystem term hardware ? kind answered question already partly , 'd like push bit . client choose like board hardware nvidia use nvidia elsewhere ? thinking question , likey let 's talk tesla , well known -- , large client nvidia run amongst larger gpu cluster worldwide . - ali kani q - pierre ferragu - ali kaniownership ( inaudible ) 'm pretty sure ca n't comment specifically nvidia , yes , tell u open altentative hardware , nvidia help oem choose like mobileye moto qualcomm , another solution board still want nvidia road ? [ ph ] yeah . 're open . 's great question way think explains strategy . partner actually , think sort partner , many case customer use computer car , 're really important customer u cloud . gave example tesla . help tesla training simulating av model using hardware cloud , n't use u car , that's perfectly fine . 's great thing great customer . architect stack 's -- 's totally fine . , course , someone used car someone used cloud , 's like advantage like train cuda , tensorrt cloud , apis , algorithm developed actually run inference car . always train gpus cloud change exact architecture , mobileye qualcomm car 's perfectly fine . many case 're open . 're supportive . way would say , want help partner regardless use u . many layer software , 's perfectly fine , right ? someone may say , want help simulation . yes . 'm using someone else . would say , 's great . let u talk help simulation . give synthetic data generation . help retail configurator . help training software -- software mobileye cloud . great opportunity u 're open . architect like . thing kind mentioned hinted -- course , 's case someone say , well , 'd love access capability car , n't want buy chip . way could sort license thing car put soc ? answer course yes 's announced mediatek , right , yeah , 's fine . want access capability put car , could competitor , could oem , would happy sort give access gpu let build solution car , , course , help cloud based . q - pierre ferragu - ali kani q - pierre ferragu - ali kani q - pierre ferragu - ali kani q - pierre ferragu yeah . okay , 's useful . 'm going ask like really tough question one . mentioned like $ 14 billion $ 16 billion pipeline , imagine , want ( inaudible ) 'm wondering , know , split -- sideline split like hardware software platform full stack operating system middleware . comment way ? yeah . think let answer slightly differently . feel like pipeline , kind saw way showed , saw full stack customer end forecast period , right ? majority see customer sort skew soc lower software revenue . , like said scale full stack , number larger soc . 'm kind answering like kind say average across six year . think 's customer base end wanting , 's mix pipeline 's true partner , software revenue larger hardware revenue . okay . move lot big one , last question like , like oem customer partner like training like simulation cluster , would data center client end day . typically customer recognizing division , customer like sitting data center division ? yeah . okay . way would answer , first , recorded data centre , cloud , infrastructure reported data center . actually internal business unit like run business , actually manage within automotive team constantly working together , right ? 're talking customer car talk cloud time . internally manage one business , keep simple investor community , choose take cloud put data center revenue . okay . logic applies pipeline . pipeline talk always pipeline -- 's revenue reported domestic division . yeah . [ ph ] okay , great . thanks clarification . let ask one question . look broader like passenger car opportunity really nvidia , tesla , mobileye . - ali kani q - pierre ferragu - ali kanitoday , tesla integrated . everything house . mobileye offering scale-integrated package . open bit time , offering apis , customization opportunity clearly need market . like like open player . question , think potentially creating dependency adoption technology , offer open environment , mean oems -- one reason choose want develop technology , -- make system integration . unfortunately know sometimes company struggle good job might end delaying technology set . 'm going give name 've heard news ﬂow like large car manufacturer throwing initiative actually failing deliver . see risk open strategy versus offering turnkey solution oem client ? first , let sort say , remember strategy . yes . customer want sort someone build full stack , case , course , deliver solution . might someone want slight half-and-half . want really building software also taking software u . case customer say , 'm going build full stack , want develop hardware . think , risk , 's risk oem want take 's aligned strategy . would say started mobileye like point case customer say , strategy . want force u take perception software . want build . , course , u , 's okay time . partner , n't work like way . 's case mobileye customer taking good chunk stack . would never . risk really oem want support . value approach customer challenge later come say , help u , let 's say , wanted everything , aligned hyperion architecture . actually come later say , oh , yeah , like could -- like 're problem parking , give parking stack we've developed platform opportunity u help risk come fruition . 's course even something q - pierre ferragu - ali kani q - pierre ferragu - ali kani q - pierre ferraguenvision beginning . case partner come u later say , hey , ended-up harder thought , help u . case , 're like , yeah , 're happy help sort add software offering provide . okay . see trend market ? would say like oems more- and-more like moving towards like integrated approach want nvidia ? would say oem strategy -- oem strategy long-term able competency house long-term like n't mean like next sop . mean 15 year future . think oems , feel like software run car something responsible . happens 's lot investment oems making right , electrification ﬂeet , software-defined car , cockpit software , av software . make investment time actually know-how hire world-class team function . try partner place help . think long-term , everyone want able , well , let 's say 's l4-l5 . think 've seen 's far harder anyone imago n't believe 're going see oem short term . think 're going partnering . future , 's production team ramped , could imagine 20-year horizon oem might ability able something , 's 's proven training thing . take long-time . okay , 's interesting . even see maybe trend coming back ask stack , long-term ambition still able develop internal competency , 's great . yeah . ambition absolutely right . think every oem want able . think 'm saying , 's lot harder people think happens , 's hard predict . 'm sort telling think 's like 20 year . good . 'm going try sneak like two last question training [ ph ] might bit challenging . first one , work nvidia show cost base nvda , especially cost-of-goods-sold like bill material basis , competitive . hardware car vision chip competitive . - ali kani q - pierre ferragu - ali kanimobileye morning , really talked cost competitiveness ben stronger like underlying driver strong market share today what's deployed also underline confidence strong market position going forward . -- like -- would say total system cost $ 3,000 $ 4,000 , slice actual electronics semiconductor part cost $ 1,000 $ 2,000 . tell u like cost positioning nvidia ? 's course diﬃcult question open ecosystem . 's like really card , [ ph ] think competitiveness cost like-for-like kind future basis ? yeah . would sort say two thing . one focus l2+ l2+ higher . believe every entry car l2+ time like we're going see shift software service opportunity ﬂeet . 're building l2+ car , position cost perspective competitive , kind see right , really building l2+ car industry . tesla outside tesla , like bunch chinese oems . 's volvo , mercedes , jaguar land rover . guy really building l2+ software-defined vehicle . see , share successful market . price performance positioning nvidia quite good segment . far sensor stack go , strategy unique like 've shown hyperion architecture architecture scalable . 's l3 configuration . people say want build single orin computer camera radar , . cost sensor super-low cost , cost computer low , people building system l2+ market really attractive price . think positioning good 's scalable . make sense ? scalable . 's good l2+ . 's good l3 . 's good l4 , scale . certainly n't need lidar . need camera couple radar architecture sport . thing , customer platform choose sensor set n't deliver software . customer say hey , want even lower-cost sensor set 're able . 's architecture quite successful . never force sensor set . actually come sensor set use wish . okay , 's clear . last question would , 've talked mostly like passenger car opportunity robotaxi like driverless experience . one question based -- project team entire different level . 's view past side option ? see first like significant rollouts vehicle timeline well ? q - pierre ferragu - ali kani q - pierre ferraguokay . first , 'll say . think 'll find couple city well sort green light trial need see successful . 're already seeing city could night robotaxi allowed operate turn proving 're safer driver real world , think 'll see rollout commercial good delivery one car transporting good one place think 'll see adoption start . think whole industry need super cautious , need super responsible , n't rush anything know even one accident kind become big deal industry . believe take time . 'll get early success , need take time make sure 're right . n't expect like passenger car decade . 's much harder problem . 's unrestricted . undefined . could anywhere . think , take longer . 's technology better human . 's -- need even much better human know human make accident , 're sympathetic , ai make accident , think 're little bit le sympathetic . think 'll trial starting . , 're next year two certain city . think sort l4 true consumer car next decade could even take longer . depends could get . really can't make mistake . 's super , super charging . way -- need validation simulation ca n't ( multiple speaker ) help partner . think come even better way stimulate scenario could possibly happen make sure 's safe . ali , would like spend like two hour stretching year fantastic opportunity industry , unfortunately , 're already time . thank much making time participating comparison bringing perspective perspective nvidia . hope 'll stay touch . thank . thanks .
