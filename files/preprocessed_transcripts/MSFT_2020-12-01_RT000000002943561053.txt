's specific customer , tenant . 's even specific graph level individual user . instance , individual user level , hand back thing , like , designer cloud manifest powerpoint . 've couple year . billion slide kept suggest slide design people . fact , quarter slide kept , 's pretty high keep rate , 25 % slide 're presenting day kept . 've got great set new service 've integrating excel example . allows u reason data model , even allows u use natural language query create pivot chart . pivot table , imagine , back day learning stuff , could say , oh , talk 's kid know , , really powerful service . service go . editor word , us neural net-powered assistance , based signal . within team , automatic transcription translation , speaker identification , search , based signal processing signal . move organization , even kind expand way use . something called project cortex , creates knowledge graph organization . end becoming important database , think , optimizing productivity help organization know know help people tap knowledge . 're even using signal security microsoft intelligent security . read eight trillion signal referenced day across product helping remediation proactive identification security threat well . 's kind think innovation see wonderful opportunity create platform talked minute ago , make sure 're using platform capture , aggregate , process create real value signal . 's 're see lot innovation coming . helpful , really help better appreciate underlying foundation innovation 's driving much , , knowledge worker , sitting front computer look forward taking advantage hopefully - jared spataro q - brad alan zelnick - jared spatarobeing able get pivot table . 'm usually relying people team day . case , -- jared , dive little bit deeper team . would love . got several question . , maybe starter , 've rolled hundred new feature team last year . excited hearing customer ? yes , 'll start first first feature conceived , produced rolled pandemic , call together mode . -- tell story together mode , like talk reaction people first first saw graphical user interface xerox parc year year ago . rudimentary . looked little cartoony . people n't sure going work . vision , realize saw gooey , seeing future . feel way together mode . ground everyone , together mode really based customer demand . seeing first real fatigue using video conferencing product literally making people tired n't know . went work started realize put tax brain n't person n't quite know . second thing found people hard time connecting kind brady bunch square view . based , pulled expert , looked learned virtual reality realize could use ai kind cut people background place shared background . sort different shared background . meeting room , auditorium , even coffee shop . lined next . science , 've gone back done , science actually tell u brain taxed le . 've removed extraneous background information , much easier brain process , create connection people well . think 're kind seeing future digital transformation , kind digital innovation starting focused people connecting opposed getting sort like mechanical task done . together mode far one favorite . actually use tech way power nba , national basketball association . 60,000 fan attended 170 nba game together , including shaq president obama , proud could see tech used way connect people . q - brad alan zelnick - jared spatarobut , would say addition type thing , 've seen whiteboard example , integration whiteboard team people could creative work really differentiator u , becoming increasingly important people really get back creative 're able physical space . breakout room something part industry . used today brad i. n't team . something needed catch . quickly caught . thing true call 7x7 gallery view , ability stack lot people space , 're even innovating beyond think ﬂow work . perspective , video conferencing one workload experience team offer . thing like meeting prep , meeting recap , transcription meeting . tell team best meeting meeting n't attend read later 's love .
