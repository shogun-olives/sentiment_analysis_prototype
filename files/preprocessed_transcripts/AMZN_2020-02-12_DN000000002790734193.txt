great . thank . go ahead get started . name heath terry , lead tmt research goldman sachs . goldman sachs employee , 's special point pride last three year first roy joseph david solomon took center stage aws : invent opening keynote front 50,000 people . audience every : invent conference , 's particular point pride introduce andy jassy , chief executive oﬃcer amazon web service . andy joined amazon 1997 , straight business school . 2003 , led team founding aws , creating world 's undisputed leader cloud computing . company inside amazon worth , according math , well $ 0.5 trillion . andy joined conversation goldman sachs ' ceo , david solomon . andy , david , welcome . good afternoon , everyone . andy , thank . 've got lot easier start . : invent , made actually work put stage . dj keynote , quite good , way . people still talking set . well , mean , 07:45 morning , easy dj 10,000 people . david m. solomon andrew r. jassyyou good energy . 07:45 ( multiple speaker ) try best . let 's dive right . 've amazon 22 year . founded aws little 50 people 2003. 're going generate $ 45 billion revenue business year half company 's profit . put financials aside , start think scale 've built , kind quantify u little bit scale aws fast continues grow ? well , 's kind amazing adventure business $ 40 billion revenue run rate , growing 34 % year-over-year million active customer , define non-amazon entity use platform last 30 day , 's really broad diverse group . 's -- early day aws , mostly start-ups building business scratch top aws company like slack instagram pinterest stripe robinhood company like . 's happened last half dozen year enterprise public sector rapidly adopted aws cloud see every imaginable vertical business segment using cloud , 're financial service , work goldman capital one intuit commonwealth bank australia healthcare johnson & johnson merck pfizer bristol- myers squibb manufacturing ge shire electric , philip . seems every imaginable vertical business segment using cloud meaningful way . public sector , 6,500 government agency worldwide , 11,000 academic institution 29,000 non-profits . , broad fast growing customer base . -- looking revenue trillion request get various service time , -- 's little hard able track everybody 's relative market segment share 're one really publish full metric . pretty significant market segment leadership share . really kind see breadth look everyday life , look ride sharing use lyft uber , ola india grab southeast asia mytaxi europe , running aws cloud . use medium service , netﬂix run completely aws . obviously amazon prime disney+ , watch super bowl watch streaming fox live top aws . use peloton use -- son big orderer food , postmates grubhub doordash . 's pervasive impact every day life yet always say , really strongly believe 's still early day people moving cloud . even though business growing fast reasonable size , think 's going different 10 year . david m. solomon andrew r. jassy yeah . -- one thing 's fascinating see big business significant innovation large organization . mean , time , amazon much bigger , large organization , big innovation . advice , think actually , advice would give -- goldman sachs trying innovate business , advice would give larger company around innovating , building new business line inside strong organization ? yeah . well , thing -- thing helpful u think -- n't necessarily mean 'd helpful everybody , think they're generally useful principle . first hire people want build . disproportionately index hiring builder think builder people like invent , people look different customer experience honest 's working try reinvent customer experience . people really understand launch starting line finish line . many great people technology love get launch lose interest . really rarely catch lightning bottle , keep listening customer iterating . got hire right type builder . think got organize team allow move quickly . think one important thing aws early day natural place build aws would infrastructure team leveraged data center network . instead , pulled completely group people run consumer business scale every day new business always lose existing surer bet . making sure organize separable autonomous team , destiny n't burdened run core business 're running every day . got give team right building block able move really quickly . think one interesting thing amazon last 10 year unbelievably quickly consumer business moved would tell big piece able use aws building block external customer use . need culture encourages innovation . sound fairly obvious like everybody want encourage new thing . think lot big company , especially get bigger , senior people walking meeting hearing new idea looking way say . ill willed , get conservative , seems harder imagine successful something new , 's hard think one team effort manage . would say opposite really true amazon . senior leader tell favorite meeting one listen new idea , n't say yes everything , say yes lot . spend energy meeting trying problem solve team david m. solomon andrew r. jassy david m. solomonto get yes . think last thing , 're going invent , especially significant existing business 's success , willing tolerate failure . hire great people achievement-oriented people , sometimes weird dichotomy . think amazon , lot type people hate fail . yet , 're pushing envelope , 're going get right time . always found launch phone culturally reaﬃrming . may known , launched phone n't exactly work . yet like input , output n't work . input team hired , plan built , customer conversation , technology built , timing . liked input , even though work , took learning technology could reuse reapplied gave people good landing spot . n't , great people fear working new thing 'll worry wo n't spot n't work . 's really good point . talked -- said early . 's lot adoption go . first inning , second inning , mean , early ? would say maybe , two out , bottom first , runner board . run side though . think 's -- look total global spend , 3 % cloud . 's moving fast 's growing fast . think 's -- strong opinion , 've really seen play faster imagined fullness time n't know 's 10 year 15 year 20 year . company data center . much smaller footprint , workload n't worth moving 're going leave mainframe die something close something like factory latency wise . moving cloud . 's early day . think people make move . make move , choose time modernize lot older software . look , lot lot customer moving away mainframe lot customer moving away older guard commercial grade database thing like aurora lot folk moving quickly modernizing window linux . see type move , also see huge explosion saas provider building product really organically right get-go top cloud . 's different world , still early day . talked thing obviously changing move bottom first two men move towards ninth . else change ? -- look get closer ninth inning , besides change mentioned , else see ? andrew r. jassy david m. solomon andrew r. jassy yeah . think whatever 's worth , 'm sure 'll get ninth inning lifetime working . think -- period unbelievably fast growth . think 's changed 14 year since aws launched pace change really rapid . think next 14 year going even rapid . think look like think 'll company wo n't data center . think 'll see compute 's done server-less model . think generation developer choose programming model , n't think cluster server . think 'll see different play regard people use database , relational side people moving away lot expensive proprietary punitive old guard provider , also increasingly company n't use one relational database satisfy database need , use purpose-built database , 's see people using thing like key value store cash database craft database time series database . database different , almost every application machine learning ai infused . 'll billion , maybe trillion device live everywhere oﬃces , home , factory car plane ship oil field agricultural field device going collecting data sending cloud analytics sending smarter action back device , productive . lot task human today kind mundane task done robotics application , human focus higher level value-added activity . mean , kind way , different 're also optimistic future quantum computing play role well . let 's shift 'll talk artificial intelligence little bit . know 's huge area innovation 're spending lot time . think 10,000 people working alexa alone . talk little bit kind vision direction ai play going forward , context something like alexa context 've talking , broadly , let 's talk little bit impact ai ? yeah . think 've working ai machine learning 20 year amazon . kind see everywhere business , recommendation see retail side fueled machine learning . look pick path , people fulfillment center use go get product box used machine learning algorithm . look prime air , drone effort , look amazon go , computer vision algorithm drive , look alexa obviously . 've long time deeply embedded business capability yet still ton idea . david m. solomonnow , today , n't many machine learning ai expert practitioner lot exist live kind big technology company . 're trying -- think collectively getting educated , 's part aws lot service capability 're building enable company take advantage promise . -- see kind three macro layer stack . bottom layer expert machine learning practitioner , n't many world , people comfortable building model picking algorithm training model tuning model deploying keep running model become stale . provide lot way use popular framework build chip make faster , training inference prediction , thing like . n't many expert machine learning practitioner , important thing feel like done make much accessible every enterprise build middle layer stack , built service called sagemaker , enables every day developer data scientist much easily build , train , tune deploy machine learning algorithm fraction time . mean , look intuit train fraud model le week used take six month . big difference . top layer stack people n't want build model . actually want plug model we've built get answer back application programming interface call api call . thing like text , turn speech , audio transcribe text . take text translate lot language , take transcribed translated text tell 's , n't read . let natural language processing , help internal search . internet try search internet , 's pretty lousy company . use natural language understanding natural language processing change ? help u -- 'll give u personalization algorithm , give u forecasting algorithm , service top layer company really hungry plug model company scale data . think company operate three layer stack . would argue middle layer maybe single important enterprise much data want use predictive algorithm get value . transition 're talking requires significant investment . one thing , see , 's obvious got build something new . go build apple card , build cloud . 're looking legacy 're thinking upgrading moving forward , massive investment that's necessary . talk investment board , big company , founder business people running big business ? talk andrew r. jassyinvestment way motivates people make investment quicker move along faster ? 's really good question 's really relevant right stage adoption 're enterprise public sector , feel like 're early stage , meat enterprise public sector adoption . think almost always conversation starter discussion cost . company , turn capital expense lay server data center variable expense pay consume , 's attractive . get turn variable expense something lower large scale pas form lower price . 've lowered price 75 different occasion last eight year . largely competitive -- absence competitive pressure dna inside amazon relentlessly work take cost give back customer form lower price . turn capex variable expense , 's lower variable expense could get real elasticity instead decide much infrastructure provision either provision little outage exceed , nobody . everyone provision peak , 's reason call peak sit wasted capital cloud . provision need . turn need , pay -- scale seamlessly . n't need anymore , give back stop paying . cost different cloud existed 's compelling virtually every company . number one reason enterprise public sector organization moving cloud agility speed ability innovate much rapid clip . unless operate business segment competition , people , move quickly people inventing rapid rate , start-ups , also competitor adopting cloud . two compelling reason board leadership team want move . think -- think really get dime get going . lot challenge turn n't technical . spend lot time talking technical piece , pretty trackable . lot challenge frankly leadership . first thing really happen senior leadership team decide really want move , conviction inertia really powerful thing inside organization . often people middle organization n't excited moving others may n't know mean job scope proud built . senior leadership team truly convicted moving set aggressive top goal force organization move faster otherwise would . favorite example maybe ge making decision really wanted move cloud cio time jamie miller decided going move 30 -- 50 application aws 30 day . got david m. solomon andrew r. jassytechnology leader together said 're . said 45 minute , told dopey would n't work n't make sense . said , listened said heard , going . let 's go . go 42 application 30 day . process , learnt compliance model , governance model , security model success idea started rolling , could set second really aggressive goal top , move 7,000 application aws year . senior level conviction aggressive top goal force org move mean business , 's really easy dip toe water several year wake realize competitor 're far away . good point . talk competitive landscape , talk competitive landscape cloud computing . yeah . think every major technology company either trying build kind replica aws built cloud computing infrastructure space . 've working aws since start . 've market 14 year working guess 16.5 year . many big surprise , lot big surprise , probably single biggest one long took large technology company build something -- looked like aws trying . -- trying get launch without anybody knowing time , amazon really thought retailer . felt like n't get market first , 'll harder u successful seattle pretty small city . know lot people side lake trying get launch without anybody knowing . never imagined we'd six seven year head start . significant market segment leadership share point . think reason . think first thing lot functionality part started earlier part we're innovating faster clip , really turn matter 're trying migrate existing application premise cloud want unleash builder build anything imagine . right tool right job save time money . much larger ecosystem partner , 's thousand system integrator helping enterprise move cloud , 's isps saas provider adapt software work technology infrastructure platform , two , three . start aws leadership position . get move cloud lot software used using want use . david m. solomon andrew r. jassy david m. solomon andrew r. jassyand think maturity platform pretty different spot . expression use internally compression algorithm experience 's ca n't learn certain lesson get different elbow curve scale . business 's couple time larger next provider combined , learn lesson scale much earlier stage , way ca n't always convince builder worry . early day business , used argument whether releasing something -- whether going one billion chance would error , whether okay . look scale , 're hundred trillion dice roll point . 's shortcut getting , get scale , change think architecture infrastructure . yeah . amazon broadly initiative across range industry , range business . time , see business , create channel conﬂict 're trying way competitor push push around working . deal issue ? would -- work better ecosystem inside amazon ? would work better ecosystem outside amazon ? aws ? yeah . well , surprisingly , number conversation topic . always share get chance speak customer really two existing significant industry amazon disrupted . one retail technology infrastructure . case , model pretty antiquated customer n't happy model somebody going end reinventing . case , turned u . would also say look company space , 's actually really great lesson u people come try new thing area . company listen customer cared watched reacting adjusted done quite well new era . one n't , poopooed wished away dissed , spend resource struggling . think great business great customer experience , simply somebody else enters space n't mean 're going kind business decline 're listening customer right adjusting inspired whatever new . think also david m. solomon andrew r. jassysometimes people , 's folklore mythology around , amazon launch business certain area mean business area going successful . n't seen . think thing 're working healthcare space think lot healthcare company lot success . mentioned launched something phone space n't seem much impact leader phone space . thing payment space paypal seems quite well . , 's segment large , 're winner-take-all , room several company successful . , 're good job customer keep evolving , 'll fine . think look 's -- 's hard u build business sustain long period time . mean , look company lasted . mean , guy exception . looking company lasted 50 year , let alone 100 year successful , 's hard . , number one thing far give chance successful long term good feedback loop customer , know care technology platform allows builder keep evolving business customer experience quickly need . n't platform allows easily long shot aws . that's usually talk talk thing , people usually find reason . yeah . 've got incredibly diverse set customer platform , start-ups , fortune 500 company , thousand company , also government agency . relationship technology company government getting increasingly complicated , lot scrutiny . -- 's broad question , think government 's role regulating technology technology continues expand infiltrate business broadly ? yeah . 's good question . think keep remembering technology continue completely change life customer experience communicate one another really almost everything . vast majority great people , way use technology irresponsible impact people 's civil liberty law . people use technology irresponsible unlawful way , held accountable . yet , would say n't ban technology could used irresponsibly . mean , think -- look evil thing done computer server year , look sony hack year ago . imagine world would like n't allow people use computer server , would radically different world . , think ban technology could used irresponsibly . think hold party use technology irresponsibly accountable . provider , david m. solomon andrew r. jassy david m. solomon andrew r. jassyourselves included , term service suspend people 's right use technology 're using unlawfully way impact people 's civil liberty , number people wanted go want clarity want delineation regimentation , want government actually regulate case technology used . 're supportive eager work government agency want . think 's important government , really thoughtful targeted 're trying protect over-regulate , ca n't get value technology 's lot people . 's complicated . mean , 's hard argue would n't benefit certain area better clear framework . history regulation , generally responding something , say , go far squelch opportunity . agree . 've got swing back way , shape form . information security , got big focus aws , big focus everywhere . think information security aws building culture around ? well , way build culture around anything pick thing important culture lot mechanism reinforce . u , security unquestionably number one priority drop everything 're feel like something need buttress . think everybody organization senior leader -- entry-level people organization understand number weekly biweekly monthly mechanism , 're involved working thinking figuring area customer want u . 's -- u , 's unquestionably number one priority . number mechanism build back . -- number thing customer want u , expect u ask u prioritize . early day aws , lot certification people wanted , want u iso compliant pci compliant hipaa compliant fedramp complaint . lot certification pursued . kind monitoring protection infrastructure , fine-grained identity access management people able secure want use , time , location , way multi-factor authentication , web application firewall way know kind david m. solomon andrew r. jassyanomalous data movement unusual access account . mean , kind service continue build . would say early day aws , first maybe six , seven year business , biggest blocker u enterprise security , problem security aws , people data matter , 's also number one priority . nervous . would often say , well , tell 're worried regard security cloud . 'd say , well , 'm worried 'm going lose control data . would say , well , know aws decide data go , n't move unless want move , look like blob u . 're extra-worried , encrypt motion rest . 'd say , okay . 'd say , well , ca n't go touch iron . 'd say , well , often go touch iron on-premises data center . go data center , 's like know 're touching lot time . think took time see customer use use securely understand feature capability . would say last five six year , security one single important seller people using cloud . think people come away looking deeply security , believing 'll secure posture aws would on- premise . company , 've made big commitment climate change . data center , obviously , meaningful consumer energy water . balance challenge cost growth thinking sustainable future . well , think -- mean , climate always obviously important , think increasingly last year crisis deepens . think 's big reason made climate pledge several week ago -- month ago . company size , diversity business , 's easy , mean , -- said 'd 80 % renewable energy 2024 , 100 % renewable energy 2030 net zero carbon 2040 , 10 year ahead paris agreement . look -- scale amazon diversity business , 's lot harder company 'll think . 's going require -- sure expensive . think way think much expensive rest world n't get behind fix 'll different world kid grandkids n't . requires lot invention , much 're going invention , lot 'll also third-party partner . one reason decided public climate pledge early really wanted incent hopefully inspire company invent space 're going need partner , u going need david m. solomon andrew r. jassypartners make happen . , 's important priority . data center space , cloud computing space , think sometimes people forget cloud computing significantly inherently energy eﬃcient on-premises data center , large part utilization much higher . like look 451 research study found running aws 3.6 time energy eﬃcient running average on-premises data center . look carbon intensity side , electricity consumed , renewables purchased run task aws 88 % carbon eﬃcient would on-premises . cloud much environmentally friendly construct data center company utilized 10 % 20 % , still lot we're continue energy eﬃcient . got kind invention 're around use water thoughtfully scarce way . 70 renewable project 've funded inside amazon 1,900 megawatt power 're generating . lot 're lot 're 's area investing innovation resource . 's great , 's great . finish . one challenge business , scale 're operating , spade attracting people , retaining people help make possible . thinking people management , talent scale 're operating ? 's really good question . , course , devil 's detail thing . -- 've amazon almost 23 year point . i've obviously drank kool-aid , 's kind remarkable many people we've company long . mean long u , 've around 25-ish year . mean look aws , person run product development almost 22 year , person run infrastructure almost 22 year , person run demand generation 14 year . 've kind almost naturally strong retention people . think big piece lot focus think keep people hungry motivated excited working amazon long period time intentional culture going prioritize want . u , mentioned earlier , disproportionately index hiring builder . 's want company . -- n't think builder technologist . , people unbelievable operator inventive operation change way think able get something done cost structure time frame take get thing done . want builder everything . , try culture everything talk senior leadership team build type company type culture allow builder build . thing -- talk process david m. solomon andrew r. jassy david m. solomondo n't like , bureaucracy might see creeping , lot want knock want make world 's best place builder build . think really place like amazon 're builder that's spend time trying figure . yeah . appreciate . andy , 's really great come spend time group today . appreciate thought . thanks u . appreciate . thank . absolutely . thanks lot .
