good morning welcome bloomberg intelligence webinar dissecting apple post-covid era . today wednesday , may 26 , 2020. name anand srinivasan , primary apple analyst , semiconductor hardware analyst bloomberg intelligence . four colleague bringing expertise bear subject . geetha ranganathan medium analyst ; julie chariell fintech analyst ; amine bensaid also cover medium , specifically opining music woo jin ho [ ph ] expert semiconductor networking , talking 3d frequency front-ends . packed call . n't get started . administrative item begin . today 's presentation recorded , available playback . access replay via link sent email bloomberg webinars email come bloomberg webinars . bottom slide window , adjust volume maximize screen also ask question . would strongly urge participant use method . ask question submitting one right slide , area 's called question answer . address question conclusion presentation copy slide used today distributed post event email . mentioned , packed agenda 've stored -- divided discussion point call area . one want talk short versus longer term . want talk two subject area depth . two vector think drive investment thesis apple . one iphone install base . within talk iphone-12 launch , effect 5g . think pricing going change 2021. 'll talk . second golden egg case would service business . within scope service business , talk subdivision service laid spread . estimated business , talk outside opportunity . medium , streaming side well music side , talk fintech think principally [ ph ] . also discus extensive apple 's chip ambition . last certainly least address valuation leave time conference q & . , let 's get started . talking near-term versus long term , obviously near term calendar year 2020 -- fiscal 2021 case apple impacted , covid impacted . surprisingly near term le shallow weakness 's -- first foreseen . long term , think substantial opportunity expand install base , also drive mix shift asp perspective raise number one number two , also drive service . one thing want convey assumed apple coverage recently fact apple benefit burden scale term market share , see 's substantial owner market share 191 million unit , certainly biggest asp perspective , 's skewed pretty far right , certainly scale smartphone volume perspective . second part look consumption semiconductor . example , apple substantial consumer dram , nand well logic chip . merchant silicon third party qualcomms , internally designed made tsmc . 'll talk effect scale . think singular vector growth longer term china india expansion , obviously asp perspective android penetration versus io penetration , particularly prc china , 's multiple term asp , 's multiple term android phone sold versus io phone . , believe two country represent long-term growth opportunity iphone relative android . wanted spend little bit time virtuous cycle install base , new iphone sold , new adding install base , slowly expanding , dramatically new content via app store , turn drive content-enabled device adjacent product proliferates wider content new platform apple cycle continues . look iphone , paranoid obsessive install base , install base n't change drastically near term , think 1.3 billion [ ph ] unit consider iphone , ipad max , et cetera , across platform . think 1.3 billion installed base . look 1q '18 4q '19 installed base rapidly grown . substantial vector growth term installed base potential . one discounted financing angle . also trade-in program . help potentially drive higher asp product dramatically ( technical diﬃculty ) grow would financing n't trade-in program . estimated sort small bleed iphone installed base shockingly last quarter 's trend , surprised impact covid much shallower anticipated . result , dramatically changed march june number prior print . printed roughly 37 million unit . estimate idc . think go sort 28 million unit june quarter , rebound calendar third fourth quarter 43 72 million unit iphone pretty substantial . -- obviously product re-freshes , everybody ob . look 8 plus , se , 11 pro max , across board compare relative previous rendition iphone , well comparable product samsung , huawei , -- mean technological basis , necessarily -- every feature set n't leader , leader camera resolution processor density , et cetera , closed ecosystem , coupled strong tie-in device service dramatically expands ecosystem revenue potential relative android . result , continuingly focused installed base expansion rather given quarter 's shipment . 'll talk asp nauseam towards -- go presentation . 5g particular enhancer , obviously value 5g customer perspective brings higher speed lower latency app experience , also drive newer apps richer video , 4k content , enhanced music , et cetera . turn lead wider app development , benefit carrier perspective also customize delivery application -- tailor content tailor delivery mechanism based user history , location , interest , et cetera . effectively giving carrier sharper monetization mechanism device 5g network . turn brings wider interest apps service , wider customer perspective 's higher speed lower latency , richer video , et cetera , customer perspective . wider carrier perspective slice dice user pool better , tailor content monetize much sharp fashion would able 4g 3g . turn drive cycle wide 5g adoption could wider . taking effect covid 're talking little bit long term . near term , want step back one second look near term . look . 've done 2020 model actually done month month analysis , effectively track disease potentially overlaid spending inclination result , across region region region . 's came unit number highlighted earlier . second part 5g phone going expensive 2021. think samsung little bit failed experiment trying raise price n't go well , discontinue later . think apple may learned n't think ﬂagship price going increase 2020. introduction iphone se rebranding re-launch iphone se , actually brings new lower asp product mix -- look bar bell curve price distribution io 2007 current , yes , two peak . one 750 800 range one thousand plus range . think -- regardless iphone se increase first bump , think potential -- raise price 2021 ability push second peak barbell pretty aggressively . interesting thing chart 're looking front look white blue column apple , samsung huawei , unit value perspective , see white blue substantially bigger piece apple even versus samsung huawei go show apple substantially richer q mix relative samsung huawei . apple trying market share leader unit perspective selling expensive phone , ability drag much wider service business . , installed base going steady , growing much slowly potentially , lower end product could asp perspective , service mix drag going richer remember service margin almost x [ ph ] product margin . barbell curve talking earlier , double bump see , one 750 800 range , one thousand plus range . go show regardless iphone asp starting price , bulk unit sold actually carry value substantially higher , right . think even though iphone se going drag left asp perspective , think 2021 actually going enhance sku mix right hand side graph . think opportunity apple raise price effectively potentially optically , might introduce one two skus -- higher end spectrum thereby weighted average price platform go . want spend little bit time service , obviously , , want refocus two vector growth . one iphone installed base , laid case 2021 could see improved unit well wider asp couple 5g , drive service . service golden egg . diverse , fast growing , margin enhancing , obviously would n't know . quick question , optic slide apparently blurry angela , anything done improve eligibility , diﬃcult follow data . anything ? isp sort thing client 's side . okay . question . 'll -- client asked question happy send graph email , following conversation . service . specked detail . think least 11 sub-segments service , see roughly $ 48 billion business trailing 12-month revenue perspective . think diverse mentioned , certain element might popularly known versus certain others , run quick detail , 'll also talk potential area growth across . first applecare . applecare think modelled around roughly 26 % service business . 's substantial piece pie . number one . number 2 , 's sticky piece pie 's substantially different maintenance program seen . -- strong attach , 's got geetha ranganathanmonthly fee somewhere $ 6 $ 15 would conservatively assume $ 12 $ 13 price point fact brings roughly fifth attach rate new phone , 's pretty staggering think business steady-eddie business think phone get expensive attach rate potential higher . second app store business popularly known piece business . interesting piece division free apps paid apps potentially app monetization . obviously game downloads pay -- app . apple take 30 % cut continuing revenue apple take 15 % . substantial monetization potential , bulk apps third-party apps . apple native apps . , 'll talk 's important , even buy netﬂix subscription third party subscription apple , pay apple 30 % first year , 15 % second year bulk apple -- bulk apps third-party apps . remarkable potential potentially native apps , native content obviously -- wider revenue structure much richer margin mix . interesting business . fact 's getting paid google default search engine io product incredibly high margin piece business . 've modeled roughly $ 8.8 billion 2019. inclining litigation two finally settled default search engine , 's staggering number , number one . number two , 's near 100 % margin . number three , 's sticky . think piece pie . actually modeled modeling every business conservatively . leftover revenue relative reported revenue licensing fee . 've rather conservative think relative broker estimate we've seen - mentioned popular press . think number conservative relative . want switch gear talk apple 's medium aspiration . talk different piece pie service business exist , want switch gear geetha ranganathan , medium analyst call see could medium franchise wanted . geetha , want give u quick screening [ ph ] medium business , , apple could interested ? yes . absolutely . thanks anand , hello everyone . streaming become extremely crowded space major medium company launching called direct consumer platform past month . fact hbo max , went live today . apple tv plus actually launched back november 2019 fairly ambitious goal . wanted create apple 's hbo . 's happened little six month later , apple tv plus really part streaming conversation . kind want give sense term subscriber . sign indicate apple service somewhat slow start , report suggest 10 million subscriber , actually seems like decent number . caveat nobody really paying service . even though compelling 499 price point , one cheapest service , remember , almost 100 % subscriber free six month , apple probably tough time free trial start run . want catch service like netﬂix disney subscriber standpoint , 's going real tough slog . ? , course , bit late game crowded market . , need differentiated product . kind look apple disney , launched service time november last year . kind really come content . , apple tv launched , nine original show , far service anywhere 23 25 original , 's really slim offering compared heavy weight , especially look netﬂix , kind become force original space close almost 1200 title . kind look apple tv plus service n't enough keep people coming back day day offering available . mean , show win acclaim , really kind provoking water cooler type conversation . 's really stumbling block ? look hbo . look netﬂix , n't start original powerhouse . hbo made entrance playing old movie classic sitcom syndicated . netﬂix built initial subscriber base offering exhaustive amount licensed tv show movie people wanted watch . disney plus , instance , owes success kid focused back catalog . bottom line apple need content , need library . question next ? obviously money object company like apple . obviously afford put lot money -- course , paying show , kind put slide show per episode cost show kind take look apple tv really held back come spending bigger show , morning show instance $ 15 million per episode . see , another science fiction show similar amount . look -- look per season cost . pretty , pretty high industry perspective , almost 150 million . think apple probably hoping much better reception , kind heavily investing star powered show , really n't made much headway . question , next ? , kind wanted give sense big medium operator spending annually content . apple really want taken seriously medium space , 's -- 're looking anywhere $ 20 billion $ 25 billion bigger anand srinivasan geetha ranganathancompanies 2023. rather spending show n't necessarily proven track record uncertain roi , guess big question invest library kind eternal question investor , invest library , buy catalog , know 're getting , 've always hesitated . come build versus buy , 've always kind gone build far medium concerned . finally , kind wanted show studio marketplace , could potential acquisition target . kind looked sony , lionsgate , mgm . rumored past potential acquisition target apple , either take individually kind cobble together 's still pretty manageable price tag , maybe $ 35 billion , $ 40 billion . question apple going studio ? geetha , get investor question two subject . one disney , right ? -- 's talked , 's realm possibility , 've actually addressed apple prime . one want talk perhaps maybe hair given acquisition theme park , et cetera . second part apple still clipping coupon content potentially buy third party , via io platform.you know risk distribution mechanism rather content owning -- owner le distributor . yes , sure . first , going back disney question . upside acquiring disney would obviously securing content streaming strategy , obviously potential synergy adding disney ip io platform . problem right especially covid-19 . mean , even pre-covid-19 , lot disney 's business especially tv network business really kind secular decline 'm especially referencing espn whole cord cutting phenomenon . covid-19 pandemic , 're finding almost disney's legacy business go theme park , go tv network , even studio , 's kind really getting battered pandemic . 'm really sure whether apple would kind want deal many business secular decline . 's far disney part concerned , mean streaming , really nothing working right . term owning content , think , ultimately able library , 's happening really want medium player , really need able show , need able huge licensed library happened tv plus service , n't really taken . term anand srinivasan geetha ranganathan anand srinivasan amine bensaidmedia powerhouse . n't think 's really going happen , unless able get access whole lot licensed content . ultimately kind , yes , effective distributor . , kind depends really wanted , 's game want keep playing . think , obviously successful far . continue successful . got . want expand service business clip faster team seeing right , requires major stake battlefield , one way acquiring content . exactly . got . thank , geetha . switching gear little bit successful piece business , apple music . interesting part apple 's music library larger user best advised spotify . hardware splash , big content really want understand dynamic business see could go , amine bensaid . amine , 's take music streaming business , potentially apple potentially strong potentially weak relative spotify ? thanks , anand welcome , everyone . think trend see today audio like mentioned , also geetha mentioned , think similar streaming video experienced , two , three year ago . mean one hand music streaming . think , growing around 30 % past two year , margin remained relatively low around 20 % 25 % . think entered phase narrative started shift traditional digital , like slide see worth pointing right side . ( inaudible ) everything traditional meaning like broadcast satellite radio exactly like ham [ ph ] . viewer audience starting shift top streaming audio . demand surged , especially covid-19 expected accelerate due pandemic experiencing . mean narrative going change , 's going focused music , 's going focused audio , general . mean -- meaning content probably going get focused next year . -- reason shift next slide . look traditional audio versus digital , see decline traditional audio anand srinivasan amine bensaidalready expected happen year . chart left , basically radio versus digital audio 's interesting done pre-covid-19 . expect actually work 's key speaking maybe iphone demographic . younger audience leaving traditional ecosystem much faster slightly older audience . rest [ ph ] content think 's going focus next year , mentioned . 's saw spotify upwards 100 million dollar content podcast . last week , saw couple report discussing apple amazon also thinking investing podcast . going back question . win new era . -- key leader . think mentioned spotify largest platform today . think , upper hand invest podcast way earlier recently week ago , ( inaudible ) got right joe hogan , arguably one top podcasts , think seeing , apple , amazon investing content help audio overall , specifically digital audio . traditional player one risk today meaning like two section world , think probably going keep losing share next year . got . , come back content story , similar video franchise , continue invest content potentially acquire big content podcast space , subscriber growth well , amine ? think , 's stage one . way see podcast first step reach attractive margin content , owning content think music , music -- 's kind dominated four major player . one -- said today , announced improvement ipo . one , know , universal , sony merlin . four -- basically label almost complete dominance music aspect , 's margin diﬃculty [ ph ] . answer question , yes , think , podcast first stage , spotify apple become big enough . suspect going focus everything audio related . n't know music starting make music starting get deal artist going happen next two three year . think , 's unlikely . think end goal -- 've become big enough artist coming . also divest part audio meaning like show like example , siriusxm great show spark howard stern . think show starting shift digital , 's see content margin really improving bottom line spotify also major player like apple amazon . anand srinivasan julie chariell got . thank , amine . within service piece pie , fintech apple pay , apple card associated business could currently exist big piece pie . wanted highlight sliver business think incredible growth opportunity , number one . number two , think covid amplifies growth opportunity , call julie chariell , fintech analyst potentially run opportunity set apple could sort inspirationally talk -- expansive nature business . julie , what's take ? sure . thanks , anand . market opportunity 're looking . really covid sort three offsetting trend . negative side , overall slowdown consumer spending . right . know thing bad , especially april getting little bit better may , 's sort negative right going recessionary environment . consumer spending slowing , could hurt kind spending via apple pay apple card . side , strong uptake electronic payment . people perceive safer using cash everything contactless , touch electronic payment , whether 's contactless credit card mobile phone wallet , accessing apple pay others . 's really begun take . positive uptake e-commerce , also necessitates use electronic payment . update e- commerce strong really actually growing even better -- better rate covid . far physical store closed . offsetting trend 're looking . let give quick number around . consumer spending side , going use mastercard proxy , 've giving good spending data . mid-april , basically bottom spending card , spending 26 % u 33 % internationally . fast forward mid-may . thing gotten much better . still . spending u 6 % mid-may 19 % internationally . kind ask , think sustainable ? right . difference ? international still much compared u many country around world begun opening ahead even u . case , look stimulus . mid-may 75 % stimulus check already distributed think given bit bump u spending , bigger bump , temporary one right . keep going , need re-openings kick -- come online without second wave virus really shutting thing perhaps even stimulus republican senate talking getting behind keep going . anand srinivasan julie chariellinternationally , see , much stimulus yet way apparently eu making move today , improvement international market bit slower , 's slow gradual re- opening . keeping perspective , better april , still something watched . look uptake . positive side , electronic payment growing . really interesting data point -- come past week . according mastercard contactless card use grew 40 % first quarter three time higher norm u two time higher international market . people using contactless card call tap pay . second quarter , visa said 60 % face face transaction tap pay contactless could easily include mobile wallet tap pay . 60 % face face transaction pay growth 40 % . 're seeing clear increase use electronic contactless payment . positive e-commerce side trend really , really impressive . number visa , refer card-not-present transaction essentially online transaction . spending 10 % first half april , 10 % second half april . exclude travel , spending 10 % first half april , sort worst second half april , 30 % . 's better . trend really driving important shift way people behave , 're moving away cash faster card mobile payment like apple pay rethink case well positioned company like apple help offset slowdown consumer spending overall . julie , 's -- mean sort case apple pay potentially expansion obvious , one thing growth rate staggering number one . apple want potentially apple card compare contrast apple could take -- trying become financing engine , leasing business equivalent dell hp provides customer financing , want apple card mind . compare contrast peer , potentially ? yeah . sort near-term picture longer-term picture . near- term picture apple card , little bit tough , 've offered deferral payment customer march april . 've heard 20 % cardholder taking advantage . 'll see loan loss reserve , ultimately , think 's lot opportunity card . already offering incentive holder apple card use apple card mobile wallet . apple pay , right give extra cash back incentive use . 's way start , use apple pay driving usage apple pay . anand srinivasan julie chariell anand srinivasan julie chariell anand srinivasanso 's one benefit apple card . time , company accumulating data consumer , right . 's accumulating data credit worthiness , -- much credit taking available -- available balance ? well paying ? paying time ? paying minimum payment could use data potentially consumer loan side likely partner bank , whether 's goldman another partner . look thing digital banking like offering saving offering investment account . way work apple pay well , right . apple pay extensively wallet .

've one pioneer offering installment payment . buy apple product installment , pay 24-months installment used elsewhere world , n't popular u , seem gaining nice traction apple sort unique thing data helping support general purchase apple product . one single add card think could interesting reward -- point kind opportunity . think hiring nature apple user , let 's say amex bringing retail partner retail partner offer incentive . apple cardholder get -- earn point use retail partner , could powerful ecosystem apple card . got . interesting thing , financing angle well breakup payment partial payment plan dramatic impact trade-in program dramatic impact helping iphone shipment . , -- yeah , -- value . thank , julie chariell . keeping -- keep along ipad . yes . thank . exactly . 's closed ecosystem . keeping , keep along ecosystem , right user apple keeping stickiness use platform . yes , thanks . got . thank , julie . 're going dive deep little bit go supply chain , little bit talk apple 's chip ambition . interesting quietly apple already top 10 semiconductor revenue company one customer . 's closed ecosystem . 's captive silicon provider , $ 8.5 billion revenue 2019 quote , unquote revenue compare favorably something like amd example , see stack pretty nicely leader space , obviously make kind chip mostly focused -- exclusively focused logic exclusively , power management technically analog . logic secondarily analog , one thing want point one , apple's chip ambition going rise 's going try make lot chip part ecosystem , 's number one . number two chip selection chip need made apple going necessarily long cost saving line exclusively . cheapest chip 're going made third party expensive chip going made apple 's necessarily constraint . think vector along apple going bring chip in-house one -- one tightness integration potential feature set apple enhance making chip , number one . number two potential cost saving number three , minimized cadence . remember talking company made wifi chip made cellular chip 15-years ago separate cadence integration potential cellular modem , wifi chip outside design constraint . answer one operated different cadence , cellular refreshed le le frequently wifi people wanted -- trade one benefit . result , wifi still integrated bluetooth , fm stereo , still integrated cellular modem . quick breakdown billing material iphone pro , iphone 11 pro max see app processor high end stack price perspective cost perspective . pmic , power management chip app processor well audio low end stack . potentially higher asp product could brought in-house , display , camera , et cetera , unlikely brought in-house cadence different specialty supplier thing , thing well 's best interest apple potentially bring back in-house . look supply chain , talking little bit extensively well . looking u supply chain left . supply chain volatile . 've multiple iteration everything touchpad ipod , track wheel power management audio codecs , supplier changed willy-nilly supposedly outside look way apple process change supplier , every two three year , dramatic consequence supply chain supplier course year two become substantially wedded apple business point 's nearly 80 % cirrus , 's 20 % broadcom , 's substantially 7 % intel . woo jin hoso substantial consequence apple , apple starting either specific design going cheaper price . result , make swap , consequence . one critical partner apple mind tsmc , even though 's small partner , enables manufacturing apple 's in-house design chip critical partner . given drama going trade war part 2 , may , tsmc 's involvement pressure point huawei 's manufacturing . could -- could consequence u china use tsmc pinch point . third point would make , going drive margin near term . -- even apple bring substantial portion chip manufacturing in-house chip design in-house , mix product business service business bigger driver margin relative impact chip in-sourcing versus . subject . -- want clear , actually gross margin potentially weakening . want woo jin ho come talk might potentially happen -- price likely change '20 calendar year 2020 've introduced low-end priced phone . price pressure numerator , cost pressure denominator weakens product 's margin -- service improvement key driver gross margin improvement apple business , want talk little bit potentially iphone franchise specifically could pain point cost billing material future generation iphone , specifically 5g . woo jin , 's take ? great . thanks , anand , hello everybody . , want silicon discussion apple , merchant silicon perspective touch 5g radio frequency chip actually go beyond chip would potentially basically billing material . billing material page . see apple aggressively spent certain area number one , application processor modem went , battery went well rf mixed signal went want throw apple chipmaker three big bucket . one , want differentiate operational performance perspective . include faster download speed may sustain radio frequency chip improvement every generation , better battery life , mean better plics [ ph ] newer architecture support subpmex [ ph ] time 'd like call hood chip . number two . want differentiate user experience sensory experience support service . think audio chip anand said amplifier phone , earpods airpods complement music service camera image sensor complement video photo application . -- apple always going invest kind chip . last bucket bringing new technology support existing upcoming service . spec iphone may lag . samsung may provide , also introduced really cool thing newer chip vendor provide . number one , think near field communication apple pay help . think touch id single touch evolved face id face id module potentially provide augmented reality application . apple perspective , 's always looking innovate iphone iphone ecosystem 's going best breed chip . however , merchant silicon perspective , anand said , piece famine . secured -- content iphone , 's fantastic . iphone volume high , decide -- entire portfolio low end high-end arpu represent $ 800 -- 180 200 million plus unit opportunity . sole supplier 's quickly going $ 200 million sale .
