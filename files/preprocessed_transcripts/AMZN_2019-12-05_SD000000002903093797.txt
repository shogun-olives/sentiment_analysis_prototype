'd calling sport phone every 5 minute , paying $ 1 minute hear score . actually , better said , dad paying $ 1 minute age . radically changed customer experience . love 've working next gen stats . question answer share kind 's evolved 've used next gen stats innovation change fan experience . well 's trying bring fan closer game give way engage game . want access , course . want information . aws able work u next gen stats able give u insight never : fast player running ; separation receiver defensive back may ; probability catch , saw screen started . think fan really taken . broadcaster taken . medium partner really interested take new data make better production make fan feel like 're part game understanding . get opportunity see somebody running 22 mile hour , think record year , according aws . 's -- n't know last time ran 22 mile per hour . recently . recently . -- see . really take away incredible athlete incredible thing . 's , think , power 've created . think 's many opportunity beyond u . agree . one favorite next gen stats catch probability metric . love -- new york giant fan , love next gen stats able use machine learning algorithm created aws project famous obj catch , odell beckham jr. catch , dallas 0.4 % catch probability , mean effectively , 4 1,000 time , would catch ball , pretty amazing . q - roger goodell - andrew jassy q - roger goodell - andrew jassyand roger said , 've spent lot time together organization continuing work evolve game part changing thing . -- 've looked together said , `` thing move needle ? '' talked lot . said , `` aws ' cloud computing machine learning capability nfl , regard historical current data insight game ? '' 're excited announce new strategic partnership together , going combine aws ' cloud computing machine learning nfl 's data insight game work transforming player health safety . 're excited 's possible . thought would useful help u understand partnership 're going together build 've already . 's , obviously , big priority nfl long time . well 's # 1 priority . make game safer current player , obviously , -- next-generation player . frankly , well beyond game football ? think make every sport safer frankly , even beyond . u , see power able take data we've created last decade extraordinary distant 's pure data . video attached . sensor . take combination , think possibility enormous . that's guy specialize . -- 's guy . 're pretty good football . 're pretty good collecting data . want use data change game . think 's 's exciting relationship . relationship get involved , partner nfl change game . 'll changing way 's played , 'll way 's coached , way prepare athlete game . although , think , going something 's going exciting look next 100 year nfl . yes . 're excited well potential . , obviously , important strategic priority . share little bit thought partner . process like ? well 'd happy hear . 're looking partnership , always look best class . compliment aws . q - roger goodell - andrew jassy q - roger goodell - andrew jassy q - roger goodell - andrew jassy q - roger goodellthank . yes . believe . look landscape , wanted go best class . 's # 1 u . two really feel strongly trying align interest partner . bring great technology . bring great machine learning , stuff n't nfl . want able work make 1 plus 1 equal 5. believe work well u . , obviously , want , end day , impact . want know relationship , impact aws , impact game together something powerful . yes . keynote tuesday , 'm sure watched livestream , yes . see . 's . 'm sure high ( inaudible ) , yes . told 2.5 hour , andy . watched ( ﬂight home ) . yes . along ( st. dodo ) . keynote , one thing talked 're making big transformation , really start foundationally leader deciding want make transformation setting aggressive goal top . one thing 've always impressed , roger , super curious technology . really , think 're quite happy game . also , every time talk , 're thinking change fan experience better leaning . 's , way -- mean , would say get chance meet lot leader lot industry . would think would norm . 's . really appreciate . 'm curious think innovation league think innovation . well 's sort -- giggling said -- know staff would giggle , seem happy game . never happy satisfied . always feel like nfl , particular , much potential . unlock potential . think 's relationship unlock work 've done building - andrew jassy q - roger goodell - andrew jassy q - roger goodelldatabase actually work extend effort , obviously , prevent injury , diagnose injury treat injury ; come better medical standard . better practice method better equipment . 're going hear engineer minute . work they've able create engineering road map improve game dramatic impact . 've already seen reduction concussion 30 % last year . 're continuing see lower extremity injury , really bulk injury . believe combining partnership make sure understand injury occur could prevent . even point , know much better , could create digital athlete ? could find predictive analysis allow u understand , possible individual susceptible injury ? maybe surface , cleat position . exciting u . 's far away . 's something think grasp . relationship , believe , accelerate . yes , agree . think , 's -- thing 'm excited we're going together using computer vision algorithm . alongside thing like ... 're going get head real quick . . alongside service like sagemaker build algorithm try predict cause concussion lower extremity injury digital athlete mentioned , , creating virtual composite model athlete . understand -- simulate different collision different angle different type play look like normal gate player versus somebody 's maybe impacted injury . , think , chance really transform player health safety . super excited partnership excited we're embarking together today . roger said , 're going call expert . 'm going welcome stage -- 'm going welcome jeff miller , 's executive vice president health safety innovation nfl ; dr. matt wood , 's vp ai service aws ; dr. jeff crandall , 's chairman engineering committee nfl . 're going share little bit detail . thank , . pleasure , andy . 's great . thanks . - andrew jassy q - jeff miller q - jeff crandall thank . god bless . +++presentation good afternoon . 'm jeff miller , executive vice president health safety innovation nfl . testify fact roger goodell relentlessly unsatisfied . 're going continue conversation started minute ago . want thank andy jassy , aws , team 've opportunity work 've developed partnership last month . could excited future hold football , health safety athlete game whole . , let introduce couple special guest going get detail around work . matt wood , vice president artificial intelligence aws ; good friend mine , dr. jeff crandall , 's chairman nfl 's engineering committee biomechanical engineer university virginia . +++qanda jeff , let start . know well , worked together long time . 3.5 year ago , nfl started project called engineering roadmap , effort supported -- multimillion dollar effort supported owner try better understand head impact concussion field design way mitigate impact , try move helmet industry forward . work intensive . think 've seen fair number -- fair amount success . jeff , 've point person work . share audience little bit effort far ? sure . think 's important understand 're starting . think look nfl , collect tremendous amount high-quality data . probably familiar share play game information . think go right player level . tremendous information equipment player wearing . helmet model ? cleat ? shoulder pad ? know player injury history . know 's happening , often practice . know 're field . know surface run . 've got tremendous database prepared . think top , one unique resource , q - jeff millerlook , archive video . game characterized every play multiple view camera . every player actually tracked multiple view camera angle . building , developed plan called engineering roadmap . goal really transform . improve current state head protection ? accelerate pretty rapid pace ? put plan together . part $ 100 million initiative league funded couple year ago . set 4 basic task . first task , let 's understand what's happening field . let 's characterize environment player getting injured . took video . took next gen stats saw . something called model-based image matching . really characterized getting injured , getting impacted , impacted . engineering basis , 've said , '' force ? motion involved player injured ? '' information , characterize on-field . next step share . share people actually make better helmet , better protective equipment ? took information . brought laboratory setting . laboratory setting meant recreate on-field environment using impactors crash test dummy manufacturer could take laboratory design . essentially , designing equipment let reﬂect on-field environment . think look state affair design right , 's longer world take prototype test experimentally . another work stream let 's bring computational environment . let 's use finite element . let 's recreate environment studied field virtual space . 're point understand 's happening field . tool , experimental computational . next step incentivize motivate development transformational helmet . last month , group u symposium , kicked $ 3 million nfl helmet challenge . really want motivate incentivize manufacturer , entrepreneur . brought together nation 's leading additive manufacturer ' 3d printing . 're hopeful next 18 month get transformational , revolutionary element better substantially anything 's field right . 's essentially engineering roadmap . one element anticipated started work collection different data set , head impact field gameplay data , equipment player wearing , frequency impact , speed player 're traveling , angle hit one another . work , laborious last couple q - jeff crandall q - jeff miller - matt wood q - jeff miller - matt woodyears looking upwards 700 800 concussion field , allowed u -- u looking identify trend data manually . jeff , want spend 30 second talking outcome real quickly . sure . think jeff mentioned identify trend opportunity . road map sort long-term plan , said sort ramp implement right make change game . one would , think , educational opportunity tested helmet annual basis . saw performed better others . top- performing group . think able , educational program player team understanding on-field data , able take player 41 % top-performing helmet 2017 moved 99 % player top-performing helmet year . another example might rule change worked . historically , look , kickoff return highest injury rate . looked video . looked next gen stats . something called clustering analysis , said , `` kickoff make dangerous play ? '' shared special team coach . shared competition committee . able come rule change play , could keep excitement remove riskiest scenario . think jeff mentioned tedious nature . 've looked 100,000 helmet impact manually . one challenge scale . accelerate ? think 's one reason 're excited aws partnership . leverage suite tool ? leverage 're ai machine learning help u drive innovation faster pace eﬃciently broadly ? matt , let 's turn . think agree looking 100,000 head impact film little bit crazy . probably suggest anybody , better way . quickly overwhelming . quickly overwhelming . let 's talk -- approach , see hear data work 've done far possibility ? q - jeff miller q - jeff crandallsure . mean , think , first foremost , thing 've impressed partnership far material work 've done far level drive innovation inside nfl . working biomechanical model , willingness explore wonder kind exploratory world together , think 've done great work . 'll continue going forward . machine learning perspective , machine learning , start data . data nfl generating ground truth data 've already got access , video trove . information , 's -- 's raw material continue extract meaning insight game like 've next gen stats . start take even , start integrate move towards improving player health safety . whilst 's tempting focus machine learning , machine learning frosting top . 's 20 % . 80 % data . 's store . one first thing 've working creating data lake , put data together single place , -- right access control right governance available sort computation , allows explore . get machine learning . 're wrong , machine learning -- 's like driving around light night without map . 's -- -- go anywhere want . explore . often take wrong turn . end dead end . 've trying service like sagemaker , particularly new announcement 've made week thing like sagemaker studio debugging profiling capability , model monitoring autopilot allows create model automatically , 're giving nfl map . 're turning light car . mean look around corner . group , aws machine learning solution lab expert nfl , start plot course towards safer game . 're going data 've collected . 're going using computer vision model predictive model 're going build sagemaker . jeff , one endpoint map matt talking we've conceived digital athlete platform , previous panel talked brieﬂy . opportunity , provides way n't think existed better understand human perform behave . potentially avoid injury find trend data based platform could potentially build together course partnership . give perspective minute ? sure . think look , nfl provides sort unique opportunity look human motion , force injury among population world 's elite athlete . challenge protect athlete . q - jeff miller - matt wood q - jeff miller - matt wood q - jeff millerconcept digital athlete 've heard , basic idea take virtual representation population athlete . able simulate potential change game across wide spectrum scenario , currently envision come future . heavily rely tool dr. wood mentioned , machine learning , computer vision , ai . ultimately , 'll able 'll able identify injury risk scenario . 'll able predict injury risk scenario . 'll able find innovation make game safer athlete maintaining high-quality play within game . think 's really overstatement say believe revolutionize way injury prevention , player rehabilitation play recovery nfl . matt , , obviously , focus myopically sometimes football . job take much broader look horizon tool like could developed together could application . yes . think conceive digital athlete ? sure . mean , hard overstate potential digital twin applying people . exactly 're digital athlete , opportunity create simulate ask different situation without putting real human risk able hundred million time get accurate result , 's incredibly inventive , broadly applicable technology . 'm excited get build together . opportunity across thing like workplace safety . opportunity like architecture building design , defense . perhaps one 'm interested applying broadly health care . biomechanical information , combined health care information , start wonderful thing start develop precise model treatment matter -- manner disease . general trend medicine moving broad collection treat patient group segment position treat individual , precise treatment , lead far better outcome patient . materially eﬃcient health care system . looking improve eﬃciency health care provide healthier people , fantastic technology . - matt wood q - jeff crandall q - jeff miller q - jeff crandall - matt wood q - jeff millerit 's incredibly exciting grand vision jeff started working engineering roadmap year , 've hard time imagining 'd sitting today world 's leader machine learning one innovative company ever partner , talk digital athlete digital athlete platform , portends next year . jeff , think journey come next , looking around corner , else could potentially talking couple year , -- aws bothered invite u back : invent encore performance ? 're welcome back , way . invitation open . think first thing need let video reviewer dark room watched 100,000 impact . 's true . 's true . think , look , mean , realize limitation right . mentioned amount data 's available nfl . think we're struggling look number database number resource . way come hypothesis . hypothesis test . realize limitation . 're really looking forward digital athlete platform , identifying pattern , identifying trend , identifying opportunity 're even aware . 's unknown ? think 're excited embark . absolutely . yes . exploration going long-term partnership . exploration quickly going disproportionately important . 's exciting . well wrap discussion , let thank everybody listening u . tell , 're incredibly excited journey 're going start aws . mentioned , 're invited back , welcome opportunity give everybody marker along way , try create thing n't created yet betterment football beyond . one thing 've pledged nfl incredibly transparent , 've gone journey around improving health safety sport world-class partner like aws . responsibility continue . .
