'll probably wanted another 10 time fully digest everything announced . omniverse seems like customer engagement broadened significantly since provided u update last time . remind u 're thinking contribution p & l ? realize relatively nascent long-term strategy guy ? think -- analyst think contribution revenue growth profitability going forward ? yeah . thanks , toshiya . three component omniverse platform . first component simulation platform , 's called ovx , omniverse computer . ovx first generation prototype , volume scale based second generation ovx-2 powered ada , l40s , cx-7 bluefield-3 . without belaboring reason term performance giant leap ampere saw keynote . based rendering performance really incredible . 're full production , 're ramping trying get ovx computer customer fast . quite large number customer signed receive ovx computer . second component omniverse application built top . application span entire range design , build operate inside company . 're designing car designing factory designing product way manufacturing operating , omniverse involved . believe omniverse one first - simona jankowski q - timothy arcuri - simona jankowski - jensen huang q - timothy arcurienterprise application next web browser , , next web application span practically every organization . fact , showed example design involved , marketing involved , product configuration involved , manufacturing involved simulation operation well . 's every single organization opportunity engage omniverse work single source truth . second application , 're typically user . third application new type database called omniverse nucleus , put cloud we're going host managed service . think nucleus database , new type database 's interactive , 's shared . pull bring -- data -- three dimensional data metadata whatever behavior data , physic data relationship data , supplier data component go supplier , et cetera . bring data associated product building could ( inaudible ) , could jt file , characterizes 3d geometry . could erp system associate vendor go component . bring data nucleus . nucleus shared people use , 's active distributed database , 3d , 's world 's first large scale usd database . business model probably like cloud database business model . people connected , 'll storage component associated 'll used component associated . nuclear -- think cloud database announced today , omniverse cloud would hosted cloud omniverse cloud basically database . 're process fine-tuning pricing associated one -- case system part well understood . case pricing application service 're process fine tuning case nucleus database cloud , process fine tuning well . sense -- , conventional compared like thing 've described . thank . next question tim arcuri ubs . thanks lot . hear ? yes . yes , tim . - colette kress - jensen huangperfect . awesome . jensen , think big theme really new infrastructure service offering bionemo omniverse cloud . guess two question . first , maybe colette , update u -- think said back march , think said $ 100 million year revenue run rate gave recurring software service revenue . first question , give u update ? second , jensen , 'm sort curious business model stuff . going offer instance aws cloud ultimately seems like maybe offer cloud ? seems like maybe sort inï¬‚ection look like csp hyperscaler . thanks lot . , tim , thanks question . let first start first part question , talked earlier , already run rate software service provide . number couple $ 100 million 're going continue grow . great new offering even today , also offering 've working time well . 'll move jensen talk little bit . yeah . remember accelerated computing full stack computing approach . method using brute force transistor advance moore 's law largely ran course . going forward , opportunity continuing variety , price performance curve moore 's law ended . wanted able larger scale computing cost effective way , 15 year -- almost 20 year pursuing already computing . think , broadly , almost conventional wisdom accelerated computing really path forward opportunity u stay moore 's law go much turbocharged accelerated computing law . artificial intelligence , course benefited , molecular dynamic benefited , weather climate simulation going benefit . many different thing -- different field ray tracing nvidia 's business , core business computer graphic benefited tremendously . -- first part , 's full stack challenge . -- architecture available every cloud partnership cloud vendor csps really two part . internal consumption part , using nvidia 's accelerated computing stack accelerate workload . could recommender system , could speech ai , could large scale query course emergence large language model , question important ai model decade . important ai application decade . 's internal consumption . external consumption public cloud , nvidia partner . , maybe even extended sale marketing force csps -- ecosystem , evangelism platform software - simona jankowski q - w illiam stein - jensen huangdevelopers startup 12,000 , 13,000 startup work -- built nvidia . company using nvidia 's accelerated computing go cloud . essentially business attractor , significant part public cloud service . 're going continue . several area believe might able simplify democratize reach nvidia 's accelerated platform , 's fairly complicated put system together -- couple public cloud . two area associated large language model , announced today , nvidia managed service . managed service would basically , think ai training , domain specific ai training designed super good large language model . effort cost training nvidia service running cloud 'll run initially -- 're going run service cloud . use service , could substantially reduce cost training large language model training called prompt , tune large language model specific application . second thing omniverse requires giant amount engineering 've working year bring omniverse cloud currently running aws . goal run cloud , partnership csps benefit opportunity attract customer using omniverse . , couple different area , large language model per se -- looking english , well language also chemistry biology . also omniverse platform complicated . thought would stand nvidia managed service make lot easier cost effective people use . 'll probably lot going forward , especially area , hard . thank . next question come stein truist . great . thank taking question 'll add thanks incredible announcement made today . , maybe little bit confusing u , many -- quite technical . jensen made one curious -- think related autonomous driving transitioning ( inaudible ) thor . detail condition led decision ? maybe also remind u progress big customer announcement year ago , think talked mercedes-benz adopting technology maybe remind u similar relationship built level oems might missed . thank . yeah . thanks lot . 'll roll backwards . mercedes-benz ship first car 2025 , late '25 . also announced jlr , brand jlr entire ï¬‚eet brand going also powered nvidia 's full stack - simona jankowski q - aaron rakers - jensen huang q - aaron rakersshortly 2025. 're pushing forward . also orin designed 40 different car company . mention medical instrument iot edge ai server robotics kind . orin chip self-driving -- self-driving car stack really phenomenal homerun started ramping couple quarter ago 's going ramping quite fast going forward . think something like $ 11 billion pipeline next several year , associated orin system associated within software associated . reason decided change atlin [ ph ] , next generation orin brand new architecture three processor inside robotics processor . one gpu , one cpu , one tensor core . three processor made enormous leap last two year . made hard decision swarm put three new technology , rather waiting another two year . robotic system cycle time two year . every two year , announced major leap . , n't want miss . atlin , previous version , based next generation orin , missed . decided bite bullet really hunker work hard much u . could n't bear waiting another two year , mean 's kind simple fact . project , project heart love love building . 's incredibly hard work lot imagination go , lot passion hard work go . could n't imagine waiting another two year get hopper grace ada . -- decided . 's reason 's probably -- probably could say 60 % passion could n't bear bringing technology world 40 % hard work , lot hard work , passion overcame hard work . thank , jensen . next question come aaron rakers well fargo . yeah . thank . hear ? yes , aaron , nice hear . thank . thanks call . want go 've talked today hopper full production account like , guess , maybe first question confirm pace hopper ran [ ph ] largely anticipated , given question around china export - jensen huangsituation . second question , think hopper product cycle think breadth platform strategy nvidia built , think pricing strategy hopper relative ampere ? opportunity continue take bigger piece data center footprint hopper materializes likely next several quarter ? yeah . first , hopper five time throughput [ ph ] new type engine called transformer engine . transformer important model today . really largely replaced ( inaudible ) lcm surely also replace lot computer vision-based algorithm . 's 5x speed -- 's 5x increase throughput , 's 3x increase reduction -- excuse , 3x reduction total cost ownership . reason , inside data center , aside hopper , chip know . look hopper system , 's entire system built . disassembled took complex part called hopper hgx board eight hopper , ten thousand component . 's insanely complex ship whole thing hopper ( inaudible ) . system go data center , data center includes cable networking switch power supply storage forth power delivery infrastructure forth . 5x throughput , three time lower tco implies hopper 's price higher ampere . -- think value proposition fantastic . net reduces cost compared last generation substantially mentioned . let 's see ramp , full production ship quantity quarter ship quantity next quarter . signal csps oems enterprise really solid . reason , one primary driver . ampere n't benefit ramp , hopper benefit , brand new revolutionary new model called transformer . probably looking seeing web , impact unreasonable performance , , large language model able learn new skill shot learning example learning . secondarily , ability generate image . number application coming industry really quite incredible . benefit time almost industrial wide recognition large language model democratized ai , made easy almost anybody use ai . hopper really , going -- advance large language model democratize application , inference cost much lower . mention one vibrant industry moment probably incredibly well funded segment world startup digital biology . watching industry probably recognize digital biology went revolution cost gene sequencing breakthrough predicting structure protein structure chemistry able understand language biology chemistry . turbocharged drug discovery segment therapeutic segment . pricing lot start-ups go remains really , really vibrant . anyways hopper going revolutionary application . - simona jankowski q - c.j . muse - jensen huang next question come c.j . muse evercore . please go ahead . good morning . thank taking question congrats formal launch ada lovelace . front would love stick gaming , jensen . third generation -- ray tracing . talk competitive landscape ? guess , maybe bigger picture considering kind inventory correction 're going . speak kind anticipated ramp timing 4090 , 4080 perhaps thinking 4070 mainstream coming online ? thanks much . yeah . -- took action last quarter quarter prepare channel great launch . know , 've substantially reduced selling ampere allow channel normalize . market -- end market soft 're soft would n't allow u opportunity sell excess inventory channel . took specific action marketing program particularly reduce segment ada going , initially . typically -- ada different , typically ramp top . 's enthusiast would like see brand new product customer refresh frequently every couple year , would like see new product . 's also segment need ramp omniverse omniverse workstation omniverse server forth . sensible place u ramp first . 'll ramp ada nicely , starting little bit quarter largely next quarter , robustly going , leaving year going next year .
