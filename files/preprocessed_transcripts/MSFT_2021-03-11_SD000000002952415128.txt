's component 's voice ip come part standard skus standard packaging team . component widely used . 's underlying technology power meeting , whether 's one-on-one group meeting , whatever set . 's -- often learned voice ip type setting constantly used . soon people exposed even chat , realize button escalate either voice , video . widely , widely used . another component team idea become phone system . phone system add , well know , kind call control type feature . add lot sophistication term think telephony network , 're plugging provider . - samad samana - jared spatarowe talk 're . phone system requires separate purchase . purchased standalone purchased part call enterprise fiber e5 sku . 've seen tremendous , tremendous strength momentum e5 lately . kind come angle . see lot opportunity , like competitor 're seeing right company making important decision . started meeting , samad , approximate need immediate need pandemic . many , many customer rolling great . 've decided 're going meeting , chat , 're going take phone . -- see kind 2021 year phone many way . understood . 's -- 's getting , pbx-like functionality , right , suddenly , go across whether 's pstn network whether take call coming inside organization . think , least based diligence 've done , microsoft tackling multiple way . mentioned , part effort e5 , also , think 're working ucaas provider allow direct routing inside team . maybe think open environment approach . automate software ? -- 'll 's best customer ? approaching using partner direct routing using microsoft e5 license ? yes . let 's look segment perspective . might good place start look kind platform strategy . segment level , broadly divide 2 segment . smb enterprise , kind gross way dividing world . smb level , find overall need market simplicity . customer really need . going pay large project 's going come bunch integration pulling existing system , even integration , example , telephony provider . 're really interested something simple . case , find simplicity trump . work 're product allows simplicity kind higher base . - samad samana - jared spataroso , space , end seeing microsoft telephony provider , , major draw customer . sophisticated smbs . also offer option call direct routing , allows bring telephony provider . sophisticated smbs want , absolutely offer . would say offer gaining traction would simplest , allows u telephony provider . enterprise , landscape much complex need , , complex sophisticated . , 100 % focused customer want , think best . kind learned lesson tried first round skype business many year ago , tried go alone . time , learned lot industry contour industry . thing changed many way , yet thing remained well . simple example , many customer multiyear contract telephony provider . contract important . go far telephony , voice service thing like data . find would like actually bring telco , 'd like plug back team , 're willing . fact , 're willing . 're going around world top operator , telco operator , 're proactively working ensure go market together . perspective , look , want customer want . 're focused opportunity opposed forcing particular model . understood . think mentioned bring carrier initiative allowing direct routing . think microsoft removing either hurdle removing friction , call , core phone system user . maybe extent , could maybe talk see maybe additional hurdle may kept customer moving point , continuing come 're jumping . yes , 's really good one . would say one thing hurdle point idea going manage - samad samanacommunication infrastructure , -- communication infrastructure . pre-pandemic , company actually n't super coherent strategy . found walked customer typically , 're fairly large customer , would department responsible collaboration , department responsible telephony 2 would n't necessarily talk . might even separate department thing like webinars kind external meeting . pandemic done 's forced folk start talk necessity . figure going meeting , phone ring somebody pick dial work number ? get ? get ? really started push people reconsider even hardware investment , samad . another kind thing brought back wow , 've invested hardware oﬃce phone sitting desk . sudden , phone hardware one component overall solution . going forward , see customer already planning call hybrid work model 're anticipating -- fact , found research 80 % company believe 'll much ﬂexible work home policy post-pandemic . 70 % worker safely , 'll take employer least week . turn like thing previously saw blocker sudden kind become -- like fade background little bit . premier scenario end , follow employee wherever , provide telephony service advanced kind collaboration communication service get job done . think lowered barrier 've seen anything else . becomes discussion , okay , 's approach ? 's philosophy ? team come pitch essentially unified platform . give data point . jefferies publicly already said allow u ﬂexible . one 70 % take . hope get telephony inside team . maybe think -- segmented market smb enterprise . sound like smbs , 's maybe lower barrier want life easier . think enterprise side , anything scalability standpoint 's preventing putting pbx using e5 adding voice functionality ? simply market n't moved yet ? - jared spataro - samad samana - jared spataro general , would say 've gotten place feel really good technology . feel like 're competitive versus folk see market would competing business . certainly n't feel like type scalability difference longer . younger , nascent solution couple year ago , building phone system capability . today , feel really good . place see last probably 12 month , 've making consistently announcement essentially platform area . think team platform extensible . go phone system well . see people specialized need look phone system . simple example would call center contact center need , need integrate ( solution ) provider . also might specific regulatory requirement call recording . 're going compliance run shop really important . aspect thing start see move truly becoming someone 's phone system really taking role . 're feeling really good . n't thing , like competitor n't . instead , offer team platform work really hard , , proactively go independent software provider . say , hey , partner work together integration customer n't one time . helpful . speaking partner , accenture important microsoft partner . think last earnings call , company mentioned 85,000 user using team make call going . -- mean stand marquee example . curious extent share 're approaching putting voice team ? maybe could elaborate large organization changed approach voice inside team ? yes , bet . , starting point people voice inside team end voice ip .

've working better click join experience even use hardware specialize working hardware partner specialized hardware certified team well . 's lot real goodness . see main draw going back kind -- would call secular trend people going shift back forth home work time , big question , ring . somebody's going dial , bring work number ? phone desk ringing , 're working home day , creates kind essentially work stoppage type situation . order enable new mode working , believe lot folk going starting evaluate , -- essentially , telephony system follows people wherever ring appropriately integrated else , type thing . accenture , feel like great indicator . 's great signal market 's going . talked earlier boy see issue term scale great example scale point . thing 'll say use team really interesting see people using telephony , start use platform aspect business . 40 apps created microsoft power apps published team . apps focused simplifying key workload . reason bring key workload simplified integrate telephony simplification . 's built . 's another thing kind serf tip people realize , sort integrated solution . start even oﬃce automation . find bumping wall want bring collaborate communication platform enable . helpful . kind maybe sticking partner side . lot ucaas tends sold master agent value-added resellers , 'm curious microsoft working partner historically least important distribution . much guy willing , guess , match commission structure , maybe aggressive vendor ? - jared spataro - samad samana - jared spataro - samad samana yes . certainly seen dynamic , samad . lot people come , competitor come either maintain type margin structure , say , even aggressive . perspective really strategic workload u . partner strategic . sometimes think 're coming top , n't need partner anymore . 's strategy . believe ecosystem 's currently constituted serf customer well . need enable ecosystem able use solution . course last couple quarter , 've working hard making sure 're competitive . company , 're kind casing market understanding current margin structure look like . 've making sure 're line margin structure competitive . 're feeling good . would say little bit slow block couple year ago ramping team platform , product . folk ahead u , particularly incumbent ahead channel . 're feeling -- 'm feeling good channel momentum last couple quarter , see result . one last thing , 'll pick point , think order really transform part market , 'll go market partner .

'll jump question list . 's large installed base , cover actually company called audiocodes , help converting customer sbcs . think base opportunity convert . team , also putting telephony well ? absolutely . anytime base , want careful base 're going make decision one way . exactly . - jared spataro - samad samana - jared spataro make mistake strategically mind , quarter quarter quarter ago , even pandemic started , really accelerated pandemic . skype business base one 've paying lot attention . go special help give migrate team . see many -- even 're ready migrate fully team , they'll decide move meeting team , instance , keep persistent chat skype . -- 'd expect , program help . good customer , best customer , loyal , want everything . review often internally look base , stand . continue stay skype business , systematically making sure 're resolving blocker . important u , 're going make decision . great . think time maybe couple question . 'll read one -- investor set . trying figure may role existing ucaas company team world , right ? let 's assume world becomes team world . view -- like many -- percentage move voice team . percentage think come direct service provider versus ucaas provider like ringcentral 8x8 direct route team ? yes . let -- 'll disambiguate little bit detail . talk direct routing , focused telecom operator , telco operator . 's offering focused . talk , hey , 's direct routing opportunity , 'll go telco work customer telco . n't trying work 's essentially double hop , sort call control 's coming later ringcentral . fact , would say n't make much sense people use team , one competing company telco provider . clarify . would basically say see people making decision whether stay current ucaas provider telephony provide , telco operator go essentially microsoft decision - samad samana - jared spataromicrosoft telco provider someone in-country . 's approach . n't see much coexistence account 're going move telephony cloud . think make decision . understood . think helpful clarity . maybe one last one . data critically important organization . 'd curious view value proposition rich employee -- usage data inside team , whether 's collaboration , whether 's phone call within organization , call going internal external . 're able leverage rest microsoft ecosystem value proposition . ultimately , mean , 's -- many way , set , samad , appreciate . ultimately , u , , , zoom way even beyond team , team part microsoft 365. single important asset believe microsoft 365 offer customer call microsoft graph . graph constructed people use apps service microsoft 365 daily basis . aggregate signal associated , 2 thing . number one , feed back individual give value-added service help get job done . 's almost like personal assistance cloud . copywriter , editor , designer , analyst help get work done . second feed back aggregate de-identified way organization . tell , instance , hey , turn , organization seems starting work 30 minute earlier six month ago . know stress , instance . microsoft graph key . signal get graph , valuable becomes . reference , announced couple quarter ago 30 billion minute day spent microsoft 365 call collaboration minute . synchronous asynchronous collaboration , including calling we're referring , 've kind majored part call . every bit signal help u sharpen service 're giving individual organization . - samad samana - jared spataroand ultimately , look strategy , strategy . ( people ) ( inaudible ) idea data new oil . think 's data . would say data insight help improve performance individual organizational level . well , jared . think 's perfect place end . took u top hour . really appreciate time today , thought shared u . wish best luck . thanks , samad . appreciate . thanks .
