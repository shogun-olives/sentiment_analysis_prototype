'll open q & well . background , colette named cfo year leading silicon valley magazine last year . 'm really delighted could join u conference . , colette , start question go q & . welcome . thank . thank . much . question answer maybe start , want , every company , give -- get quick overview thinking second half . go second half , think positive , cautious , even ? simple one-word answer . go fundamental . think 's always hard use one word talk think everybody realizes nvidia quite diverse portfolio different thing looking q - vivek arya - colette m. kress q - vivek aryaat . 's run-of-the-mill type thing 're . look business focused focus ai , think great driver second half really 're talking next decade longer . think feel good term future hold well position traveling next decade . got . going different segment business , starting gaming . key question , gaming secular cyclical ? one school thought say , well , gaming done well last year major upgrade game console . cyclical , they're getting level maturity . secular part , well , gaming worldwide phenomenon . 's social phenomenon . look business ? cyclical ? secular ? right way think pc gaming ? yes . think look gaming transformation become even last decade . last 3 five year , 've seen really large movement gaming , moving person computer person term console . 're looking social platform . looking way entertainment . social platform , entertainment , come new way use underlying pc platform play game . esports evolved , people essentially watching others play game . online friend playing strategically game necessarily focus term graphic intensity . 's entertainment area . u.s. sport , see gaming worldwide phenomenon . kind gamers coming onboard . 're different level . 're playing different type gaming . region around world continues play game differently . different type subset asia-pac area , centered household , 've centered entire around pc . 's important part entertainment . know , u.s. , like abundance . use console , use pc , use tablet , use phone . underlying position pc seen ability continue improve gaming instantaneously new gpu capable within platform versus something static 4 five year . continued drive overall industry build better better game overall horsepower performance get overall gpu . think 'll continue see . content important . overall ecosystem important . necessarily piece hardware . know , spent significant amount time investing ecosystem investing actual gamer , gamer want see . think 'll see continue . got . recent analyst day , showed data said gaming grown 30 % plus compounded last five year . think semiconductor , 're really used seeing kind growth . 's always wary seeing kind number . sort break term unit content . unit grown double-digit pace . refresh - colette m. kress q - vivek arya - colette m. kress q - vivek arya - colette m. kressthe existing base ? think market actually expanding , bringing new gamers market ? way , measuring ? yes . 's really good point . think 's always really hard given -- sector set term semiconductor . talk 30 % , people pause go , `` 's really large number . '' one extra number . 's really large number gaming , think 's larger faster overall gaming term industry . 're pleased term performance . yes . expansion overall tam expansion overall market gaming use gpus gaming absolutely increased . great opportunity refresh much installed base , hundred million gamers around world , installed base across many different version architecture last architecture , maxwell . even prior . given performance improvement seen maxwell pascal , current architecture , 's abundance reason would upgrade . see higher-end type game coming . 's great opportunity come , overall , buy . see see gamers coming wave 2 , wave term team really peer coming onboard , one one . yes . sell one one . find group friend overall playing . find advancement broadband . know u.s. , broadband prolific around everywhere . 's many region world . looking entertainment finally getting online , gaming great place start . 're also seeing gamers come term . got . joining nvidia . told gamer unit grown double-digit pace last five year , would make think next five year ? well think try understand predict target going forward . think 's always really hard thing . double digit , think say 've got probably pretty substantial installed base . time , continue term innovation term gpu advancement term graphic , great opportunity continue think term upgrade going forward expanding overall base . gaming across many , many different gender . people age term gaming . still continuation refreshing also ability think console console plus pc term gaming . 's would look . q - vivek arya - colette m. kress q - vivek arya - colette m. kress got . term content growth mixup seen , another interesting stat analyst day today , median gaming card 're , 's $ 180 , used $ 140 . there's definitely expansion content . seen content expansion accelerate pascal ? something pascal either made people upgrade faster upgrade richer card prior cycle ? yes . still facing great folk upgrading upgrading higher-end card may previous version . great opportunity overall price per performance . massive increase performance . dollar 's worth term able purchase . know game , game available even second half future , allows buy something play significant amount time . seen , yes , continued rise period time asp . get asked question time say , `` well peak ? '' answer , , still significant amount volume skus really term providing gaming every single type gamer , matter kind dollar amount may coming table , make tremendously rich experience , much richer experience would even 10 year ago . volume skus definitely overall mean . significant amount skus also allow u even term within top end . anywhere $ 100 $ 1,000 , gaming card . sometimes , 's game 're playing . sometimes , best sku 's . , let 's say , gaming card ultimately meant replace console . console $ 300 , $ 400 , $ 500 , think $ 180 potential get towards console like $ 300 , $ 400 , $ 500 point ? diversity customer developed market , emerging market , right conceptual way thinking $ 180 go ? yes . 're try say , `` want term console retail price term . '' continue assured understand gamers , understand price point , understand type game . provide technology better price , we'll . think see 's definitely area higher price point rather static last decade even longer , still opportunity . 's necessarily goal . want make sure 're well connected gamer term type game want , community want providing brand establishes whatever game want play work seamlessly term technology . q - vivek arya - colette m. kress q - vivek arya - colette m. kress got . last one , quick one gaming . 're -- would say pascal adoption faster maxwell kepler adoption ? n't , think pc gaming business , right , geforce business , grow year ? know comp tough . last year , growth even far mid-30s growth . know comp tough year . pascal penetration still peak level , think geforce business potential grow year ? yes . tended look overall gaming result several architecture . continued find something consistency . try architecture usually market couple year , couple year term building refresh discussion overall gamers . tend put new gaming card , 've seen u even already pascal , entertain . 're still early stage pascal . pascal n't even reached full 3 quarter market . 're still seeing significant amount refreshes . discussed term investor day earnings , yes , right , pascal , term refresh , little bit faster maxwell . people pause say , `` expected ? say ? '' 's exactly expected , 're pleased term . say 're right line multi-year architecture continue rolled endorsed different gamers . still time term . know 's coming second half year term game . know work gaming developer bringing market . need see pascal see capability write game . spend lot time working many month ahead time overall game available . pascal , working , well . think , yes , second half fiscal year '16 tremendous second half . pascal gaming probably growing 60 % year-over-year . , pretty large number semiconductor company , i.e. , u . , think , overall vibrance overall gaming market still well , well intact term driver . we'll see look . got . lastly competition . amd launched polaris-based product last year . planning launch vega-based product year . seeing difference competitive dynamic versus amd ? seeing become -- coming discussion talk customer ? look competitive landscape ? anything changed ? yes . 've competing amd many , many , many year . probably pretty significant change term 2 company address market five year ago . really started think entire ecosystem really focusing gamers . looked capability performance would drive overall gaming market . seen . q - vivek arya - colette m. kresswe seen game portfolio significantly higher people would thought good enough . 're nowhere near good enough term overall graphic , term capable . know compete . compete differently . rarely see u come say , `` spec . semiconductor spec . '' really kind come say , `` platform . 're going enable gamer . '' attracted many super high-end gamers . we've also attracted everybody understands loyalty brand loyalty term bring . amd talked becoming competitive talked bringing thing . n't seen yet . 's year term within discussion . , feel confident term market ability continue innovate gaming market leadership term gamers . got . maybe let 's move next topic . datacenter gotten lot attention . think nvidia 's core sort sustainable differentiator datacenter ? hear lot company sounding better hardware benchmark consumer saying , `` look , beholden software tool . open-source tool , et cetera . '' guy done well last two year . help sustain market share position market ? yes . 's great way look great way think . think 're datacenter different overall gaming , gaming overall application user term gpu . surfacing using gpu term compute . 's lot factor occurred industry , market enabled experiencing right . term development many , many year reached part . 's chip actually surfaced six month ago coming next six month . think long-standing work create platform development platform top . people thought 10 year ago , rolled cuda across every single one gpus development able program gpus ? would need ? would ? well 10 year making , 500,000 developer around world , 's , 's clear understanding . taught , taught term higher education research early people many customer base selling truly understand power gpu . 's another key area happened period time started talk moore 's law . question started say , `` wait minute , continue ? '' focus acceleration different form order accelerate computing 's going take u -- substantial amount data key focused u concentrate . thirdly , use gpus use parallel processing understanding program surfaced era ai surfaced deep learning , deep learning research , deep learning focus ai , accomplishment able last 20 year , reach superhuman capability form q - vivek arya - colette m. kressdetection , image detection voice translation . -- leveraging gpu using , put u today , okay ? 've continued focus hardware . hardware probably top-notch . 's probably leap year ahead others term hardware capability . 's another key important part , software development layer come . focus ai democratizing ai say , `` want use ? type framework want use ? type industry ? type workload want ? '' . focused different type data type work seen using gpus . , good installed base right . secondly , people coming u wanting taught , wanting taught say , `` get started ? '' 're different era probably 15 20 year ago type computing error previous play . cloud important . people used think going fall place could get compute . reality 's way enterprise get started . say , `` take long time restart different configuration world . '' moving directly cloud moving getting started either remaining cloud , moving on-premise vice versa , easily done 've continued focus , delivering tesla platform . also enabling cloud instance using gpus also term ai supercomputer . 's reason we're seeing 're . 's one thing . , n't hear 's spec , 's hardware . 's lot different piece put together established overall competitive position . we're continuing run hard establish next decade well . one good thing cloud customer good customer adopt technology quickly . roll quickly . sometimes , downside also lot capable semiconductor engineer inside company , like google , instance . decided develop chip . think sort limited competitive concern ? think broader competitive concern ? market play next year versus sort merchant silicon platform solution versus customer deciding thing internally certain application ? yes . customer case google , 've working ai era time , 4 five year , really trying work . many customer significant amount installed base gpus . known continue come new form quickly possible . continue enhance overall performance overall capability workload . n't surprise u , though , would look something may engineered may subset overall gpu could use specific workload internal application . 're also going focus probably certain framework popular -- tensorflow , example , google . keep mind , 're going focus availability . want availability start one cloud , move another cloud , move on-premise . n't want limited overall framework . q - vivek arya - colette m. kress q - vivek arya - colette m. kress q - vivek arya - colette m. kresssome framework work well image detection . work well natural language processing . want enable rather limiting . think overall horsepower term team engineer , engineer hardware also even substantial amount software much one company core asset could even focus . early day , n't surprise u try custom asics custom one-off 'll . , 're mass different enterprise without limiting choice term may need . got . last quarter , seen datacenter business well . -- investor sell-side surprised . guy also surprised ? surprised ? would say see excitement around ai . continue really think forward term . say , sometimes , kind get accustomed large number little bit large growth number think that's normal . kind forget , guess , 's normal . grew sequentially , datacenter , 38 % . people , like , , sequential , 38 % . said , `` yes , guess 're right . large number . n't ? '' model next quarter ... said term last quarter . keep mind , still tremendous evolving business . get asked time , `` know visibility ? '' get asked often say , `` well going provide 3-year guidance 1-year guidance ? '' said , `` think 're pretty good 1 quarter guidance . let 's keep . 'll let know change . anytime soon , okay ? '' see . broadly , look datacenter business past , think lot exposed hpc enterprise . think deep learning part really taken . went period lumpiness period strong secular growth . point start worrying seasonality customer concentration ? -- like already good sense back half going shape ? still think still dependent certain customer making certain decision could create wide swing number could , positive negative ? q - vivek aryayes . think look datacenter business breadth depth expansion last several year within datacenter business . still phenomenal high-performance computing business . high-performance computing business probably continue conversion ai . high-performance computing focus primarily deep mathematical computation , diﬃcult thing oil exploration and/or thing term biggest supercomputer around world . may instance use ai shortcut different precision may need term going forward . talked last quarter , business doubling year-over-year . people looked , say , `` well must fastest . '' said , `` . remember , indicated entire datacenter business almost tripling . '' , 're talking large growth number . doubling smaller almost tripling . also grid business . grid business say 's one many need , putting gpu cloud serving multiple type user extract gpu cloud instance . seeing workstation cloud . seeing application cloud . seeing pc cloud , security reason . financial service key able protect overall information . overall collaboration need able see information cloud work globally continues fuel overall virtualization need graphic-intensive type application may surfaced . 's second business . business focused ai , focused ai internal hyperscales . talk best say , `` yes . 're working hyperscales . '' one ? say , `` yes . 're working hyperscales across world . '' broadens . broadens term , yes , internal work . also mean enabling cloud instance . every single cloud service provider putting wide range instance available using gpu computing see significant amount demand . say see significant amount demand , people requesting . hyperscales important piece . 're multifaceted , multiple term creating search ai-enabled apps , natural language processing . also 're term enabling type enterprise research may use overall cloud . lastly , remember , ai supercomputer . enable enterprise really think start rebuilding overall infrastructure ai ? 've approached containerized version . plug , string together . actually move quite quickly term getting overall ai . breadth depth overall customer set . seen overall investor day , talked 8x increase term number customer working across overall business last couple year . span different business . ca n't say n't individual project , course , . course , individual project add produce . 's 1 2 different customer . 's big , big group happening time . one thing saw gaming business gamers moved pascal , good expansion content value providing . see something similar datacenter side ? n't think pascal - colette m. kress q - vivek arya - colette m. kresswidely adopted datacenter quite yet . customer move pascal volta , expect similar expansion content ? yes . 's different beast talk enterprise nature infrastructure versus gamer . essentially , right , selling gaming world sell pascal . n't necessarily keep multiple different architecture . gamers want recent . good job transition assure slow architecture ramp . enterprise , 's bit different , okay ? 're talking qualifying many architecture within infrastructure . qualification assuring term spec want see individual workload individual application . match everything else datacenter . assure security need term within overall datacenter . take time . take time term working subset 10 moving slightly bigger project saying , `` i'm ready full rollout . '' 're going move faster , though . continue , kepler maxwell pascal volta , see overall market . n't really changed anything enterprise part . selling different architecture still tremendous value , cost saving getting architecture even though 's new architecture coming around corner . would stall said , `` hi . got go move newest one . '' continue qualifying term current . 'll continue work term seating new architecture coming make sure meeting overall need . receive feedback term incorporate term . 's different cycle enterprise term gaming . got . maybe minute left , colette , wanted hit 2 question . one automotive business one financials . automotive business , think work shape ? sort nvidia camp , right , signed lot customer autonomous driving . intel mobileye camp . customer making decision ? either/or ? complementary ? think work shape ? yes . 's interesting question think everyone always assumes competition equal 's exact type thing . think last three year focus term autonomous driving mindset overall evolved period time , probably three year ago , well , thought say , `` well camera , get driving without driver . get autonomous driving . '' important subset car manufacturer start-ups said , `` actually , need compute . need significant amount compute diﬃcult computing problem . '' amount data coming together need triangulated find pathway overall car travel importance . 's detecting q - vivek aryaeverything along road . detecting stop sign , detecting sidewalk n't help drive . tell 's road . pathway , brain think different parameter best method overall drive . emerged well-known understanding may seated seen partnership side taking smart camera possibly term taking compute . 's nothing market . 're third version platform today . 225 different partner , oems , start-ups , research term working . start-ups important part . many purchased . many approaching automotive industry different many approached last 20 year . may care term wheel , car frame , actual engine . may thinking term software brain come together . platform , similar work datacenter , focused software . focused term best option term production level compute . 's taking large supercomputer opening trunk moving grocery sticking . 've got get form factor exist . mastered working many partner term software think want bring car . 've got first production car road tesla platform move . hardware enables way level 4 exact hardware today continue build . 'll get point depreciating car . car actually getting better time . 've announced significant partnership audi , daimler recent one saw , toyota . n't small player . important , . 've seen , though , auto manufacturer move 2030 problem 2025 problem 2020. 's 2020 want get market , 're probably point enough time . 're going see decide . need decide quickly move line , manufacturing line detail get reach point . push little bit earlier , push probably time 'll lagged little bit . 's 're going see . still forming partnership challenging . think way think automotive , though , ability work auto manufacturer understand support tier 1 , understand high-definition mapping partner key . 's lot people coordinated . think 's really challenging think multiple partner actually delivering solution . 's complicated type working together term . think 're pleased full end-to-end platform done tremendous amount support partner far . last one term use cash . definitely , since 've gone 1/3 question , 's lack organic growth opportunity nvidia . 's also lot consolidation sector . term use cash , think priority still returning cash shareholder right consistent basis last year ? think room , right , looking inorganic opportunity also nvidia ? n't need ? - colette m. kress q - vivek arya - colette m. kress first focus cash really clear need business need term growth . 's lot people looked say , `` wow , investment changed last couple year . '' 'm like , '' , actually , 're always investing . '' take serious pride investing correctly eﬃcient manner . probably different super large company think , need spend ? right place ? right place move forward ? invest . we've invested overall ecosystem also term headcount think need engineering focus term sale marketing extract market going . 's going , first place think overall cash . mean , though , case , might easier invest bulk buy small team , invest small team . 're interested term major consolidation , big business , big business , catalog , catalog merging together . n't think see something would help u manner . think full vertical integration 're could bolt , sure , we'd absolutely look make investment appropriate . last thing 're going finish say , `` excess ? excess would better used term shareholder ? '' yes . we'll return . 's think term look . 's opposite need feed . 's , yes , want make sure we're investing appropriately business . , end time , thanks , everyone , joining u . thank , colette . really appreciate . thank .
