's see rapid sort adoption individual level , see organization adopting broadly standardizing . still early customer example large company built interesting apps powerapps custom apps ? absolutely , -- besides heathrow security guard , got promotion . kasthuri gopalan rangan alysa taylor kasthuri gopalan rangan alysa taylor kasthuri gopalan rangan alysa tayloryes , , 's great story . video make teary-eyed . -- chevron . chevron great example -- started -- oil rig looking 're modernizing app platform . fascinating thing chevron talking 're oil rig switching application , ui consistency incredibly important . actually -- broadly adopting , 're modernizing hundred apps powerapps , standardizing reason modern app platform consistent ui . minimize security risk servicing oil rig . got . got . white space powerapps , see opportunity exist way others exploited ? 've already answered question , anything else would like add respect -- well , app development -- like look pure tam perspective , like 's large tam . always set application -- enterprise application . 's ongoing investment area organization . think large addressable market 's unique concept we've talked able end-user adoption corporate standardization level , think powerapps big growth area u . excellent , excellent . switching flow . flow ? , talk power platform talked 's automate component , flow modern automation platform . hundred connector allow connect different desperate data source automate different task . flow , like rpa obviously another kind hot term industry right . process automation , flow allows thing talked powerapps easy way automation across business function , type concept , easy statement , rapid adoption ﬂow well . particularly oﬃce user 've seen high flow adoption within oﬃce user . flow work powerapps obviously , build custom application ? kasthuri gopalan rangan alysa taylor q - kasthuri gopalan rangan q - unidentified participantyes , 's embedded powerapps , yes . , -- within business entity , like automate 's hundred connector important , connect different data . consumer space well . late whole area workﬂow broadly speaking flow , way describe gotten quite bit attention . 's another company servicenow talked workﬂow automation big opportunity . microsoft 's strength approaching workﬂow market ? two company spoken . much excitement ? well , think -- look matter organization , many task , particularly get industry like manufacturing , 's much opportunity like job task analysis , able automate , 're manual today 're costly they're higher , 're error prone . able automate something company looking -- way ? would say servicenow microsoft big player talking . 's bunch emerging company , ( inaudible ) rpa space . automation anywhere , 's quite emerging space able take task repeatable automate . think flow particular , say , 'll hear u talk lot , 's unique thing think bring bear flow , one predetermined connector . connect across data source on-prem well cloud . ability oﬃce integration . think task perspective , front-line worker typically type oﬃce application 're using . able automate back-end front-end something 's unique bring bear automation space workﬂow space . question answer far think lot u impression 's statement question servicenow one talking , 've got microsoft talking workﬂow automation , 's going truly exciting . want make quick pause check see get bi , 's question presenter ? question , shankar , yeah go ahead . ( inaudible ) - alysa taylor q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - alysa taylor q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - alysa taylor q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - alysa taylorabsolutely , 's great question . flow , obviously , great asset within dynamic able automate different workﬂow task , flow , saying , adoption within flow actually highest within oﬃce space . use flow across data set asset . go-to-market standalone offering . actually -- reason 're sort coming broadly flow -- 're changing business model around flow , widely adaptable broadly available corporation standalone offer . brilliant . moving power bi . look like hear lot power bi day . -- product unique ? well , 's family . talk power platform , theme power platform self serve , right ? ability self-service case , analytics . power bi -- akin powerapps term adoption pattern . see analyst using power bi , graduating beyond excel function able analytics way low code , code type environment , self-service bi . power bi effectively built azure data lake ingest kind -- different type data able self -- bi self analyzation corporate level well . 's see , 's common theme powerapps power bi , enabling self- service individual level sort corporate function well . bi , general , really matured category power bi we've brought -- actually released able bring cognitive service , text recognition , new ai capability , direct import export azure data lake . really enterprise-grade feature come self- serve bi function . n't feel like 's replacement cycle replacement cycle traditional bi landscape something replacement cycle ? well 's -- think see right -- come -- using bi analyze particular function department , see adoption grows throughout organization , actually see replacement cycle come legacy bi . 're seeing replacement happen right old 15-year-old technology year-old technology ? q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - alysa taylor q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - alysa taylor q - kasthuri gopalan ranganyes , yes see . interesting , another customer story . ceo air new zealand , actually said like , gone process putting rfp modernizing legacy bi system , like , would multi-year going evaluation like told analyst team going power bi , pervasive within leadership team within analyst community . see groundswell 's inﬂuencing modernization cycle upgrade legacy cycle . excellent , excellent . look whole bi space , analytics technology exactly far future potential fundamental analytics technology ? anything could point ? well , think touched little bit , 's kind -- like think cognitive service within analytics 's exciting space . yes , tell u . cognitive service ? think facial recognition speech recognition , able -- within power bi , analyze like 've talked , cognitive -- need inside sale able analyze understand call pattern tell -- 're inside tell -- ( inaudible ) vendor , like able bring sort speech recognition able analyze pattern . thing think 've seen -- particularly within power bi unique area able actually trend within within power bi . get alert every day say certain dashboard new data new function analyzed get report actually tell across dashboard changed . actually see analytics within analytics , get exciting . thing 'll hear u deeper -- able deeper embedded analytics . go bi application , actually take advantage rich analytics capability thing like powerpoint , excel , continuing build application people use everyday , self-served bi embedded . 's exciting space analytics . google talked , came talking integration google sheet . see move going people every single day able analytics versus pulling day-to- day application . got . also competition aspect analytics technology . want analytics company run azure cloud . see - alysa taylor q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - alysa taylor q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - alysa taylorpartnership wanting bi company running cloud versus wanting bi powerhouse ? well , think 's world -- business application space , think definition cooperation competition . sap running -- sap , adobe . thing anyone audience heard , announced something called open data initiative last fall . thing like 's across adobe , microsoft sap . reason came together even though -- competition app layer three company , 're committed able open data standard , actually data common data layer , shared freely across application . think bringing together data , enriching ﬂowing back app layer . center notion application free data house , lot -- that's come partnership across ecosystem . 's pursuit freeing customer data , get data . historically , 've seen bi landscape evolve application company , somewhat late game , end getting , saw -- cognos , hyperion , business object , probably half dozen analytics , pure standalone company ultimately erp company started build , good specialist , ended good enough , ended acquiring pure-play bi company . -- see playing cycle ? something different make standalone analytics technology viable long run ? think system record , guess -- dynamic business bi business . brought thought space evolves . going domain company business data , erp system , pure bi company , end viable best ( inaudible ) still thriving business , without erp hcm crm system . actually think slightly differently , think -- 'll see salesforce announced mulesoft , see actually work sap well . race think app layer , actually race data layer . aggregate data , whether erp system crm system name , know , q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - alysa taylor q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - alysa taylor q - kasthuri gopalan rangan q - unidentified participant q - kasthuri gopalan rangan q - unidentified participant - alysa tayloron-prem legacy system , data able analyze , automate , build new application . think actually future , pure-play bi versus good enough . see interesting thing space right used historically definition bi , erp , crm , pure play , see every single one expanding , knowing ca n't one function . 's cross pollinate able maximize data use new way reason data garner intelligence . world exists today etl , 's expensive , 's time-consuming , 's latency , there's natural gravitational pull like take business data . etl never sounded good get go . yeah , , ( multiple speaker ) yeah exactly , , 's one ever define -- excruciation , torture . expensive . think , , -- think race right kind app layer . anybody question ? might actually call minute early , -- yeah , please . get mic -- yeah . think might end finishing question time mic -- - yeah . ( inaudible ) . want rephrase question , ? flow area business , go-to-market , usually come ? work go new customer win business ? q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - alysa taylor q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - alysa taylorso akash talked . servicenow probably largest workﬂow automation space . rpa space , find uipath . automation anywhere well like emerging player industry specific like [ ph ] drishti . 's really sort process automation thing like perception analytics able image recognition . think servicenow probably -- actually pegasus . 've sort redefined kind rpa category digital dpm category . pegasus servicenow probably two biggest . flow u , talked , largely ceded-free product . evolving business model come . talk rfp , 're -- right high-adoption curve flow , 's standalone business 're monetizing yet . question . david good see , old gang . old gang new question . alright . good see guy . well , n't question . want make special mention , topic woman executive leadership prominence , particularly technology industry something pay close attention .
