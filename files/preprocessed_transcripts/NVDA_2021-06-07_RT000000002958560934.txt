thank much cj hosting u . turn manuvir , wanted quickly cover forward-looking statement . reminder , presentation contains forward-looking statement , investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business . okay , , 'll turn manuvir . yeah , thank much cj simona . thought would cj outset talk little bit background 're 're , right ? referenced work 're enterprise customer talked computex think really start question jensen ceo taught last month coming democratization ai really mean , today work 've done last decade , thousand company around globe using artificial intelligence nvidia technology talk democratization ai 're talking ten thousand thousand company using ai , 's mean democratization think conversation really begin ? believe company actually going adopt ai , would like share point view slide . 's three reason think every company use ai . i'll focus couple . first , democratize technology across wide base enterprise customer , really customer use technology directly aware implementing technology . whereas today 's customer aware ai 're putting infrastructure , hardware software take ai , data scientist , develop thing ai democratized , every company using application use , built ai . great example microsoft oï¬ƒce , infused ai . work nvidia 's cloudera , data analytics platform infused technology user , actually difference experience . 's 's special hardware underneath every server , software updated . see big shift coming every application infused ai make intelligent , customer 's experience average customer company 's application used . 's one aspect . second aspect want highlight right hand side picture , ai every product think today , early adopter ai would really internet company , people large online presence , thing like example , recommend next book read , next movie watch , next product buy , big social audience , i'm interacting , see company built product regular product , ai infused life cycle product design product , manufacture product , engage customer , learn engagement improve product next cycle . 's another democratization opportunity every company regardless , would utilizing ai . shift already see underway really work 're hardware software prime entire ecosystem top bottom participate democratization , every company benefit . , couple slide lay work 've enable . picture represents full platform , nvidia full-stack computing company . today much internally software company hardware company , many engineer working software hardware , reason use artificial intelligence , use variety different use case , whether 's video analysis , conversational ai , cyber security , robotics , need powerful software stack situation enable capability application developer complete solution . q - c.j . museso look stack , start bottom server , mainstream server , volume server , server produced oems world today racked enterprise data center every day , little bit gpu nvidia every server . layer top , vmware vsphere , vmware de facto operating system enterprise computing . 's got large footprint 've taken essential software 've built year , framework , toolkits , sdks , almost operating system ai 've packaged together something called nvidia ai enterprise , enterprise customer use like platform deployed to-date framework 've built different ai use case , , complete computing stack hardware software , making much turnkey experience enterprise customer . shift model , whereas working closely oems best-of-breed server ai -- bespoke server , one thing , ai , 're relatively -- much higher price point hardware inside motion 're talking democratization ee worked oem 's really come mainstream server said , go next slide , excited , 've taken technology really rightsized mainstream . 've made smaller gpus , power-eï¬ƒcient gpus , cost -- lower cost gpus cpu bluefield work oems produce system server recently announced whole wave new system new vendor . 'm proud say , 103 different server workstation configuration 16 different manufacturer number keep going . really cj , backdrop conversation , 've sort phase last decade 've developed hardware software ai . 've got traction -- business well , thousand customer using technology , 're really shifting democratization becomes ten thousand hundred thousand customer . question answer ( question answer ) well , 's great start . thank . guess interestingly talked nvidia becoming software company , particularly bringing ai mass . going say actually start . jen , announced number partnership platform whether 's vmware , omniverse newly announced base command ai software development platform . think lot underappreciated market , guess let 's take little bit deeper . let's start vmware vmware partnership ai enterprise software suite . think percentage socket would benefit - manuvir da q - c.j . muse - manuvir da q - c.j . musewilling take advantage type enterprise license think tam expansion nvidia 's enterprise hardware business ? yeah , think 's great question start cj . , first point would make clearly , 's tam expansion nvidia new business 're entering monetize software enterprise customer , right ? think opportunity large think company estate data center admins managing vmware environment sharing resource across application user , 'll opportunity farm ai resource application in-house data scientist . 's r & side production side ai . 's large opportunity look simple math 's 8 million enterprise server cpu year pricing model nvidia ai enterprise software $ 3,600 per socket perpetual license 's additional 25 % annual maintenance . vsphere attached 300,000 customer . 's billion dollar opportunity time 're really looking forward opening market first time nvidia . really helpful guess , could also speak enablement deployment ai application suite . yeah . think way think cj really , 's three layer stack , deliver technology like ai . first layer people associate nvidia , opportunity tradition hardware , right , chip system talked second layer , nvidia ai enterprise , operating system ai , 's essential thing need platform ai , described . third opportunity , third layer application top , nvidia invested heavily year , whether 's clara healthcare , metropolis video analysis edge , certainly think significant opportunity well go forward time , -- see u opening opportunity 's interesting level cj application , drive opportunity , application . example , highly trained highly paid doctor spend le time analyzing x-ray application software helping get started 's one kind value , right ? processing something store 'm able control amount material good inadvertently taken store 's different kind financial calculation customer , right ? , think application layer , one time , 's really based value provided customer term application . guess -- little bit deeper application layer . license opportunity well guess perhaps bigger picture , think - manuvir da q - c.j . muse - manuvir dasyour business entirely better price time percentage revenue think become recurring ? yeah , think absolutely licensing opportunity 's meant talked value , right licensing opportunity application different 's dependent value provided customer complicated problem solving behalf , right ? definitely anticipate . think far question -- look opportunity compared hardware . think , certainly time , expect software opportunity least large hardware opportunity . hardware opportunity already enterprise believe well $ 10 billion 've talked . see software opportunity certainly getting getting , time , think -- look layer stack hardware middle operating system via application , value increase go stack . really see shift changing towards software go . also asked recurring , certainly 's attractive model today customer well software vendor , intend fully participate model go forward . helpful . , omniverse , seems strong presence many nvidia 's recent presentation . make excited platform think opportunity next year company guess , either term revenue , user growth whatever metric think worthwhile discussing ? yeah , think reason optimistic omniverse cj , reaction 've seen . omniverse basically platform collaboration , collaborative design . began know nvidia company lot design work , 3d work remote team especially covid-19 , necessary work remote fashion . saw opportunity built software platform built started working early customer , saw really quite high interest . example , already today , 're launching platform 400 company already evaluating platform u company like bmw , erickson , bentley , best known company world excited working u like engineer excited platform , right ? 's one reason see realize problem problem began solve actually universal problem , company work collaboratively , 's lot design work , matter kind company . reason 're optimistic market analysis , realized 20 million designer engineer world today benefit platform like work collaboratively , work q - c.j . muse - manuvir dasunder house part team produce different part solution plugged together , right licensing model omniverse . 've announced already announced computex typical company , starting point $ 14,000 per year company get started designer , math number designer engineer , think benefit technology licensing model think really significant opportunity . guess , perhaps moving recent announcement involving netapp base command software development platform . seems like important driver create subscription model dgx superpod guess , could maybe highlight think opportunity nvidia . , make offering unique versus something like using gpu service cloud player . yes , 'm glad brought cj , important -- strategically important initiative nvidia 'm glad lay -- first thing understand strong partnership cloud vendor vendor . happy work . done great work making gpu based technology available wide base customer . 's thriving model , continue thrive think many , many customer place ai work 're happy support csps ask . said , definitely see need customer base complement solution hybrid private cloud reason data gravity . ai based taking data putting use every customer , requirement data need preside quite different , data diï¬ƒcult move . ai computation capability need customer data 's large section customer whose data public cloud public cloud , public cloud . 're covering opportunity behalf customer base . 's first thing understand . second thing 's actually two thing going . first , ai certainly outside diï¬ƒcult technology operationalize , nvidia one largest consumer ai planet , work self-driving car robotics year , built internally software platform called base command data scientist use every day ai work , utilize equipment well possibly every time work customer talk superpod provide equipment , give little tour , show glimpse 've got inside in-house base command question always get customer get took u little productize get ready customer made available , 's first thing . base command platform q - c.j . muse - manuvir da q - c.j . muse - manuvir dasthis software use internally year 're making available customer actually operate equipment , like , dgx superpod provide , even operate infrastructure public cloud announced partnership public cloud provider . second part cj , hardware base command platform going help operate really taken small step , big move nvidia said , okay , first time , take equipment 've got superpod , ï¬‚agship product , instrument ai provide subscription model nvidia take risk owning equipment . nvidia operate equipment behalf , consume consume month time 's like 's new endeavor nvidia . 're excited think really lower barrier entry customer . many customer experience superpod , either move procure scale cloud different people cloud today . dgx superpod unique capability . 's instrument ai , 's combination hardware , software , tuning package really allow best- of-breed ai right network everything built-in , 's unique capability 's provided customer fashion experience . interesting . , clear . 're going operate effectively mini data center enterprise customer , site enterprise player . okay . , 's hosted offering c.j . certainly referrenced netapp partnership netapp storage provider infrastructure , 're also working equinix , well know , large provider co-location space service across globe . fact , lot csps hosted equinix . environment 're providing hosted within equinix data center . 're company's individual data centre . got . well , guess one last question front , guess think workload cloud versus on-prem kind new partnership netapp equinix , looking five year part , respond question received , think 's concern ai service hosted cloud player kind minimize amount gpu 's accelerator one might need . know would address well part question ? q - c.j . muse - manuvir dasyeah , 's great question 's two-part answer c.j . firstly asked anticipate mix , ai workload run cloud versus on- premise . think 's important understand talk on- premise non-cloud , huge part going forward edge , lot company work today . whether 're retail store factory industrial company certainly , 're edge , right , 're competition cloud lot ai happen edge , data coming right real time , data analyzed processed right outcome happen right , right ? certainly , edge big dominant force ai deployed . secondly enterprise customer , data center versus cloud , 's matter data gravity . think many industry , healthcare great example company large amount data certainly , 's beneficial hold data in-house . data really ip , 's computation need live data cj , see every cloud provider also working non-cloud solution , right , move capability outside public cloud , 's reason , right data gravity going dominant factor going forward . one part . second question regarding concern raised , 's going ai service cloud provider , mean nvidia ? 's reason thousand thousand engineer best engineer planet working every day hardware software , platform , believe best differentiated full-stack platform ai . cloud partner provide ai service cloud today use hardware software quite bit providing service 's great thing fully anticipate ai service cloud continue develop progress footprint using nvidia hardware software technology today work closely . joined engineer cater requirement get customer . 're confident customer adopt public cloud ai service , nvidia front center journey cloud provider customer . , course , 's complimentary world working like netapp equinix others on-premises edge . helpful . perhaps move hardware side house , quarter 100 introduction enterprise world . speak reception anything jump noteworthy worthy discussion ? yeah , think demand strong cj . first thing oems built qualified system a100 , moved fast know server company go qualification cycle , 's physic involved , saw opportunity u , really turned dime , thankful quickly reacted see effect q - c.j . muse - manuvir dasthe market . also csp partner adopted a100 quickly , uptake amazing . fact , see , wrong demand public cloud a100 instance cloud provider . think 's great . term area , 've seen strong adoption consumer internet , financial service , higher education . overall , pleased cj uptake expected outset . pleased . yes . think intelligent edge nvidia 's opportunity dgx platform speak work company done foster adoption specifically ease move ai edge ? yeah , think c.j 's really good point make ai really ecosystem effort ca n't build chip say , okay , 's great chip , everybody ai , 's million use case . , need ecosystem isvs produce right application , right especially true edge every company trying something completely different edge . maybe , 'm retail store 'm looking people picking stuff counter , oil gas facility -- perimeter security . use case completely different right factory robotics many , many year ago , nvidia , decided take platform approach . put programming model top gpu call cuda , 's today 2.5 million developer ecosystem build cuda . philosophy chose opposed saying built dedicated chip every particular use case like kind pga , kind approach , platform approach really paying come intelligent edge , one platform nvidia , every isv work within ecosystem quickly develop application tailor-made particular use case they're one . maybe 'm working walmart , particular suite -- solution retail store , 'm working bmw thing 're putting factory ï¬‚oor , 's chip , 's sdk , 's framework library rely add ip top provide solution customer , right ? think really strong winning formula approach intelligent edge . , egx hardware platform every oem producing ruggedized purpose-built form factor go edge closet somewhere place 's hard , 's cold 've got whole software stack -- isvs depend final piece puzzle cj , built platform called ï¬‚eet command . talked base command earlier , data scientist use develop ai , ï¬‚eet command platform used deploy ai edge , think retailer example , work walmart , right think many store walmart around world putting little bit equipment edge every store every store traditional , people sitting every store , walking q - c.j . muse - manuvir dasdown watching equipment , 's two three server every store . really need , need kind command module centralized manages system every store keep ai up-to- date make sure nothing 's tampered , 's secure , ï¬‚eet command , right ? would say short summary , think nvidia massive opportunity intelligent edge , bet right platform , universal platform , built ecosystem around , put tooling around ï¬‚eet command , really help people operationalize . helpful . five minute left right . got seven page question , 'll try put couple together . kind product show mellanox acquisition . also three chip strategy bringing arm-based cpu . , guess perhaps look next three five year , get excited term hardware capability able bring bear guess full pre-chip solution , really move needle enterprise ? yeah , think 's great way wrap c.j . really two front , one data processing unit dpu , technology mellanox brought nvidia , cpu announced -- cpu based arm . 're actually way diametrically opposite 's important understand . reason excited dpu nvidia believe going forward , every server shipped one dpus . universal opportunity . kind opportunity mathematics would , take number server shipped put dpu every server reason security -- stake data center security becoming harder harder sheer volume traï¬ƒc , amount data dpu actually enables security solution actually stand test time every data center . believe dpu every server . reason today server getting bogged cpu used lot sort data center processing surround application 's taking away oxygen application need server run application actually , access full cpu dpu oï¬ „ oads work cpu , give another place run , cpu fully free run application , right . see model going forward every server cpu , 'll gpus run application suitable gpus , 'll always dpu essential component 're , excited opportunity cj think work 're , 've laying groundwork oems , vmware , cloud provider trigger movement dpu every server . q - c.j . muse - manuvir da q - c.j . musenow cpu work much contrast . reason working grace specific situation , ai extreme high scale model , large . example , getting model natural language processing ten billion parameter , soon 'll trillion parameter , large model try process model , matter many server , communication cpu gpu becomes big bottleneck , 've got engine called gpu , process large-scale ai , come cpu designed grace carefully cpu tightly integrated gpu alongside system 'm saying help convey niche solution particular use case high scale ai . believe foreseeable future , majority enterprise workload running x86 cpu work closely large system x86 based server system anticipate long time , think going dominant part business time come , we've developed grace really expand frontier , right move needle best-of-breed -- look like . , dpu every server big , small , regardless workload , got dpu -- grace exactly opposite . small number workload , 's going difference able , everything else , x86 cpu would awesome . great . one last question , 'll sneak . , focus beginning democratizing ai . learned call software opportunity going least large hardware opportunity presentation earlier today another company talked next three five year , least third workload done compute using ai would seem create strong path growth . got 30 second , want close kind framework ? yeah . think , 'll close saying , already good point , think data center business today , already case half data center business enterprise business company within building , deploying ai technology spite nascent area complexity come adopting new technology think 're beautiful point , learned much customer adopted ai , two thing clear u . one every company benefit ai two , platform make possible right moment start journey democratizing ai , working ecosystem c.j make happen , 's 're happy partnership , something done alone done conjunction trusted vendor enterprise customer already work , coming enterprise customer solution easy use , comfortable providing new capability . - jensen huang q - c.j . museexcellent . well , thank time , greatly appreciated , wish best luck . thank much nvidia . well .
