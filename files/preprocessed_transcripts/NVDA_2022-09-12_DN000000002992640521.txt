's we're focusing energy finding eﬃciencies behind scene best . okay . got . 'm hopping around little bit . wanted hit automotive . 's robust design win funnel . think july quarter first quarter 're really solving inﬂection upside , great . talk visibility funnel , sitting p & l think historically , profitability automotive gross margin standpoint , little bit corporate average . see evolving next couple year ? yeah . let give background automotive business . started grow q1 , moving q2 expect going q3 . what's behind ? earlier year , orin architecture launched . nearly 40 design win orin , ranging passenger car , robotaxis future ai vehicle . case anything level two-level two plus level five orin 'll see continue scale time . think 're refer inﬂection point automotive business . early part orin platform get ai software , still company average . software , quite solid gross margin move forward . work broad . pipeline help u visibility . mean , automotive working term manufacturing line . q - toshiya hari - colette kress q - toshiya hari - colette kress q - toshiya hari - colette kresshow many quarter want build . sometimes even give u longer view help u visibility , also tracking term revenue . got . question audience ? colette , guess last couple minute , want give opportunity kind speak aspect business , macro dynamic aware . obviously , nvidia well covered stock , topic hitting . okay . sure . let 's see . nvidia , position right market , demonstrating availability ai , could n't stronger 're approaching really great product cycle , product cycle take graphic architecture , take work data center , bringing compute market new product , also networking business . product cycle important u . important u continue fuel ai market , expansion graphic well , 's going front center . macro economic time , inventory correction , fun thing , also know pas time hopefully end q4 , great position well mobile sell-in sell-through perspective going forward . great new product coming . could n't stronger leadership position take u far , think going forward . maybe lastly capital allocation , thought ? yeah . capital allocation , would always love look & opportunity , quite selective finding right one . felt mellanox great addition , culturally brought u product , continue look . 's easy find . meantime , going focus term stock repurchase rebuying . 've done $ 5 billion first half 've got $ 12 billion opportunity would take u way end next year 's calendar year repurchasing speak . awesome . note , 'd like close session . thank much coming . thank . q - toshiya hari thank , .
