good morning welcome bloomberg intelligence webinar qualcomm-apple regulator litigation drama . name anand srinivasan senior semiconductor hardware analyst bloomberg intelligence . webinar today jen rie , senior antitrust analyst matt larson , intellectual property analyst . also answer question fixed income analyst , y.c . koh . get presentation , housekeeping note ; today 's presentation recorded available playback . bottom slide window , notice adjust volume maximize screen . feel free ask question submitting one right slide . would address q & conclusion presentation . copy slide available download post presentation via email . let 's quickly touch qualcomm primary . research , excuse , research available bloomberg terminal typing bi go . specific company related work accessed typing name ticker , equity bico go . obviously qualcomm , near-term business trend overshadowed antitrust regulatory action u , europe asia . licensing issue particularly intense scrutiny , business model perspective well royalty rate . right stand china specific handset maker 80 % royalty compliance 're shooting towards 100 % compliance course next several quarter . legal issue however distracting industry trend could affect chipset sale well royalty . separately apple , samsung huawei trying insource much semiconductor possible . 's also losing share mediatek intel . whole point nxp transaction diversify away handset-related sale . auto sale nxp heavy intended -- support trend . apple samsung combined make roughly 40 % qualcomm sale , include huawei , contract manufacturer , trying offset auto content shipment growth . jennifer rieif look specific apple litigation well regulatory agency litigation , number one , key point , going take year . apple perspective , apple-qualcomm litigation perspective , well regulatory agency focus , 's going resolved anytime soon . might lot rhetoric side , 's important long view . key risk apple litigation 's specifically potential loss licensing fee apple , precedent said would set across device maker pay qualcomm royalty . particular scenario highest risk scenario , would substantially pressure qualcomm . apple , intel , ieee , everybody else industry skeptical qualcomm 's device based royalty , crux model . antitrust side , pressure qualcomm persist across three continent . subject fine . look global antitrust situation , three specific category break . u lawsuit , encompasses ftc well private class action , pending non-us investigation korea , eu possibly taiwan , nxpi deal merger review u side cleared , ftc lawsuit would impeded , pending eu clearance pending china clearance . , grand list item want discus today . established sort context around stuff want discus today , want turn jen rie second , 've gotten question thousand time , given litigation review across different regulator , break nxpi deal . well , thank anand . well , 've seen already u n't , announced clearance expiration u hsr waiting period , 11:59 last night . 's really good news . mean ftc 's pending lawsuit qualcomm n't really interfere assessment overlap qualcomm nxpi , felt -- nothing problematic able clear even without in-depth investigation , 's good news . , european side , would expect similar u . regulator -- 's actually uncommon regulator investigating company one set conduct , time evaluating merger company pending another entity . 're supposed keep independent , 're different issue , 're different analysis good . keep thing independent . , n't mean eu could n't consider qualcomm conduct 're looking investigation 're quite possibly crash remedy nxpi deal , general , n't see eu 's investigation qualcomm conduct affecting -- ultimately affecting blocking deal affecting outcome deal . anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasan , outcome , potential outcome eu side result conduct , give u brief sense could happen potential path perspective ? sure . , eu investigating actually quite long time qualcomm . investigation little bit different 've seen regulator . 's way license patent considered standard essential patent , whether 're fair reasonable way . eu looking whether certain rebate exclusive yielding deal pricing could cost , alleging 's cost pushing competitor , particular , 're concerned one competitor icera . saying qualcomm offering large rebate low -- ultimately low cost , factor rebate buy exclusively chipsets qualcomm competitor , 's basically pushing icera market , could ultimately hurt market hurt consumer long run . 's different icp outcome . think 's likely fine 's going levy . saw really similar matter intel , saw fine levied $ 1 billion , time biggest eu fine unilateral monopolistic non- cartel type conduct . look -- ﬂip one page deck , look -- colleague europe , aitor ortiz , put together really nice comparison chart showing way , way intel fine calculated comparing qualcomm . see global revenue intel fine based $ 30 billion time qualcomm revenue estimated $ 21 billion fine would ultimately based . five plus year conduct intel , four year qualcomm , suggests lower fine . , see fine $ 1 billion , right , 've got lesser period time lesser revenue intel fine . think fine likely . two statement objection eu seem pretty dug conduct . said , right , anand , looking long-term , qualcomm tend fight thing , lot success fight antitrust action . likely fight keep fighting , could continue drag . jennifer rie anand srinivasan matt larsonso nothing , resolution near term , timeline perspective , n't look regulatory action u , china taiwan , korea , impediment closure nxpi deal ? absolutely . 's right . expect deal likely get cleared within timeline kind set , said end 2017 need formalize filing china eu still get time clock started , still plenty time passed one big hurdle yesterday getting u clearance think 's likely able get affected regulatory review . yeah . point , 16 % share tendered yesterday , 17 % last disclosed , jen pointed , time clock n't even started europe china . 've got long way go deal closure , ahead regulatory clearance required . matt larson , intellectual property analyst , let 's talk apple . give u context qualcomm-apple case ? could dive detail , sep , industry standard practice , everybody problem qualcomm 's royalty ( inaudible ) different standard industry practice ? yeah , sure . thanks , anand . 's bunch question one , 'll parse little bit . essentially boil , think qualcomm , 's two component : chip sale patent licensing le . we're focused patent licensing . large portion qualcomm 's patent licensing revenue driven so-called standard essential patent . kind quick primer standard essential patent sep , patent cover technology incorporated industry interoperability standard . standard -- industry group get together , representative involved company sit kind agree tech going , either fix current generation technology future generation . , group like 3rd generation partnership project , 3gpp , sc , ieee , group people get together promulgate standard . part standard setting process , company offer technology , get incorporated tech everybody going use , technology covered patent . , part participating group , company agree license patent participant people use interoperability standard so-called frand term . frand acronym fair reasonable non- anand srinivasandiscriminatory . basically mean everybody agrees license patent effectively roughly relatively low rate , idea want promote use standard time want compensate people who've done r & order build standard . circling back round dispute qualcomm sits , qualcomm actively engaged standard setting , particularly dispute apple focusing 3g/umts standard us wcdma , focus 4g lte . also serf little bit preview 's going go 5g developed , 5g start get rolled various country next three four year . everybody focused frand rate issue , fair , reasonable non- discriminatory ? appropriate rate ? appropriate royalty base ? 's percentage maybe percentage apply royalty handset . asking price ? percentage asking price ? party differ way 's done . company move little bit ﬂat fee arrangement , company like ericsson recently announced preliminary rate 5g . dispute deal one company frand term start affect everybody else license patent frand term . 's kind high-level overview , sep background dispute arising . qualcomm 's issue little bit different standard patent license think ericsson huawei tech pure play primarily r & focus patent , much combination chipset business . , company like samsung certainly chipset business , they're also involved handset , motivation protecting margin balancing license sep slightly different qualcomm whose chip licensing sep -- whose chip sale licensing sep go hand- in-hand . also distinction way qualcomm apple licensed past . qualcomm currently licensed patent oems company put together iphone , whereas apple past entered much direct licensing agreement , recently ericsson , directly interdigital previously licensed pegatron . , apple kind chair direct licensing agreement try get better deal sep , dispute boiled lawsuit apple qualcomm directly . got . 's important note , u covered qualcomm extensively past , 've seen , one thing remember often actually decided bunch lawyer trying interpret potential technical spec particular design see right way may therefore eligible enforcing royalty . roughly right , matt larson anand srinivasanqualcomm 's royalty rate weighted average handset basis device license 2.3 % . 's important note difference qualcomm others , qualcomm -- qualcomm 's royalty fee based cap price course , based price device , rather price chip within device performs function . part major sort acrimonious issue industry participant . 's also important note apple currently licensee qualcomm , hon hai , general contract manufacture pas charge apple . hon hai also make handset besides iphone , hon hai one paying qualcomm royalty , pay based price via iphone apple , roughly 45 % handset asp retail customer assuming apple roughly 55 % gross margin . one interpret another licensing drama , matt larson , coming back , one -- one special ? cooperation agreement , perhaps go -- -- n't another grand licensing dispute drag [ ph ] . think 's -- think 's great way , great way visualizing . view dispute apple qualcomm lawsuit -- core patent licensing litigation . antitrust concern unique qualcomm , think international investigation various finding korea , taiwan , pending investigation japan , ndrc settlement set rate royalty basis phone maker china . , apple lot leverage dispute , plus way frame qualcomm 's licensing le strong arming people providing strong incentive buy qualcomm chip rather add qualcomm royalty rate whatever chip buy third party . , apple kind putting whole issue lawsuit effect attempt negotiate better deal . think way -- way play way party -- least talked resolving last couple year kind direct licensing agreement . order get , apple kind dredging lot legal issue surrounding qualcomm 's business use leverage lawsuit . ( multiple speaker ) frank , -- ( multiple speaker ) back envelope matt came low two 's weighted average handset , royalty hon hai pay qualcomm . 's -- precedent respect rate , 's -- acceptable royalty rate sort scenario ? zero best rate apple going forward ? precedent would helpful . matt larson anand srinivasan matt larson yeah . couple decision take look . anand mentioned earlier , diﬃcult , lot royalty rate set close door negotiation . frequently n't see light day , people community kind know roughly everyone -- everyone paying core maybe five company negotiating one another . le know -- offer pressure point system . dispute boiled court decision get kind rationale , court go least lawyer view patent licensing . 're seeing rate certainly sub 3 % asp . look ndrc settlement qualcomm 's patent licensing practice handset china based 65 % net selling price rate worth 5 % 3g , 3.5 % 4g . ericsson recently disclosed asking rate ongoing lawsuit tcl . tcl ericsson engaged licensing discussion boiled litigation past couple year recently went trial asking judge set appropriate frand rate global license ericsson tcl . license older generation technology , 2g kind sub 1 % , get -- come 4g , 4g lte license around , 're approaching 2 % cap . look like $ 4 cap , kind adjusting handset complicated move 5g , they're going interconnected , interconnected car , wireless device longer limited handset licensing practice starting recognize . get 5 % catalog 's wi-fi enabled router 's got kind cellular functionality . cap based value functionality device . 's lot ( multiple speaker ) . actually , know specific ratio qualcomm actually clarified charge royalty based -- automobile based value module go , enables specific function , -- exactly , argument come line case talk 's appropriate royalty base dispute language interpreted . language royalty . appropriate royalty smallest salable unit . , apple commonly interprets , well smallest salable unit chip . royalty based chip , whereas practice fc among company , know , royalty base handset , 's tiny chip , 's larger value . 's little bit legal anand srinivasan matt larson anand srinivasan jennifer rietheme 's playing , apple trying minimize royalty qualcomm obviously trying get larger piece pie calculate compensation . , happens ? next step ? lay sort potential sequence timeline roughly ? yeah , sure . apple filed complaint look like qualcomm file essentially motion dismiss challenging necessarily ultimate conclusion come lawsuit , preliminary motion winnow apple 's complaint . 's lot incendiary language , everything see legal pleading taken grain salt , lawyer working hard present best case possibly , may look lot damning actually reality . qualcomm file response apple 's complaint april 10th . 'll likely see lot criticism . 'll try poke hole apple 's complaint . briefing back forth summer , date n't set , judge likely hear preliminary dispute scope case august could see case really starting kind mid-3q . note , case take long time resolve . patent case , average patent case take 2.5 year district california . looking potential resolution would end 2018 earliest party able dispose issue trial , likely 2019 , according court 's schedule . 's absent kind out-of-court settlement party able reach . point look like 're fairly far apart 're viewing licensing agreement , yet noting agreement going huge impact end 4g 5g license structured . got . n't hold breath point . jen , across -- yeah , across antitrust , long going take much going cost ? well , timing , matt said , sometimes antitrust lawsuit generally take long time resolve . federal trade commission lawsuit qualcomm , sort related -- issue related apple lawsuit matt talked . 's related way qualcomm licensed standard essential patent , 2007 agreement apple . lawsuit -- controversy around lawsuit right timing , 's ftc lawsuit , commissioner vote bring suit anand srinivasanthe time voted , three commissioner , two one vote , need majority vote bring suit . one left two commissioner left , one -- one commissioner left quite opposed bringing suit . actually came said seen robust economic evidence supporting fact qualcomm 's conduct caused kind exclusion kind harm market . lot -- speculation two commissioner left one opposed suit acting chairperson , suit could get dropped . , recently last week aba antitrust conference discussed bit . seems several speaker , expert felt would n't happen , suit would n't get dropped would seem political , thing momentum get going n't get dropped , suggest ftc prosecuting suit chairperson backing , could mean n't really actively prosecute . could mean kind lamely go emotion sort state away maybe end easy settlement , mean could quicker sometimes . private suit , copycat ftc suit common , 'll take lot longer . seeking monetary damage , ftc looking money , looking change conduct . private class action plaintiff buyer mobile phone , handheld device , tablet , claim paid inﬂated price higher licensing cost oems passed . 're looking triple damage anything overpaid since believe 2013. , drag long time also suspect qualcomm fight really hard , especially commissioner ohlhausen 's statement harm market due qualcomm's conduct , private plaintiff also show harm market . sustain antitrust case , private plaintiff show harmed , show market harm . ca n't show market harm , 're done . , suspect qualcomm fight , 'll drag ultimately probably settle amount 's unlikely particularly material . timing eu , , 's going drag . could announcement sign next year sooner later . term continuing fight final resolution , 's way road . nxpi merger , like said , qualcomm estimated 'll able close end 2017. think 's really good estimate , especially get filing eu china formalized next month , seem news , imminent . think great chance getting close meeting deadline . got . recap , equity analyst perspective lawyer trade , 34 private case consolidated hearing couple day ago jennifer rie anand srinivasandecision four week . right , let clarify , hearing whether case put one big case . 's hearing front one judge , one court , everybody get put together . happens , case start . 'll file new complaint consolidated group plaintiff slows thing even . hearing took place march 30th . ftc suit -- n't mean interrupt , guess , said , 's quite ahead , ftc suit qualcomm yesterday filed motion dismiss suit . , yesterday good day motion plus u antitrust clearance briefing continue june , mid-june likely argument decision , could get decision end 2017. got , got . parallel process apple complaint , qualcomm 's response date apple complaint matt larson mentioned april 10th , august 2017 preliminary hearing subject whether apple case may proceed . ruling might come mid late 3q . late 2018 early ruling possible , could drag well 2019 final ruling . course 's appeal matt mentioned , average , take 2.5 year trial one complicated . antitrust litigation , , 2019 beyond jen mentioned . know , 've 30 minute . want pause take question field . 'll pause minute get question . one question meanwhile 're polling accumulating question , happens apple n't pay meanwhile . interesting side note , hon hai one license apple , hon hai 's business would imperiled decides pay apple part -- pay qualcomm , excuse , royalty . another question often asked , royalty settlement reached , slide , look -- 've done financial analysis whether apple alone benefited royalty rate qualcomm apple reducing royalty rate little bit hit qualcomm 's fiscal year '18 earnings , material . , precedent question sends , wo n't everyone else wanted . look , substantial , substantial everybody else partake , 's substantial hit royalty model qualcomm . 's earnings power really come fiscal '18 . scenario people worried justifiably . jennifer rie anand srinivasan jennifer riebut 've done past ndrc royalty rate reduced qualcomm fact appeal approach customer saying , hey , deal struck ndrc . deal oems china benefit , 'll partake deal . case non-chinese handset , whether handset made china , question , whether handset go china , used china question . handset , higher royalty rate applicable qualcomm . , global handset oems n't make whole lot sense , chinese handset oems shipping lot product non-china region n't make lot sense . -- able contain fallout may restricted chinese handset maker making product predominantly consumption china market alone . , court finding favor qualcomm mentioned , would disastrous scenario . couple question . soonest nxp deal could get done , could get approval opinion ? think reason 's really hard estimate wildcard chinese approval . part reason china , deal like , tech deal go ministry commerce approves deal antitrust perspective , also go one ministry review technology issue ministry slow ministry commerce allowed clear 've heard technology group . slowed past semiconductor deal . would say probably soonest guess really guess based long took deal get cleared . 'm guessing soonest could nine month announced , announced late october 2016. reason picked number eight nine month look western digital sandisk , look analog device linear technology , intel altera past semi deal last two year , one n't require divestiture , suspect happen took six eight nine month . nxp freescale took longer , europe u divest radio frequency business . think possibly eight nine month let 's say november 1st , 2016. got . remember qualcomm said expectation -- end '17 . anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasan matt larson end '17 . right . end calendar '17 right . , question -- , think end calendar '17 really safe question soonest . 'm saying may -- also depends qualcomm time clock regulator n't start qualcomm formally filed know n't formally filed europe , happens , european union , european commission set public docket look docket , set yet . got . , n't happened . 's possible formally filed china , although sort doubt . think , would said something publicly . got . thank . start seeing whether qualcomm licensee start challenge royalty agreement ? timeline royalty scheme changing qualcomm meet law suit ? want get matt larson , , remember qualcomm individual contract individual timeframes term licensing agreement royalty payment individual company . , samsung deal , apple -- hon hai deal , vivo , oppo , lenovo , separate deal span different term . , unless somebody decides default contract , 's unlikely royalty scheme would change unless material impact litigation perspective . , matt larson , seen interim change result regulatory review -- mean litigation another oem ? anand srinivasanyeah , yeah . 've definitely seen . let answer two part . kind piggybacking response people start renegotiate rate . license typically last anywhere three seven year . , thinking individual license , three seven year skew three five year term typically thing start expire . individual licensee , -- 's explicitly stated , guestimate -- 's thing come 're really negotiating rate probably two year thing expire . , licensee midst renegotiating rate least contemplating think 5g starting discussion already elephant room going apple litigation . agreement n't typically penned n't take effect prior agreement expired . we've seen number different case , sometimes 's litigation party can't agree agreement end , lawsuit filed party run favorable jurisdiction order try get favorable patent ruling . 've seen ericsson case , 've seen nokia , 're starting see couple case filed blu , blackberry lg approaching blu increased sale , trying put pressure different jurisdiction . 's -- 's little bit soft answer , kind answer , based individual license , maybe three five year license signed . generally apple , people use -- use ongoing litigation negotiating point , shoe drop kind determination party exited litigation . , 's really strongest precedent either settlement announced judicial decision judge issue something point say , look , 's legal precedent license body intellectual property . like said , think , earliest end 2018 likely sometime 2019 see -- judge put pen paper come something people use negotiation . got . interesting matt bought timing -- apple potentially action imagination well . look far ahead 5g potential 2020 , 2021 back drive certain amount r & required , integration required , testing required come back current timeline -- apple always action rather word far wanting make chip . see runway want take in-sourcing , move qualcomm , partially intel demonstrates , could prep ahead 5g window . 5g timing 2020 , 2021 , could , interesting . , 's another data point might want consider . -- matt larson anand srinivasanso please -- 's another question . please clarify whether qualcomm negotiating power oems making handset shipped china build sold within china ? look ndrc deal , two-part sort royalty structure . one made china , consumed china -- chinese vendor made china , consumed elsewhere . could la carte menu chinese -- chinese-based technology chinese-based -- technology needed in-country china , plus technology needed region world , add two royalty together come certain block based volume shipment . parallel , could say , okay , global handset licensing structure independent region see one lower would pick one based volume . insofar qualcomm 's negotiating power , mean great degree math chime -- well , great degree , 's based volume , complexity , asp , end market viscerally want adopt qualcomm business vendor . would point thought add matt ? yes , 've got another point add legal side . agree anand said layered 're thinking ip agreement . think 's worth noting ip enforcement -- ip enforcement going china right . china last couple year built specialized intellectual property court . i'm kind recognizing reputation enforcing ip , particularly ip belonging country abroad . set series specialized court , main one hear beijing 's got astronomical win rate foreign plaintiff trying enforce ip china . , think -- remedy court offer blocking export good infringing licensed china outside world . , term legal case give qualcomm kind go china ndrc deal hand lot leverage company selling china , product -- win legal case potentially block sale , inventory put hold , also block shipment device outside world . , case , qualcomm little bit leverage new legal trend 've seen enforcement intellectual property china . , kind 'll add cover anand 's comment . got . thanks . another question large number chinese licensee calculate value device , service , strong precedent apple lawsuit . answer , yes . remember , everybody matt larson anand srinivasanoffered china ndrc deal , many handset maker making product consumption china consumption overseas . , ndrc n't necessarily purview address . degree , sort limit thing little bit , number one . number two , also look apple example , apple samsung explicitly understand offered ndrc deal everybody . also -- handset oem , wanted limit number skus supply chain logistics management n't run away . look apple skus , still fewest number skus large handset oem block . look samsung example , 's lot variety platform , lot ﬂavors , lot diversity across price point . look apple , example , expanded number ﬂavors ice cream shop may expanded . nowhere near variety price point diversity somebody like samsung offer . anand , one point 'll note , term precedent chinese licensee . look timeline apple lay 's complaint apple-qualcomm litigation , timing ndrc settlement corresponds roughly offer qualcomm made apple attempting negotiate direct license 2015 've done quite well . kind look , 've laid parallel . suggestion least qualcomm approached apple number . take apple currently getting better deal , take step back . 's going factor fairly heavily dispute . think 's -- 're qualcomm feeling good ndrc , least perceived somewhat hostile review outside force might protectionist interest approved licensing regime 're trying negotiate apple . think certainly bare pretty heavily dispute licensing dispute , get past kind initial stage end year . case move , see kind company issued subpoena course -- due course business 'll see licensing agreement company bearing happens [ ph ] , reference tcl , ericsson case went trial february ended march . licensing agreement pretty much everybody industry , sort judge compare see frand rate lining . 's long answer short term yeah , think chinese license bear pretty heavily dispute . got . thank , matt . another seamless plug bloomberg intelligence . see diversity research different kind people bring equation looking situation like . matt larson intellectual property attorney , jen rie antitrust lawyer training practice . phenomenal group talent 've able bring together ass situation like . work , including slide today found bi go .
