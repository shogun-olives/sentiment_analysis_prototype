'll put number around , 'll look worldwide iot opportunity , 'll also look iot vendor landscape macro perspective , 'll dive iot platform market , specifically . talked idea iot ecosystem , reason need think ecosystem perspective fact complex set technology service required make happen . , think iot enterprise perspective , think decision make , right . first think thing want connect thing could anything chipset module industrial asset consumer device consumer good , refrigerator . think kind connectivity need 's lot option well , everything ranging cellular new low power wide area technology , wifi , satellite , even fixed connectivity still much part iot implementation . need think infrastructure 's going support implementation , could include thing like gateway router piece equipment need . think software component stock . iot platform help u build manage application , well managing device think going gain intelligence data , analytics layer go . also iot specific application oriented towards horizontal vertical use case . think bring together , see service provider playing important role ecosystem consulting perspective , implementation perspective , providing managed service , support service , really need kind glue help u tie solution together . think security really considered holistically across entire stack . really lot organization think 're looking deploy iot technology . think key theme 're seeing 2018 , find budget starting earmarked iot project often happening within scope broader digital transformation initiative . survey every single year ask close 4,000 decision maker worldwide plan iot . , 2016 , found 30 something percent organization budget place iot project . survey 2017 percentage jumped close 70 % . huge spike one year really show organization starting take seriously . also find market opportunity increasingly becoming used-case driven , therefore , vendor sort narrowing strategy become focused various vertical industry various use case support need industry . 're finding organization n't necessarily seeking iot technology , case vertical n't even refer iot they're really looking iot technology support certain business call . see cloud underlying enabling capability iot success , going give u scale , increasingly understand edge also taking additional significance . talk edge , capability compute closer source data generation . analytics artificial intelligence really forefront discussion . today , go technology conference hear ai , ai , ai , talk iot 's really important remember building block place start applying type advanced analytics data . need right connectivity , need able manage device getting reliable data make sure implementation secure holistic perspective . also see increasing acknowledgement skill shortage holding back iot project today . think driver inhibitor iot investment . touched challenge , survey every single year security come number one inhibitor iot project . 're really increasing potential attack surface quite bit extend beyond traditional sort perimeter , kind went traditional perimeter , mobile device , imagine iot perimeter , 're really , really increasing surface area multitude . cost always second challenge project think iot project . , 's lot piece part go . going lot service go well . 's lot upfront cost , think ongoing cost , connectivity part , right . usually going something , ongoing cost related connectivity well usual ongoing cost part kind project . privacy concern definitely raised forefront iot think retail strategy put beacon track location store tracking perhaps demographic . thing - - bring real privacy concern . concern technology stability capability , think 're getting point 2018 becoming stability around technology , still talking emerging space significant concern . , finally , talked lack skill challenge , lack skill term embedded technology need , lack skill term bring solution together , lack skill analytics data science side , really need bring solution market . term driver , meaningful driver place 's despite challenge organization planning move forward initiative . opportunity improve business productivity think , say , manufacturing perspective , could dynamic scheduling factory , predictive quality , automation within factory , ability reduce cost . think smart city , example . smart lighting system save lot energy cost , thing smart building system . moving eﬃciency customer important driver think supply chain . improvement make supply chain impact customer downstream whole value chain . internal maintenance cost , 'll talk manufacturing lot session today , sort largest used-case see today , largest vertical area vertical spend , many biggest use case come manufacturing . , think , opportunity predictive maintenance machine , therefore , save cost maintenance . , finally , improving customer experience . think retail perspective . yes , 's little bit nerve-racking think something tracking u , , time , 'll able personalized experience offered u . , also , also think new service-based product offered iot data . instead buy asset , buy service asset . look spending perspective , believe iot spending grow $ 1.1 trillion 2021 growing rate 14.4 % forecast period . know sound like really big number , , , think different technology going spending . hardware component , software component , connectivity component , 's service component well . tracking , think , close 75 use case iot spending guide right , 's obviously one piece puzzle . going hundred use -- iot use case . going , pervasive 's think number really going significant move forecast period . see , asia-pacific lead spending north america coming second emea coming third , 'll speak regional trend next slide . , , think iot spending , 'll touch sort mega trend driving spending across region top use case across region . north america , really mega trend digital transformation . one main driver adopting iot within north america need reduce operational cost could something like headcount within organization fuel saving ﬂeet . north america , manufacturing transportation logistics two largest use case , say , vertical . europe , process automation really top driver iot spending today . key trend really trend around industry . europe , manufacturing also top vertical term spending . end forecast period , also see consumer industry spending going make significant amount spend region . asia-pacific , improving internal eﬃciencies top driver iot project . , manufacturing number one vertical spending region , followed utility transportation well . , trend asia- pacific driving spending still initiative like made china 2025 certainly manufacturing space . also fact 's kind rise middle class asia-pacific . japan , 's lot effort around connected society . , go region region , see difference 's driving iot spending , manufacturing kind constant term -- top vertical iot spending across world . look iot vendor perspective , discussed , technology sack includes broad range technology , 's surprise lot vendor participate space . 've broken hardware , software service , standard body industry solution . , , 've grouped way , think way organization go building iot solution , make lot decision 's lot different vendor choose . , think 's one key takeaway slide . also want call attention iot platform component slide , , sort , right middle . think important point , first , take lot real estate . space lot vendor participating point , organization make iot platform decision vacuum , right . think hardware need connect platform , need think analytics 're going leverage data collect platform , think standard platform support , think industry , specific industry solution want adopt run platform 're going bring together . 'll get platform little bit couple minute , wanted call attention particular slide . , , think iot macro perspective , one question ask survey mentioned year-after-year , type vendor think going likely lead iot ? earlier day fielding survey , hardware vendor , sort , top list . we've seen shift last couple year software analytics vendor risen top , believe market maturity taking place , right . beginning market everybody really thinking potential thing connect going connect . 's moving , okay , may handle piece hardware want connect connectivity , need think , well , end goal , insight want gather data . , attention focused software analytics component stock . , next question asked , okay , think , instance , software vendor going really kind thought leader space one really making lot money . , think going make money ? , result asked different category , person able sort give viewpoint category . , think 's couple important point take away slide . first , asking perception . , , , perception versus actually making money right ? think today -- example , software analytics area , google came number three , google n't actually commercial offering key space -- well , enterprise side anyway , really -- really focused product 2017. perception point google could leader , think certainly 's driven 're consumer side also focus around analytics everything they've done ai . think another , sort , telling aspect also siemens ot side , 've really began kind mature commercial iot offering market last year , , perception perspective , ranked number one . , think 's interesting kind understand -- really interesting term like think mindshare market think 's job sort track revenue shake next year respective space . slide also really reinforces idea iot ecosystem one vendor dominate space entirely . okay . 're going move discussion specifically around iot platform , really see iot platform essential component iot stack . 've following space , may heard hundred - - think number get tossed around last 400 iot platform market . idc n't quite look way , bit narrow definition include iot platform space . u classified iot platform within market sizing , platform connectivity component device management component . usually offering solid [ ph ] data ingestion , processing management mechanism part , connect device , start getting data device , need able ingest store processing piece come -- get stored need run analytic real-time . visualization tool usually part platform product well , , , data wo n't able visualize . kind four key component see making iot platform , one product u consider iot platform . , 's iot visualization tool , n't consider full-on platform , iot visualization tool . sometimes product include application development tool , sometimes include advanced analytics . 's included pricing consider part platform , 's , n't . term architecture , 'll talk bit minute , really think platform support distributed computing . talked idea cloud important . cloud , call , core , could centralized data center , could cloud could on-premises data center , 's centralized data center , , say , mid , factory ﬂoor , manufacturing -- manufacturing , example . security sort run throughout stack . n't see kind -- standalone security product , would n't consider iot platform . u , iot platform security architected , also think platform increasingly apis integrate business system , lot time raw iot data meaningful , combine point context make meaningful . , look iot platform vendor perspective , 's crowded space 's interesting look , map nicely . first slide showed , sort showed iot technology stack thing service . 've got company vendor make thing fit iot platform . , could machine , could chip set , could cellular module . 've got vendor build network equipment -- heavily involved space . 've got vendor run connectivity network platform , 've got analytics application cloud vendor participating , service vendor well . service vendor , sometimes proprietary platform , usually offer partner platform well , focus really generating service revenue 's le allegiance one specific software platform . 's finding right fit customer . , obviously , 's lot competition . think , think necessarily winner-takes-all strategy iot platform war . think winner emerge category , play together , think , nobody 's vendor landscape really positioned sort lead across area , partner . see evidence 's taking place ecosystem last couple year . 's partnership across application development cloud , edge , connectivity management device management talk couple example bring life . look application development , aws obviously offer number web service really building block build solution . salesforce brings customer contact situation , customer might build underlying sort iot infrastructure , software infrastructure , say , aws , want bring point context application , might leverage salesforce 's iot solution concert bring . , talked idea adding context iot data . cloud space , one thing 've seen organization really focused cloud infrastructure like google , microsoft , amazon , certainly focused cloud strategy , vendor cloud strategy le focused infrastructure piece trying multi-cloud give customer 's choice . sap , ge digital , ptc example company really trying focus platform-as-a- service layer 're partnering cloud infrastructure provider . customer want run paas google iaa , 're able instead run sap 's cloud . edge infrastructure side , got number organization provide gateway hardware , think running application hardware , instance , ibm sdk , run ibm iot watson application cisco gateway . connectivity management space , cisco -- piece , 're talking cisco jasper . cisco jasper integrated many mobile operator network around world . ibm microsoft , n't necessarily make whole lot sense try make effort well , make sense customer want iot deployment cellular partner ericsson cisco jasper . device management side , lot partnership , lot different provider device hardware know manage better company originally manufactured , right . bosch ibm good example , ibm partnered bosch -- bosch 's device management software . , , partnership across space think 've come sort see iot platform ecosystem within broader iot ecosystem , key attribute winning platform player . talk ecosystem partnership like [ ph ] believe point , standard support really important . 's lot different standard need understand standard important industry support . 's really important focus use case . , n't see customer necessarily going saying want buy iot platform , want piece technology support use case . 's going important developer ecosystem . anytime talk platform , want developer think cloud momentum also important , talked scale , also lot developer interest pulled day . 're big cloud provider strong developer ecosystem , going enhance iot strategy . analytics really important , get value data , think iot platform player need strong analytic strategy . 've got get pricing right . 've seen many iot platform player slashed pricing last year 50 % , pricing model high think data customer want run analytics store . iot global nature talked earlier , whether 're multinational organization 're manufacturer shipping product world , going think global connectivity , 've think global language support , global tech support , platform player really strong global capability . okay . finishing quick view future platform . , , really think idea edge cloud edge core architecture really important , increasingly cost send everything cloud , security issue , concern around latency bandwidth , organization going want process data closer point generation . platform provider , need able support application wherever need run . think trend around container serverless computing valuable platform . container offer portability , important 're talking heterogeneous endpoint environment . serverless computing really allows u take event-driven approach iot , save u cost 're spinning computing see certain event happen , instead running time . also think blockchain going interesting technology intersection iot certain use case like around supply chain track trace . term functional enhancement , think rapid application development tool added platform , allow people organization participate development process . idea digital twin augmented reality taking digital -- taking physical world making digital going really key trend -- especially industry iot , integration device , organization want on-board million iot endpoint make process simpler . talked contextual integration , could customer data , could weather , could location . data monetization tool , start build new revenue model based data . term consumption , 's going go two way . one hand , depends -- depends buying platform . 's technical sale , need micro service available , -- technical person , kind , buy piece part need . hand , 's line business sale , happen lot iot , need application go-to-market . , think actually quite useful platform vendor able offer approach anurag rana stacy crookmarket . 's see momentum market happening next year . , today . contact information anybody question n't get answered within q & session today , feel free reach afterwards . 's . thank much , stacy , good overview . request listener , question , please type read stacy . stacy let talk little bit something learned cloud , general , , look cloud architecture cloud , could say one reason going cloud , little secure , would say , far secure , homogeneous architecture compared combination lot internal patched together year . look iot space , really n't , mentioned , one large mega provider going back construct service company patching together relationship , product , going come , , business model ﬂawed security would , thing take , might actually come pretty quickly . think 's really astute observation . think 're going see happen leading cloud provider going take initiative move space -- either n't 're going create really tight partnership leading technology provider . think one example 've seen cloud provider moving cloud technology actually outside cloud , right . first thing we've seen 're taking cloud technology allowing customer run on- premise . , -- like azure , take microsoft , example , azure stack good example . iot , 're moving even , like 'll continue microsoft . , azure iot edge , kind taking bunch web service running even cloud smaller iot endpoint . introduced recently fear , something -- operating system microcontroller , like end iot endpoint usually . see cloud provider one -- taking initiative create -- part reason 're , right , create secure , trade net chain trust end -- way end iot back cloud , going complete piece computing say microsoft might like gateway . think 'll see company , like talked example ibm cisco , coming together create partnership around iot . 's think happen . 's service provider wo n't still play important role , think anurag rana stacy crook anurag ranatechnology vendor going increasingly take upon create chain trust within solution extent , also form really close alliance major technology provider needed . , 's fairly detailed discussion . , one thing also seen digging around topic last month , edge computing service launched cloud provider fairly new . mean , think -- 's -- perhaps 2 year old , concept helping adoption rate , mentioned , mean , also hearing service company implementing project project size improving enterprise adoption going , -- key reason see anything else 's driving adoption rate ? think 's part , right . think manufacturing -- -- majority iot spend within manufacturing space . edge important industrial iot , right . lot organization , going send , talk , going send certain piece information probably never going go cloud . , really important able adopt iot know , keep information factory ﬂoor whatever private network need keep within . actually think edge computing technology going make much realistic manufacturing oil gas think fact 're oilfield middle nowhere , n't connectivity time . 's different challenge 're driving , think 's definitely one part . think also digital transformation effort become mature , iot really sit hand hand digital transformation effort . see maturity happening , think 'll see . also think analytics technology mature , also really going help push iot forward . one really key component two connectivity . mean cellular connectivity , 's expensive . -- wifi 's fine , talk somebody 's mobile use case , think increasing prevalence lpwan network also help move forward . , think 've got number trend converging help start pushing iot forward . thanks . another one mind . look vendor currently amongst top list , general electric pop number industrial company , mentioned siemens bosch . , -- least general electric stacy crook anurag rana stacy crookbeen talking many year , seems like n't look like level traction would expected three year ago recently saw partner microsoft , example , -- use azure back-end predix application . , trend see going forward well industrial company use tech company backbone would interesting selling higher value service ? cloud provider final winner case ? , think see trend happening . think ge , mentioned , ge digital moving direction , bosch also moving direction , 're running various component iot suite public cloud . talked abb day , really highly invested azure platform iot solution . icg done , moving towards iot solution application focus , think company realized running infrastructure application core competency , -- take lot resource effort . think they're really trying focus core competency core competency knowing industry well understanding specific use case value 're trying get , think going focus analytics application layer versus infrastructure moving forward . got . one interesting use case 've seen salesforce device connected crm system message sent people 's mobile device e-mail thing potentially breaking , interesting concept , -- n't look like device management side , crm side . vendor kind cooler stuff arena ? know mentioned google , n't sure something like ? , think think salesforce , yes , adding context piece . company sort competing crm space going look similar , look similar strategy , right . think think way oracle , sap , microsoft started think iot , thinking -- even ge , servicemax acquisition thinking make -- improve customer service field service organization , create personalized experience . customer staying hotel know every time come hotel , like , n't know , order meal room service . think 's something 's looked . ibm one watch space ibm assistant 've recently launched iot , think company , 're participating ai space , company strategy , 'll look see anurag rana stacy crook anurag ranathey combine iot ai create better personalization . seems lot interesting thing going . one final question 's blockchain . mean , 's something that's obviously news lot lot reason . kind use case come iot ? kind , guess , solution/applications see emerging ? , yeah , think -- let say , think kind three big place , big application 're looking right . plan write research , soon sort detail . think anything track trace component interesting use iot blockchain . thing 's moving supply chain logistics could transmitting data could transmitting data blockchain , -- blockchain verifying true , product end wherever 's supposed go . something go wrong product , say 's food ; food reach end destination 's spoiled , find exactly logistics process happened , say plane , sending back information verified blockchain refrigerator temperature x , , z time . later process , maybe see refrigerator -- temperature supposed , also verified blockchain , -- verifies , give u better verification something may gone wrong process getting food someone . think another interesting use case blockchain iot security . think traditional security model , something authenticating centralized authenticator . iot might time make trip . authentication service cloud , might time make trip cloud back . peer peer security model iot could interesting . ( technical diﬃculty ) iot blockchain like distributed model . another interesting use case could monetization . use cryptocurrency way pay something within iot , think blockchain iot coming together iot monetization use case . certain organization like iota one 's really focused use case bringing iot blockchain together . think , iot chain , maybe , another organization look . awesome . stacy , thank much informed session , look forward talking next year get update strategy . 's . thank , everyone . stacy crook great . thank .
