alright , let 's start . know people still kind ﬂocking , -- changing over [ ph ] tight , conference . chris , good see . good [ ph ] see . 's -- different role . maybe let 's start , actually , 's current role ? would define ? sure , sure . thank raimo . 's good see -- good back saddle telling mike earlier today . 've current role two year -- two year , currently head finance cfo cloud ai division . think familiar largely synonymous external reporting segment , call intelligent cloud . encompasses certainly azure , get lot attention , also portfolio includes window server sql server , well business application , actually get reported different segment , that's also responsibility area . alluded , five year previous head ir job , 's good back . chris suh raimo lenschow chris suhyes . okay , perfect . know , also like -- azure big -- one big growth opportunity microsoft everyone kind excited . problem everyone , kind frame . like 's ultimate opportunity . -- 're kind side , way , come like better way like way , actually , kind help u one ? sure . . 's unique business . 's unique -- maybe 's unique . 's unique time industry . think feel super fortunate able participate . every company planet sort thinking , digital state think transforming moving work ﬂows cloud . 's sort -- really generation sort time like find . think microsoft uniquely benefiting couple way . obviously , secular trend talked . sort big population customer thinking move cloud , cost saving , also access service sort modernize environment think accessing security management feature way maybe accessible previously , structural tailwind , , growing market . uniquely continue -- continue deliver great value proposition sort end-to-end cloud solution story , providing sort digit -- asset partnership 've many , many year structurally helping u . tam large . sometimes try put dollar , would say , 're gated anything market standpoint , 's opportunity execute capture . 's german trying -- trying baseball . like , -- like , think ? like , seems like -- think ( inaudible ) last week : invent , talked like 4 % workload actually cloud versus kind 96 % still on-premise . like see kind point journey ? would n't disagree sentiment , vast majority workload remain yet cloud . early day transition . said , feel like 're great position , rich , longstanding , trusted relationship 've vast majority company still running predominantly on-premises , think trusted strategic partner , think good shot partner . think 're best position . , much spur , long game , result think feel great market position . raimo lenschow chris suh raimo lenschow chris suh yeah . talk little bit evolution azure last year , know like -- someone -- aws guy little bit headstart . whereas look customer conversation 'm , last year , thing really changing , customer relationship coming , inside , like evolved evolving ? yeah . 's interesting . market evolved . said , think feel good position momentum business . significant scale still growing high rate , 63 % know , last quarter . sense , like value proposition differentiation changed much . start viewed strategic partner , said , customer . mean ability offer sort broad stack cloud solution , whether 's azure infrastructure side , application oﬃce dynamic , way m365 offering . , ability help customer solve solution comprehensive way . secondly , cadence innovation . mean , continue launch new product continue expand portfolio , solve problem talked . thirdly maybe importantly commitment hybrid approach , 's consistent since day one . think 've seen lot competitor sort embrace hybrid , think validation -- view world one 's playing way . hybrid u always meant , like hybrid core mean 's informed way built architected product . 's informed way 've brought service market . really consistency experience on-prem cloud , edge , 've sort embracing committed hybrid day one , think 's real differentiator . think 're really true hybrid provider provide consistency set solution on-prem cloud edge , think continues resonate customer , sort continue long strategic conversation enterprise customer tends number one differentiator . talk little bit , well , azure side ( inaudible ) . azure side , like , call -- -- kind sometimes call premium service . talk little bit mix see , -- think mobile product part like , azure evolving like different product offering ? raimo lenschow chris suh raimo lenschowit 's good question get one frequency . azure product family , 's going continue evolve . sense , 's like 've -- think analogous oﬃce way , right , oﬃce historically synonymous excel , powerpoint , word . time 's -- oﬃce365 offer expansive thing like collaboration communication , well productivity . , sense , like analogy say azure continue evolve . today , think 's commonly thought sort core service within azure , infrastructure iaa taas offering . fastest growing part number see , talk azure growth externally , 's faster growing portion , 's larger dollar contributor . continues consumptive based , see growth within customer like year-on-year , like continue move workload , continue build application consume service . continues grow sort le limited , let 's say , number employee number seat number user . consumptive part business part really excited , obviously . another category revenue within azure business call either saas call per user time . commonly thought em , mobility -- enterprise mobility suite power bi , 's part . 's per user construct sort gated different dynamic consumptive part business . 's still seeing good -- great momentum , saw seat growth last quarter 30 -- 35 % plus , think 36 % last quarter big base . -- usage growth -- like business , many per user model outside oﬃce , within oﬃce -- outside azure , within oﬃce business window business . 'll see growth continue moderate seat growth , , 's different consumptive . really whole thing important u , 's sort benefit comprehensive cloud provider . yeah . -- mean look like iaa , paas think long run probably bigger partner user , -- like finite number . like -- , time , like give like positive mix effect . , . 's larger today 's growing faster 's weighted heavily toward consumptive part business . continues grow faster per user base , mix continue mix , point . fast forward x number year , three , five year whatever number , -- good part even bigger portion . start replicate . talk also like -- little bit premium service . like -- would assume like , advantage corporates [ ph ] , already much heritage software company , chris suh raimo lenschoweveryone else like , either trying steal open source vendor trying make money try develop . journey premium service guy ? yeah . journey . right . 's interesting sort space , talked , like customer really , trying solve one problem . trying solve like , hey , move compute environment 's sort thing 're trying solve , think long-term relationship , like -- customer commits azure five , seven year multi-billion dollar , thinking holistically service , whether internally call core premium , 's sort indifferent customer . thing 're trying solve . 're seeing -- core -- infrastructure side business mature business , 's larger business naturally . therefore 's reﬂecting growth rate mature . -- seeing fast growth sort data service , -- premium service talk . 'd say 're starting -- still much smaller , mixing way , growth rate 're seeing . mean really think customer journey , talked like sort multi , sort billion dollar type commitment . mean , long-term journey . n't move everything . move sort slowly sense . move workload work migrate something . evaluate , optimize . see curve go like sort optimizes figure like going use 're going use grow . see curve go like . 's straight line right . context , 's early day . migration sort first play customer , think window sql environment running outside cloud , migrating azure . 've got great hybrid offer let preserve value migrate . move environment , sort next step innovation , 're app modernization legacy modernization literally building new native cloud application , like seems next phase . course innovating higher scale thing , like sap workload kubernetes thing 're seeing . like sort phase customer journey 're sort part customer engagement . mean touched migration , next question actually . 's funny like , becoming like -- maybe ( inaudible ) , always trusted partner many client , seems coming , tracking like incremental dollar gaining number actually increasing , look bigger field . saw like one competitor last week kind trying point like oh please , need adopt like , better scale . like relationship kind working , chris suh raimo lenschow chris suhknow trust ( inaudible ) client see coming term contract looking , like size contract , 're getting structured etcetera ? seen lot positive momentum . think 've heard amy hood , cfo , talk earnings call . talked number -- let 's say $ 10 million plus deal signed customer . 's great sign trust u , intent long-term partner . use $ 10 million sort arbitrary line , deal think familiar , exceeded nine figure . -- n't , 're buying solution , they're buying partner , buying partnership , strategic partnership , fantastic . seeing , like said , seeing great momentum . think feel great . -- 's early , 's thing . mean like 've signed billion dollar commitment customer , real work still left front , partner customer , figure roadmap transformation , work , architecture standpoint technical standpoint either migrate something spin new project get , call internally , talked getting meter spinning , 's measure consumption , get meter spinning , lot real work done customer , 's fantastic 're committed u , work journey . yeah . okay , perfect . let 's shift gear little bit . bought github , kind fitted right kind microsoft dna , always steep [ ph ] almost developer . think get kind deeper . question like around , azure development , seen impact github part organization , feed azure , help u little ? like way frame raimo . developer really important rich part history . success date partnership rich developer ecosystem . 're exactly right . really important priority u . 've success -- github , 've successful developer ecosystem writing azure initially . think github brings -- way get github operates independently . think know well , like part -- sort new model satya amy sort implemented company like linkedin github , operate independently . yet still obviously connection , nat , run github , report scott guthrie , linkedin business report directly satya . raimo lenschow chris suh raimo lenschow chris suhso strategic alignment , yet operate independently . think 's really nice symbiotic balance two , get github core , continues developer developer ecosystem really healthy , 've continued see think -- satya talked last earnings . continue see momentum growth , number developer grown approximately 30 % , time -- one year 've -- 've part microsoft family . momentum standalone really fantastic . think -- like sense last year , think biggest benefit microsoft , cultural anything . meaning like notion microsoft open platform . notion 're great partner , even company compete . compete customer go market together , think way graceful make sense u . think notion , 've opened microsoft , 've opened whole population developer previously n't really thinking writing azure , predominantly , think super positive move forward sentiment , sort health ecosystem . 's what's important . need careful time . ( inaudible ) . one thing started move ahead competition , like term international buildout . mean data center . know 's still true , data center ( inaudible ) group combined internationally . talk little bit strategy footprint , mean term like adoption ? yeah . data center region . think 's -- n't actually know many data like ... yeah , sorry . yeah , term application . consistent strategy beginning . 've broad globally , thinking data center footprint . 've always belief , long run putting data center place customer want consume data provision service , strategic advantage . 've built datacenter footprint broadly , 54 region around world , region competitor . raimo lenschow chris suhwe think 's long-term strategic advantage , think 's important right . also though mean , add complexity build-out , think ability provision service , though , even though 's complex take -- interesting challenge course , always -- take good signal , take month lead time build data center . good signal , 're geography -- get precise signal -- 're going term capacity need , six month , 12 month , 24 month , sort -- disperse geographic way . -- make execution challenge , think 've done pretty good job . like -- , cfo need kind ask couple financial question well . get question around gross margin lot , talk substantial increase improvement last couple quarter . think , factor investor look , think gross margin profile long run ? sure . think first foremost , try fairly transparent progress commercial cloud gross margin . 's important -- company , 's important measure gross margin , 've seen continue march consistently time , reﬂects progress 've made across business . said , know , oﬃce business -- oﬃce 365 business mature growth phase , mature phase lifecycle , therefore margin closer north star . , see commercial cloud number continuing improve , that's really largely driven right , improvement 're seeing azure , lifecycle . 's 61 % think last quarter commercial platinum , mean 's pretty healthy number across whole stack . said , still think continued room improvement . really predicated thing 've talked , -- sort ability continue expand data center footprint globally , much ahead demand good signal geography , sort optimize enough capacity month road , also , capacity get expensive ineﬃcient . 's also ability continue make improvement eﬃciency stack , hardware software . bunch decision tactical nature build versus leased , sort eﬃciency power management , etcetera , etcetera , go -- drive real margin improvement . would say , given moving part , 're still confident ability say , structurally margin structure -- like -- n't believe different world exists u hyperscalers , term ability reach industry leading margin . path may look little different u others , yes . raimo lenschow chris suh raimo lenschow chris suh raimo lenschow subject like talk kind tech hardware vendor , god bless , -- kind -- last quarter , started complain like , oh hyperscalers pulling back little bit , like negative kind demand signal . look capex number , change . actually , continue kind keep investing healthy pace . kind factor , kind understanding better , like build data center , 's going white label stuff like ? two comment correlated ? 's great question , ca n't really speak sort -- pretty much . could tell see side . like , continue invest stuff talked , term expansion . continue invest ahead demand signal sort waning demand , let 's say , 's plenty demand . 're always going try optimize -- always going try optimize way -- eﬃciency spend . mean , sort could mean , investing sort capability build data center different way , eﬃciency . standpoint , ca n't reconcile comment , could say , capex continues big investment u . see plenty demand horizon , let u continue make investment . perfect . see 22nd place . , wow , good timing . thank much . thank everyone joining .
