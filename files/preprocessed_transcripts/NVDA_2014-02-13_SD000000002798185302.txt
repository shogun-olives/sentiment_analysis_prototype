good morning , everybody . welcome goldman sachs technology internet conference , nvidia presentation . u company today , happy director investor relation , chris evenden . welcome chris . thank . good . chris , reported pretty fun quarter last night high end guidance . guided little bit better -- maybe line seasonal higher base -- much higher base , yes . guess people saying hey , pc back . think clearly desktop business probably strongly notebook business fair say . help u understand underlying dynamic -- really gaming application , , strong beyond pc market . maybe talk kind underlying trend oem pc business well ? yes . geforce product line graphic consumer . informative way think , like , dividing gaming market james schneider chris evendenan oem market . two market different dynamic , jim alluding . although said , actually strong q4 , oem one probably unexpectedly . long-term underlying trend gaming strong oem business weak . oem business princely mainstream notebook . 's lot pressure . mainstream notebook market whole lot pressure , right ? know . think 's additional pressure within graphic within mainstream notebook well . think 's lot pressure business . gaming , however , actually strong , profitable actually slowly growing business within pc market . take -- ca n't take homogenous view pc market . distinct segment . gaming estimate growing 10 % year . obviously q4 strong quarter gaming . also lot game come q4 people n't buy gpus -- gamers n't buy gpus want better gpu . buy gpus want play battlefield 4 feature turned , want pay blade soul . think reason mentioned blade soul 's game launched china last quarter tencent . 's new departure 's much higher production value typical china . although talking one game , think 's significant difference 's raised level expectation game china look like . pretty excited . china historically 40 % geforce revenue , rule thumb . get moving term asp , 's exciting opportunity u . dynamic , market strong . would say longer-term underlying trend pc gaming continue strong . oem think somewhat headwind next 12 month . seeing kind tailwind market share versus amd , kind strong share , still ﬂat market 're ? market share number come today tomorrow , think . see . word caution market share number , 're unit share 's lot difference oem business gaming business term asp term gross margin well . actually move -- excuse , move market share significantly actually probably move profit dollar ( inaudible ) one quarter like q3 last year . actually lost market share . increased dollar share market . 's good data market share one data point . 've got cautious interpreting literally money made higher-end business . high-end , 'm talking graphic card retail like $ 150 , $ 1000 . james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evendenreally starting sort level . 's stupendously expensive . 's money going . got . relative q1 guidance , think guided revenue think 8 % sequentially midpoint . maybe talk moving piece within , clearly 's lot . one tegra seasonality particularly weaker q1 . nobody really know seasonality tesla professional business . help u kind break apart seasonality core pc gaming franchise versus rest . yes , think seasonality really dangerous concept come nvidia , think implies know something n't . look historically business done , probably underlying seasonality . god 's lot noise top seasonality well . 's diﬃcult use basis . , term guiding q1 , think guided pretty much line everybody else . stronger q4 everybody else . even go 8 % , midpoint q1 , still give u stronger -- look like q3 q1 , still stronger pretty much peer think q3 q1 . think 's good guidance . 10 % year-on-year . moving part within , certainly geforce business significantly , desktop -- gaming oem significantly period time . professional business strong think . offset . tegra wherever tegra end . 's helpful . want kind switch near term kind product side thing minute . announced latest tegra series , tegra k1 , back consumer electronics show . think metric put around , say , 65 % le power given performance 40 % performance given power . think 's said . basically , help u understand first advantage k1 relative tegra 4 past advantage relative competitor like qualcomm-based solution even competitive solution like x o apple ipad ? yes . question answer . 's first time 've got pc plus gpu inside mobile power . fit -- n't get wrong , fit within mobile power run 5 watt tablet , run 2 watt phone still term per watt raw performance . pc class . mean ? mean feature open gl directtouch 11. worked epic support unreal engine 4 . unreal engine one james schneider chris evendenthe popular game engine world today . mean make easy game developer take game already exists another platform make pretty trivial actually port tegra k1 . fact , one demo showed analyst day pc demo running tegra k1 . another one ( inaudible ) ce . one pc demo running tegra k1 unreal engine . another one actually ps4 demo think unreal engine tegra k1 . show easy transfer contract across . course , 's big deal software developer 's little incremental asset make game available android . thing brings cuda , gpu general-purpose gpu program ( inaudible ) cuda 192 processor core mobile . give lot option term feature add , gpu good taking data turning image , 's actually really good taking image turning data . image processing . bunch highly powered computing task well . demonstrated automotive context term identifying white line road , reading road sign side , measuring distance car front , thing . fundamental building block advanced driver assistance system . phone tablet well gesture control , facial recognition apps , high-definition -- high dynamic range photography , apps run cuda well . 's lot feature performance brings n't . 's n't call tegra 5 felt suﬃciently big ( inaudible ) emphasize fact 's got kepler core tegra k1 well term . 's differentiation . 's part fundamental strategy term gaming android . android , , ubiquitous ; 's everywhere . believe android matures platform , distinct segment crystallize , , android market . one gaming . vanguard intend incumbent market solidifies . part -- 's bit chicken egg problem sense game developer n't want develop game 've got installed base . hardware manufacturer n't want build installed base 've got game . invest build gaming ecosystem android tegra k1 part investment . shield part investment . game work team tony tamasi part investment well . team several hundred engineer work game developer bring content platform . thing think build gaming android . that's build strong , defensible , profitable segment . mentioned ( inaudible ) side get back . look kind rest tegra focused , much see tablet platform versus smart phone platform . think kind dual core quad core version product ? james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evendenso definitely tablet phone . said last year well . jammy came along big phone . would say , strategically , 's much focused tablet . 's room differentiate visual experience bigger screen fundamentally . yes , 'd put way . dual core versus quad ? depends application . 's hard specific . 's certain amount generously call market texture . come eight- core processor eight core obviously better four . even though ca n't actually demonstrate real-world sense , work consumer . eight bigger number four . definitely help . place type architecture . importance 64-bit nvidia ? another market texture kind thing , actually real application ( multiple speaker ) really wanting use ( multiple speaker ) software ? silicon chicken egg situation well , need 64 apps take advantage architecture 'll come . clearly market going direction . five year ' time , wo n't debate 32 bit versus 64 bit . everyone 64 bit whole range . question benefit accrue first ? think first . think benefit u sense . apps support 64-bit . 's fact pitch consumer 've got 64-bit tablet guy got 32-bit tablet . 's absolutely element . absolutely well feature application take advantage 64-bit architecture 's available . got . want understand modem strategy , area made investment acquisition icera . 've definitely done proof point last year got cagr certified . think -- 's pretty big success . yes . james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden talk critical integrated modem versus discrete modem overall mobile strategy ? 's really diﬃcult . thought going ask much easier question . think modem -- let answer easy question 'll change subject move . modem think incredibly important . think connectivity cellular connectivity going crucial whether 're car , whether tablet , whether 're shield-like gaming device . whether need discrete integrated actually much diﬃcult philosophical question . integrated , principal advantage integrated 's cheaper . argue also power segment . power segment really trivial meaningful sense . 's also ﬂoor plan saving integrated . space play , ﬂoor plan pretty darn big , 4.3-inch phone . really constrained ﬂoor plan . stand cost-saving . compete high end . relatively small cost saving make break feature . , advantage going discrete interact quickly reduce risk iterate separately two complex process time without impelling schedule . play , discrete actually good solution . said , absolutely market segment point get price becomes imperative . point , integrated becomes much important . want kind touch obvious question design win , think 've couple different juncture past performance leadership , 've blown away competition positive performance , different kind performance metric . really n't translated market share . give confidence year going year 's different term either tablet smartphone design win . something simply looking mobile world congress computex beyond say ah , understand ? think design win traction importantly outward visibility ? yes . pretty good visibility certainly phone side , le tablet shorter product cycle . 's diﬃcult discus james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evendenwithout verging guiding year . absolutely want guide year , proven diﬃcult thought think . tegra k1 32-bit device shipping first half . 64-bit device shipping second half . tegra 4i smartphones shipping first half well . term number stuff , n't want dive rat hole . understand . think k1 first one 've kind introduced denver core talked -- yes . 've talked denver core long time . really bring table developer , consumer . -- 's first 64-bit platform available . give performance feature 64-bit platform . give adjustable memory space 64-bit platform . think 're first market . certainly 're first demonstrate android running 64-bit . 'll see go . kind -- threshold performance example automotive market machine vision kind stuff could n't got n't 64-bit ? capital application say really crossed threshold enables ( multiple speaker ) application ? 's really good question . 'm sure 've got good answer . image processing run cuda course , fully programmable gpu much power-eﬃcient place image analysis cpu . 've got 192 core . 're running massively parallel problem like image processing , make much sense gpu cpu . n't good example 64-bit enables different platform . 'm sure somewhere . 'll work figure -- get example . right . james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider kind next natural question related , hey , 've got data center player grid tesla . etc . 64-bit arm processor market lot performance . go several market ? well , 's different ( inaudible ) . differentiation service today power processing , whether 's tesla grid , power processing . 's different 's -- 's succeeding . mean , look tesla . tesla growing strongly . grew 37 % last year year-on-year would expect carry growing year well . 's , profitable business , know . grid , n't revenue point right . -- number trial increasing . increased 40 % quarter quarter number trial . purchase cycle enterprise 18 24 month . 's turn revenue . n't revenue number point . right look pretty interesting . going like general arm server ( inaudible ) something like , need differentiator . cavium mcc would talk networking infrastructure amd would well extent amd would probably also talk real experience year opteron business . intel . rumor qualcomm , samsung . bunch people space well . think 's going hard-fought space small number customer well . look market think sound like big market actually 's probably , 've gone first three customer , suddenly much smaller market think . 's diﬃcult place . never say never . right look like diﬃcult place . thanks . thanks , yes . okay , got . automotive , one 've clearly demonstrated level traction audi kind self-driving car , machine vision kind capability . chris evenden james schneider chris evendenand actually given number . 've said believe $ 450 million calendar 2015 think around $ 100 million last year . yes . go -- 's increasing rapid rate . think said -- say $ 100 million , $ 200 million , $ 400 million . number gave . mentioned earnings call yesterday , $ 2 billion pipeline . think 's number confident n't know exactly $ 2 billion going arrive . model moving different quarter . basic point there's billion dollar order commitment . order ( technical diﬃculty ) technical term . commitment , design win pipeline . 's obviously good business product cycle long . real differentiation business well , regard processing advanced driver system , everyone looking . also term actually even raw graphic performance starting really matter car , whether 's quickly nav system update . announces many update second , 's really annoying . go moving full digital dash . instead physical dial needle , -- actually pixel . 's audi announcing ce -- part audi announcing tegra 3 going powering next generation digital cockpit . graphic actually matter quality expense , quality experience car heavily inﬂuenced quality ( inaudible ) 's around 's interface car large extent . used , inlaid walnut handstitched leather dash said something quality car , really quality pixel . got especially good quality display . 've experience look car put electronics wrong . think 's going important differentiator u . interesting . related point , sign post look say oh wow , see design coming . going auto show ce come ? yes . 've got design win people might even announce year 's ( inaudible ) design long . two largest customer right volkswagen audi group bmw . whole range audi car think a3 . golf , volkswagen golf . always interesting debate marketing department whenever produce slide , like put tesla lamborghini automotive slide . would like put golf automotive slide . james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneiderwe bmw i3 . going i8 launched . 3 , 5 7. tesla obviously . 're whole bunch -- skoda actually . european room , 'll actually recognize brand . well skoda come long way . point bentley lamborghini . go full gamut . another couple major automotive manufacture n't announced yet . part $ 2 billion pipeline well . great . want shift core gpu business second . maxwell product said going launch year . 's lot speculation trade press kind relatively imminent . 's 20 nanometer product . 's personal growth reading form , know , right ? know firsthand . help u understand ? understand n't want preannounce product today . understand ( spagie ) macro , come whether expect kind traditional nvidia launch kind start high end waterfall ( inaudible ) ? 's much want say absolutely nothing say . 'll talk -- never talk product announced . -- gpu market , competitive market . product quite perishable . typically six-month like cycle 're done move onto next one . want maximize every hour revenue generating ability product . literally , launch , 're almost always actually available sale day . n't tip hand competitor . 'll find maxwell matter , people buy . n't matter say maxwell right one buy anyway . matter competitive maxwell launch . obviously make empty statement great feel 's going . 'll see review go live . want ask notebook business , 's still material chunk business . talked dynamic . want ask market share think time certainly visibility happened back-to-school , etc . talk directionally feel notebook oem share position head end year ? chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden visibility . 'm sure want share much . oem -- thing introduces uncertainty exactly oems refresh line . cadence -- change cadence , number . probably n't talk n't actually know certain right . know design slot 'm know 're scheduled start shipping . know design n't win . know 're scheduled start shipping . know translate market share . like said , market share data , 's great . hand , 've got careful 's swayed large number low-value unit low profit well . find -- fact , q3 last year , actually , according mercury number , market share went . dollar share clearly went . careful -- data good . n't want steer anyone away using data ever . hand want caution people reading much misleading term market share unit . unit -- gpu 's $ 12 making 25 % gross margin low end ship 1 million hardly shift profit dollar one company . yes . switching professional second -- talking profit dollar . yes , exactly . let 's go one extreme . quadro actually pretty good last year , think . guess part -- best year ever actually quadro last year . actually , 's record . yes . think part tablet refresh . part arguably kind customer set coming back , automotive , industrial -- yes . james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden -- ( multiple speaker ) use , cyclical balance . big growth quadro . head 2014 , think normalize , see continued headwind kind overall market ? 's impact think term product launch anniversarying whatever ? rbc tell u 81 % market share , unit share workstation . believe 90 % dollar share . mean market movement significant share gain loss . , bunch initiative place grow market , intended grow market . nevertheless dominant term equation , like , market actually go . use market data predict quadro go . quadro , 80 % quadro revenue cad-based . manufacturing gdp generally good -- good get term indicator way business going go . would look . look manufacturing going next 12 month , think going strong , would tell something quadro market . think weak time think sort recovered rational level last year . n't see normalizing back particularly . time , would n't want guide towards like 20 % growth something . 's ( multiple speaker ) probably n't grow like last year . 's growth . yes . thank . press room communicator . guess want ask tesla , 's area think 's hard investor kind see like 's really going hood kind buried p & l report . also know 's lumpy , 's tied kind supercomputing specific big customer build . oem based . think tesla business , big last year kind directionally 's going drive growth 2014 ? n't break separately . grew lot last year . grew nearly 40 % year-on- year last year . thing really excites tesla business , actually love tesla business . 's really broken think sense couple year , puttering along sort level $ 25 million quarter thereabouts . james schneider chris evendenand 's sort puzzling clearly -- go hpc show would much enthusiasm much passion 'd see tesla every booth , whether ibm 's booth supermicro 's booth cray 's booth , . people using engineer -- scientist engineer poster session would incredible application tesla . clearly ( inaudible ) yet $ 25 million , $ 25 million , $ 25 million every quarter . 've really broken . think reason 've broken two thing , actually . one , support critical number code work done taking code regular architecture pc parallel architecture like tesla . two , channel term supermicro , dell , hp , ibm , cray , guy . whereas past , year ago 18 month ago , tesla team would gone person engineering firm evangelize product . evangelize first sold shipped , right ? point could guy , researcher johnson & johnson looking protein interaction . know need molecular dynamic , know tesla accelerated molecular dynamic code . know get tesla server ibm . dial ibm salesman get delivered tuesday . 's completely different sale . 's made big difference . think , retrospect , $ 25 million represented team capable personally supporting directly . 've got people supporting u . announcement made last quarter ibm -- gm business think 's significant announcement 've made year sense 've got ibm 's salesperson enthusiastically selling tesla account , pretty big deal . ibm responsible nearly third supercomputing installation worldwide . 's pretty important . also , interestingly , looking applying gpu acceleration enterprise apps well . whole new market u . 's -- long way saying 's reason believe strong growth tesla would continue . would expect strong growth continue . got . 'd remiss ask financial question . 'll ask gross margin first maybe talk capital return quickly . gross margin , 've done great job expanding gross margin , part -- past several year . part intel licensing agreement , gross margin course . part also foundry agreement allowed really kind basically take ownership yield . think 's mostly mix actually , think much expanded gross margin , previous ramp , record gross margin 46.3 % . time , frankly , ati n't produced decent graphic card three year . market . mid-50s % basically . james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evenden james schneider chris evendenwe bit lower last quarter 've guided recover slightly quarter . mid-50s % . 10 point margin n't come intel better negotiation sole supplier semiconductor . 's easy negotiation , might imagine . came mix . developed quadro business . developed tesla business . gaming business becoming profitable well . gpu business becoming affordable . 's whole bunch thing pushed margin 1000 basis point couple year . , sound like would n't expect big structural kind underlying change drive . would mix , said -- 's mix , right . ( multiple speaker ) get profitable professional mix grows -- yes , exactly . oem business declining year tailwind gross margin . tesla growing tail end margin . see good . n't know good . 'll see tegra well . yes , capital return . 've done great job . 've taken $ 1.5 billion ( inaudible ) form convert . presumably 's going mostly share buyback . yes . think appetite even beyond ? clearly firepower balance sheet . yes . $ 1.5 billion give u ﬂexibility ( inaudible ) well . said would return $ 1 billion year . dividend account , rough number , $ 160 million james schneider chris evenden james schneiderthat , maybe $ 180 million , something range . rest share repurchase point year , yes . appetite even ? 's still . 's still . like said , left end year . let 's reconsider , let 's see . great . , think time . thanks , chris , u .
