's - 've taken , specific industry use case 've built technology actually enable used case within existing microsoft cloud horizontal asset . alysa tayloryes , exactly . 's sort like natural progression software , start sort horizontal suite , get asset accelerate time value verticalizing , function packaging point , first-party application top , 's great see . 's like said , one thing 've gotten lot feedback differentiated microsoft azure industry , lot great detail . 'm going stick industry cloud little bit , like said , one favorite topic , mean , obviously , 's built strength microsoft cloud saying . seeing sort across breadth offering ? touched little bit , microsoft offer horizontal suite broad . seeing ? put sort vertical context ? well , look microsoft cloud , start azure global hyperscale platform , look developer asset putting power platform , visual studio able build top cloud platform . application layer . dynamic 365 , microsoft 365 , 's top , 's -- security kind wrap around . 's microsoft cloud . talked , 've released mentioned , seven industry cloud verticalized stack . continue look industry greatest , at-scale need verticalization used case prevalent . one thing 've seen , actually recent industry call offer around sustainability , able bring sustainability especially , 's new regulation coming market , western europe -- european regulation around sustainability carbon emission announced kar 27. use microsoft cloud sustainability meet sustainability goal regulation coming ? , area -- sustainability around taking disparate data , think carbon emission track carbon emission ? thousand different data source . 's bringing data -- bringing data , able organize data actually able report , record report data . , 's capability enabled microsoft cloud sustainability . phil winslow alysa taylor phil winslowand , 's using asset like , data service , -- able out-of- the-box connector thing like standard erp system , able reporting directly system record , use thing like power bi analytics top . 's example , industry cloud , taking specific thing like sustainability bringing market . great . let 's switch gear little bit talk sort go-to-market approach . mean , make microsoft 's approach different ? call product ? something go-to-market motion , sale marketing process , perhaps even unique partnership 've discussed sort specific vertical ? definitely . think go-to-market , start obviously similar talking hearing market ? hearing customer ? hearing partner ? start . go called semester planning cycle . actually work closely like collaboration team , engineering team say , prioritizing . build partner ? partner ? , bringing actual -- probably newest thing , 's -- 've year . semester planning something new 've got rigorous around . actual bring market , would say two facet new continue invest . one account team vertically aligned , 's big change microsoft , deep , deep industry expertise account level , specialist technology layer . 's marriage industry plus deep technical capability brought together across -- subsidiary across world , 's new . ecosystem -- partner ecosystem , continuing make sure , think even industry side azure side , use case 've talked , scenario , making sure system integrator bring bear custom solution . isv ecosystem , brings market extended vertical micro vertical solution , investing 's new capability brought market . marketplace great example able bring partner solution customer quickly , integrated marketplace . , new area investment focus go-to-market .
