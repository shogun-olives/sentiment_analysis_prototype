's going happen ? one thing probably happen , mind , people stop using collaboration . people , happen . people stop communicating way 're . happen . reason , 's way communicate . 's like kind rip phone -- 1990. 's going happen . way people communicated fundamentally changed business leverage every piece data zoom call transcript . team transcript , wherever come transcription ai ml normal , become asset reused part knowledge management 's longer game . difference , two game may played long run best-of-suite solution , microsoft , google , best-of-breed solution 're literally integrating get custom stack need early answer , 's going plenty market . guess coming back would large enterprise go ? end day , n't want deal hundred vendor , n't want use point product hold security , granted integration value proposition around integration , best-of-breed product quite compelling . end day , microsoft offering team fraction price slack charging , guess enterprise would want move bundle level solution getting security posture dealing one vendor opposed multiple vendor . wanted see view anything like seen past nuance large player well zoom slack anything along line ? think honestly good comfort factor working microsoft . also -- -- need may come soon need . that's true , 's microsoft thing , 's true large enterprise suite product . think longer version , watch , manager contacted saying , fine print ? stay free six month , lower price ? lot dynamic lot q - mandeep singh - wayne kurtzmanof manager looking fine print n't want get sucked limited time 's vendor really generous freemium version benefiting , fact many premium version turned paid version , whether line business enterprise . one thing keep saying year , lot collaboration communication product enter line business 's better enterprise . 's easier -- work . go back first slide , people want thing work need look good working home , need able produce 's something balance . get something work ? may mean opening new way purchasing fact way 've . good example , data 2019 show 57 % business surveyed went contract , number almost 50 % year , finding contract always meet need . evolving need enterprise drive could mean little bit ﬂexibility time multiple winner market . got . reminder everyone , question wayne , type question webinar window submit 'll sure take towards end webinar . going back overall market opportunity , one thing , mean know think cagrs slide probably conservative point given demand surge seen tool . think going fade situation normalizes going go back low mid-teens growth ? market share shift going come traditional vendor space cisco webex , logmein , go meet -- citrix gotomeeting people 'll end replacing premise tool traditional premise tool newer tool like zoom , like slack , acceleration market share shift result whole virus situation ? every vendor 've talked , 've wanted move customer cloud . even heavy presence on-prem , many happy hybrid solution , ultimately accelerate . conferencing successful movement cloud , partially zoom success fully cloud . 're also seeing vendor like ringcentral 8x8 successful logmein well . lot company needle say , microsoft google , , included , pretty much everyone every vendor always wanted move cloud , -- one thing hear time time , lot vendor on-prem solution n't want upgrade thing working . unfortunately creates issue rooted user experience often security need . q - mandeep singh - wayne kurtzmanso cloud solution really enables customer get best user experience , believe exception certain security , high security issue , 're going see continued acceleration cloud . 'm quite sure late period cagr ﬂoating around 90 % , caution market 're looking right , excludes telephony vendor buy telephony get software . & , example , . traditional pbx might cloud offering , buy . forecast . 's -- 's cloud percentage high . software market we're seeing jumping traditional cloud , lot vendor made jump . 're starting scale lot basing open source , good . lot place develop really outstanding solution 's almost video . webrtc standard made easy people -- company deliver high-quality solution wrap way turn big deal right . got . mentioned open source freemium lot cio , still reluctant least reluctant whole virus situation deploy freemium open source product . think security remain big concern come single point product deployed cloud may secure framework google suite microsoft suite offer ? security always top foremost number one . protect . protect . 's , -- 've noticed shift last five year , cio report cio gone `` shall way bring , bring , problem solve '' they're learning people probably got fired seven year ago bringing working cio teach , cio add knowledge security governance compliance necessary they're realizing newer product includes zoom , slack , atlassians world , sometimes even cisco webex logmein 's coming really solve larger business problem . successful collaboration see , bottom , top support . nothing -- piece research 90 % saw amazing , amazing result . much 40 , 50 hour additional week retain , full work week people saw 70-hour , 60-hour work week negative . people research found we're copying pasting content email collaboration solution one two people would n't move collab solution . actually slack microsoft integrate solve problem , slack microsoft integration rather clever way , google built day one , q - mandeep singh - wayne kurtzmanthey really never face problem integration . 're getting around , 10 % copy paste system life , 's going feature rolling team started rollout well also feed outlook little better . 're solving problem one time . biggest problem also main issue security , people . given stuff work meet security requirement people going happy much productive . remove barrier , 're going productive . right 's people need feel need also -- cio also adapting non-business conversation , many u , first five minute call , 10 minute call , coping , 's like ? never people like business right 's something 's probably going continue . 're letting home . 's connecting u deeper co-worker , client , prospect way never , also security look little bit differently say , new normal , think 's also going play larger trust discussion 's done data business face near future lot already started discussion . way quantify feature , gap slack microsoft team zoom google hangout like people looking market holistically get sense far ahead slack team far ahead zoom google hangout ? consider , let 's handle one separately . number one : microsoft team slack , different thing . microsoft keep document together nicely , 're best place hold conversation , slack basically take conversation would email put channel integrates oﬃce g suite , keep document conversation together . different . , think , better together leverage thing together ultimately , 'll able leverage , different type ml ai . basically slack 's goal make software 's attached work better fact remove layer friction . keep thing together record , microsoft team , brings science [ ph ] together different way . -- best chat tool yet . n't know want get , -- 're really good getting tremendously better , believe 're better together . q - mandeep singh - wayne kurtzmanif take zoom google hangout meeting solution , different well . personally , miss augmented reality , little crown thing google used n't put business thing , need business tool . need background zoom enables u . need thing easy use . zoom added security feature , changed default , reacted quickly lot , think lot negative hype hype , lot problem user issue take step fix . google , integration g suite . honest , zoom integrate either . 's really -- 's closer game . really want look different benefit available platform , ai , ml , open ml , example , within google suite , g suite allows certain thing may incredibly valuable start moving toward goal knowledge management retaining every conversation way becomes data actually usable later . one big problem '80s , ton data , '90s data , n't know . -- started looking web log sudden , got insight thing used worked point able verge ai training ml really beef depth knowledge around individual work , collective body work 've done team . , slack microsoft team different . think 're better together . zoom g suite hangout meeting , 're closer , differentiation may appeal enterprise -- one another . sector know , think maybe bpo market inadvertently get impacted conference -- conferencing capability good collaboration tool able . think market get disrupted result tool effective collaboration communication ? absolutely . allow better collaboration communication , first , system record slide earlier productivity layer . becomes chain like conversation , help ? well let 's integrate system record . workﬂow ﬂow work , work management becomes one 're process-oriented becomes easy one put . way marketing definitely use product like . anything good kanban board ﬂow apis ai ml become , easy add . 're manufacturing , may actually decide equipment need smarter integrate . 're -- really depends type enterprise 're . generalization , see work q - mandeep singh - wayne kurtzmanmanagement big . see marketing crm integrating . see communication customer , partner like becoming huge . say enterprise community would lag little bit , accelerate . fact , they're accelerating little thought right , longer tail growth . really becomes business unique business going . result covid-19 , company certain thing three year ago may different ﬂavor three year . good example take largest company , walmart , target , go full list , john deere , -- developer portal , making code sharing code , essentially becoming developer sharing code others , partner , beyond . full developer portal , 're growing different level digital transformation think see aggressive company moving growing toward developer powering citizen developer . lot low code , code . allows customize collaborative application use . 're seeing developer come ip level , line business level . 's significant change three year ago accelerate right number vendor making easier code automate certain thing . expect salesforce.com , sap adobe get market either tool , want collaboration conferencing capability within software likely partner like zoom slack ? , actually . adobe partnering aggressively . salesforce really nice solution called quip . purchased number year ago , former ceo , ca n't remember position , charge product . significantly inﬂuencing direction salesforce , also acquisition mulesoft huge salesforce enabled salesforce become open api software . realize future come integration whatever customer need work integrated crm bringing marketing tightly integrate ai ml ( inaudible ) . salesforce -- great developer portal company like mentioned . salesforce actually starting use view , bringing quip front center collaborative platform many thing 've done clever work around . yes , expect collaboration , play ? think adobe made active decision something need business , n't collaborative tool . salesforce , n't see yet . q - mandeep singh - wayne kurtzman q - mandeep singh - wayne kurtzman q - mandeep singhshining spotlight quip , think actually want take step ahead year ahead say , `` hey , collaborative platform '' . got . 've talked length video conferencing e-mail collaboration , content management ? two three vendor like box , dropbox really focus content management one kind segment within cloud software n't taken well know video conferencing slack collaboration discussed . , thought around prospect box dropbox ? yeah . drop -- box dropbox fall , work category . plug , work . n't take long time properly provision security governance compliance need . straightforward . lot promise . , 'm sorry 've left earlier answer . -- everything happening market discussion knowledge management , based content newer form content coming including ar , user generated content becomes increasingly important . content , whole , becomes really important place keep becomes really important , point view , box dropbox continue feature others n't . 're becoming preferred source integrate made integrated . many company last 10 11 year , focused apis integrate 're focused security . got . okay . term deployment model , like mentioned , lot company , started freemium product . think going look way enterprise wide deployment . yes , think tipping point enterprise deploy tool company wide opposed certain line business end using zoom slack , others using something else whole organization probably using on-premise tool ? yeah , n't see lot on-prem . see , go consolidation around like video collaborate -- video conferencing tool people want able use thing work . i'm going back first slide almost every answer . people need thing work cio need thing n't going cause problem . 's two ended sword lot product . yeah . go . - wayne kurtzmanis -- think people call look number 're trying figure , okay , 's durability growth ? virus situation control . mean , people return back oﬃces . hype demand 's going last year , simply -- way quantify , 's enterprise-wide deployment question end day , 's 's going drive adoption . always certain line business using team , result 10 15 people using certain tool , 's drive broader adoption . 's trying get , tipping point yes , people look cue around ? okay , say , yeah , everyone realizes tool much better . look place go enterprise-wide monitor sort activity ? yeah . thank refreshing . enterprise adoption , company 've named seen -- growth rate within company 20 % year . 14 % , little , land expand successful lot company . whether 're talking slack , whether 're talking zoom , whether ability go enterprise wide accelerated covid-19 . tipping point , see growth market least next five year . year-over-year growth n't going hard beat 2020 , percentage , continued growth , everyone jumped ideal solution yet . tipping point still coming . think first , 's going come , already accept video conferencing , facetime , google duo , skype . thing zoom home . n't , people right . adoption video range depending solution 40 % increase 200 % increase . everyone seen increase video help people people thing even extended meeting . team collaboration going come [ ph ] little behind . 's something important chat layer becomes important , starting deploy . enterprise adoption . yes , 's going get pushed wider . one big challenge , company wanted go , wall wall solution sometimes little bit challenge internally first . easy part getting license sometimes . well , understand first week two , phone -- try reach people phone easier online . started maneuvering . tipping point collaboration , 're going see group manager become facilitator command control , core change collaboration group , going exceed production considerably big trade getting thing done , getting market earlier getting project done ahead schedule , something see time time q - mandeep singh - wayne kurtzman q - mandeep singh - wayne kurtzmantype adoption happens whether 's done line business enterprise . keep growing people brought . see normally , want use . work . n't good video system , see . need use collab tool 're using need something different . maybe need kanban board , maybe need trello , asana wrike plug . wanted also communicate 'll able communicate . thus maybe slack team integration become necessary . see different thing , see interoperability several tool enable seamless work collaborative work talking curation data done better . looking new opportunity enterprise 's going come citizen developer within enterprise , 're going come around product support free open apis manager , cio say , want getting people . manage permission whole thing support e-discovery . 're seeing lot 're seeing lot -- lot certification also n't gone . lot solution question , many going top five . think could see good five six strong one collaboration market . le sudden marching moment , certainly team seeing increased adoption , slack seeing crazy strong adoption many player market seeing strong adoption , , 're integrating . 're integrating tool . 've getting lot question security integration integration 'm getting feeling cio happy . lastly , sense installed base top three vendor , three four vendor , talked today , microsoft team , google g suite , zoom slack ? 'm sorry , missed first part little bit . yeah , hoping give listener sense installed base four five product like microsoft team , big installed base relative slack know -- let 's handle one time . n't new installed base number suddenly changed last two month , n't giving . microsoft , 'm interested adoption . stewart butterfield , ceo slack mention yesterday -- number look great yes , team 20 % adoption microsoft oﬃce stack , think announced q - mandeep singhnumbers , higher , people use team , 's diﬃcult learn . good video . slack seen tremendous adoption . -- n't given number indicate much 've grown , one thing note think they've done -- opinion , 've done well maintaining global growth . one thing changing player , percentage revenue per country . dynamic changing fairly substantially would think last two month . question ? certainly , u make majority . zoom installed base , 'm curious many drop-off 're going thing get better ? going retain prior covid-19 , number folk , especially 20 30 consumer purchaser zoom family reason number gone , focused business , think 've go quickly land expand . -- exception one glitch really well . think expanding cisco webex done well , n't talking number , 've going number , 'm comfortable yet saying many retain many . think , rule , see , exclude consumer behavior , see probably 80 % better retention rate business . longer go , higher number go , reason , ca n't pluck something work workforce . got . 's . n't see question queue . concludes webinar . thank joining today . hope useful . reach u , question . replay webinar available later . let 's hope challenging situation soon . everyone stay safe healthy .
