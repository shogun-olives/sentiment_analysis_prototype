'm really delighted colette kress , cfo nvidia , join u share insight industry nvidia , exciting thing company involved . go fireside , want turn colette . opening statement 'll go q & . , welcome colette , . great . thanks , vivek , thanks much u . make open statement . reminder , presentation discussion today , content forward-looking statement investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business . first , let kind make opening statement . nvidia turned corner term announcing earnings several week ago , quarter term record revenue , strength across market platform . reached record total , gaming , data center , well pro vi . strong demand across platform , even work challenge seeing term semiconductor industry 's overall supply . even provided opportunity u reach another record quarter guidance q2 well . see strength gaming data center , work q2 expect market platform well . time overall ampere architecture gaming , ampere architecture data center hitting stride ramping quite well . 'm going turn back vivek see start today 's conference question may . q - vivek arya - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kress q - vivek aryaquestions answer ( question answer ) excellent . thank , colette . maybe let 's start supply side go different demand driver , like mentioned supply one headwind , broad-based industry . way quantify much restricting growth year ? part b , step taking get supply aligned demand ? kind part c , think supply demand start align ? happen year ? 2022 event ? give u color supply situation . sure . 've working supply actually long time . keep mind , demand strong across market platform , issue realize work supply constraint . supply constraint largely apparent gaming business , although product maybe data center term pro vi may also constrained . employed , refer , dual-foundry strategy allows u use full capability supply chain longer planning cycle , helped u current environment seeing . expect supply increase throughout year . expect growth , continue add supply throughout year , expect supply-constraint gaming relates overall channel level probably year , based strong demand seeing . got . colette , dig . supply-constraint gaming , also data center ? kind dual-foundry strategy help align market demand two different market ? yes , -- supply-constraint focused gaming bit effort . keep mind , pleasantly surprised , course , term strong demand saw term gaming , , therefore , put pressure supply . supply growth market well , data center pro vi , keep mind , n't exorbitant amount overall supply thing change term super strong demand going forward . product may limited term supply . got . look second half year , right , expecting second half stronger , assume growth come - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kressgaming 're getting supply ? tied seasonality gaming consumer business perhaps growth gaming ? kind driver second half demand strength mentioned . yes , take u opportunity really look full strategy dual- foundry . expectation , second half year , economy likely continue expand improve post overall covid . overall dual-foundry strategy enabled u provide ampere overall foundry . many work foundry long-term based . we've working building platform -- advanced platform foundry , believe enable growth go second half year . got . let 's step different demand driver , 'll ask one two question crypto , 's focus business . great deal interest . real question , announced step specific crypto mining board , right , processor -- cmp product . much crypto mining exposure nvidia contained within cmp product ? much still think reﬂected gaming segment ? ( technical diﬃculty ) okay , much better mentioned . thought maybe something side . would mind repeating last 10 , 15 second . question , much crypto exposure cmp product ? much reﬂected gaming side ? think missed answer . okay . let try term 're seeing within gaming maybe overall crypto . want first start help folk understand ca n't always see end use card . diﬃcult u determine within gaming much possibly used crypto . could case people duly gaming also using crypto . point time , 's something 're ever going full understanding . take action try steer geforce supply overall gamers . 've done 've created cmp board overall professional miner . cmp board stand crypto mining processor engineered manufactured algorithm overall crypto . additionally , q - vivek arya - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kresshave de-hashed newly manufactured geforce gpus . allows u make sure supply , specifically want game , de-hashing essentially tier [ ph ] overall miner buying geforce card . hope strategy , dual strategy , provide supply geforce gamers . got . colette , go -- 've tried , team tried many time go e-tailer website ebay buy rtx card , right ? selling two , three time msrp . gamers creating level asp inﬂation ? like outside , know enough supply available ? see externally available price kind getting back recommended price ? like , shoe , would monitor supply situation becomes normal ? also , importantly demand really driven gamer -- majority gamer rather majority miner ? sure . let 's first talk overall ampere architecture -- ampere architecture gaming . important architecture . provides tremendous performance leap last generation , 2x better performance seen turing . providing overall ray tracing well , long list new game enabled ray tracing , 130 enabled game overall application . know demand ampere quite strong . adoption right ray tracing within installed base still early level , essentially , believe probably 80 % installed base could still benefit upgrading take advantage overall ray tracing . right strong demand , , therefore , putting strain supply . strain supply , seen increase overall asp see endpoint . , keep mind , lot driven channel driven overall distributor . best help work provide supply , make sure supply geared toward geforce gamers , start see price come back normal manufacturer 's suggested retail price . 's goal looking q2 beyond actually build . believe -- given small amount supply channel today , believe strong demand n't able reach gamers , even though ampere u several quarter . way go term upgrade cycle get bond [ ph ] overall ampere . friend relative came say , colette , best time buy 3070 3080 ? would say , okay , best time actually buy -- one card attractive price ? q - vivek arya - colette kress q - vivek aryawell , several relative asked question , probably even 've asked question , spare one give ? even dear family member able find supply . -- supply available -- market , strongly encourage enjoyment overall gaming card last quite long . ca n't ( inaudible ) control manufactured retail price , channel . hope price come work next quarter improve overall supply gamers . understood . -- colette , mentioned -- le 20 % base upgraded something rtx capable . give u historical ﬂavor 20 % mean ? like , 40 % peak , 50 % peak introduce new architecture ? upgrade cycle usually get ? important aspect -- aspect , 80 % rtx card , kind asp uplift promise upgrade something rtx capable ? okay . let see unpack little bit question regarding 're seeing term overall purchasing . opportunity people upgrade . 80 % still rtx , great opportunity . keep mind , generation past , whether pascal , whether turing ampere , 're correct , 've never reached -- move new architecture , get installed base high percentage installed base . often top gamers upgrade architecture get excited new opportunity within architecture . 's often see people buy multiple time within architecture . 's common u low percentage right 're moving get people towards overall ampere . n't overall specific goal , 's going depend volume increase time fast increased installed base go , 're also seeing new overall gamers joined market . 're seeing overall gaming move entertainment medium using u -- social purpose , see lot creator coming market finding , , opportunity gain well many different use case around . 'll continue watch market try get much supply . 're excited upgrade opportunity going back-to-school season , well holiday coming around corner , . got . possible , colette , -- imagine point , already good idea kind supply available gaming back half , obviously , right , different demand model built gaming , possible gaming growth cycle continues next year , right ? n't want pin specific number , per se . imagine high 100 % year-on-year growth - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kressthat seeing . possible , conceptually , next year also somewhat above-trend kind year term gaming business ? stand right looking forward , idea supply 're getting . keep mind , still work term thinking specifically 'll manufacture put market . still absolutely defined go forward . 're trying determine exact month timing supply demand interesting go back year . step back , though , think gaming -- growth opportunity company . absolutely , think growth opportunity term long- term . 're continuing excite overall ray tracing , ray tracing done transforming overall gaming . continue put best performance type card . 're seeing upgrade , new gamers coming market . 're point think holiday season beyond , think likely see great holiday season beyond gamer always gamer , looking new opportunity purchase overall ampere . got . final question gaming side , much extension growth cycle also fact shortage console side also , assume one driver ray tracing adoption would 's adopted in-game console , probably kind mutual synergy gaming platform , right ? probably stimulates software publisher publish game feature . also something perhaps extending growth cycle next year maybe , get supply console side , also stimulates gaming growth ? correct . entered ampere launch , entered last holiday season , understood season new console return market . really drive overall ecosystem game development . game developer generally writing game wide range different platform , whether console , whether number one platform , meaning pc platform . able attract overall game developer . game developer building rtx game building game new transformation real-time ray tracing . benefited u . 's benefited industry whole , people playing together . 're seeing term overall console nintendo , seeing also mobile form factor , notebook , also strongly increased . mere production new game number one reason attract overall gamers purchasing overall hardware . q - vivek arya - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kress got . let 's go data center side . look data center side , talk u level demand 're seeing right , maybe first start cloud side go enterprise side . cloud demand line think ? mixed picture . intel saying cloud digestion . amd saying , digestion ? n't see . right ? 's -- 's lot mixed picture . separate benefit ampere spending environment . would characterize spending environment among cloud service customer ? okay . let 's start overall data center business saw term q1 . data center business grew 8 % sequentially last quarter , even much industry whole declined period q4 q1 . think overall hyperscale business , remember , hyperscale business incorporates may use internal use , also set overall cloud instance researcher enterprise . hyperscale business double-digits sequentially q4 q1 . really n't see much digestion . , , see term cloud instance , hyperscales , 're focused solving key solution need acceleration , particularly ai solution . 're well aligned top priority see cloud , also see term overall enterprise . see strengthening hyperscale demand , look forward well , probably growing set interest term vertical industry , particularly see coming back oﬃce economy likely improve second half year . expect growth computing networking . hope see solid demand across training inferencing go year . also , launched additional amount product nvidia-certified system -- nvidia ai enterprise software well positioned new vector growth mainstream enterprise tier [ ph ] go forward . got . expect cloud demand stronger second half versus first half ? 's diﬃcult u determine whether cloud increase stem enterprise using cloud enterprise choosing actually bring house going type hybrid model . know hyperscales look build cloud based demand see . try stay ahead see use case continued overall growth . believe enterprise come back market overall economy , many different type solution support , anything cloud purchasing on-premise . q - vivek arya - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kress got . -- believe one thing either jensen said expect kind acceleration data center business . much predicated growth among -- first , much enterprise part overall data center business ? much second half growth predicated enterprise recovery . yes . 've kind talked breakdown data center business hyperscales enterprise . hyperscales -- keep mind , hyperscales , remember , cloud instance use case cloud instance often enterprise . best see we're able divide hyperscales 're seeing term vertical industry . number 50-50 . 50 % coming hyperscales . yes , built data center business supporting 50 % revenue overall vertical industry . focus term ai focused hyperscales . enterprise interested building business support ai well . think second half year , likely see growth hyperscales enterprise , see acceleration going forward , aspect hyperscales building overall cloud , also enterprise coming back oﬃce focusing building workload accelerated ai . got . colette , top application 're seeing enterprise kind gravitating towards using nvidia product ? wow , 's lot different thing enabled helping stitched together product solution platform may want term enterprise industry . focused many different workload industry think benefit acceleration and/or ai would really help business model . know , retail e-tail highly focused term recommendator recommendator engine , similar work 've seen term hyperscales . see cloud , internet company see much e-tail retail focused drawing people website , form marketing recommendator engine . 's one area focus . additionally , 've seen financial service , 've seen manufacturing , we've seen good representation folk supply management , forecasting using overall data science speed work make sure process well aligned . 'll continue adding high-level q - vivek arya - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kressworkloads , key area see people concentrating . got . colette , 'm curious enterprise even cloud customer buy accelerator , always buy next new server buy ? also also retrofit existing server deployment , right , perhaps improve application , right , addition accelerator ? always trying figure term attach rate accelerator kind limited , whatever , 12 15 million server sold every year . accelerator always sold new server ? also retrofitted existing deployment ? seeing across industry maybe two-fold . yes , significant amount cluster purchased newly , newly designed , think great thing within lot server configuration enhance workload overall , acceleration -- remember , different part . focused acceleration gpu , acceleration term networking . 've seen u focused term acceleration using dpu enhance overall experience . purchasing new cluster new modern data center important piece term expansion . additionally , see folk purchasing adding existing cluster may accelerated . already trained model . already deployed configuration acceleration , may needed add term 's something would like deploy . opportunity , know , within existing server attach put infringed product pcie slot possibility . first two probably key focus area see enterprise hyperscales . got . -- always find tough forecast growth data center business , right , long period time , 'm talking compute side . way looking many accelerator added every year , right , versus number cpu ? good way projecting growth ? yes , attach rate ? 10 % , 15 % ? -- , shoe , would project nvidia 's computing growth opportunity ? well , let 's go back remember accelerator added server system taking work single overall cpu server . would n't one-to- one comparison say one accelerator versus cpu determine overall attach rate . best really look overall tcu -- tco value providing customer , helping understand enabled streamline approach data center using acceleration ai . q - vivek arya - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kressi think best way could articulate count , measure term . think easy answer say , 're early day . 're early inning 're seeing term long-term move accelerated computing use ai almost every single workload . , consider early day ? still significant amount application software need stitched together inﬂuence workload move use accelerated overall ai . put together large list think work 've done cuda development platform , many compiler , framework well system software done add . still way go . got . , colette , last two minute , hoping could give u update arm acquisition . regulatory process ? 's level confidence closing announced acquisition ? give u update process . sure . working regulator across world . part process know well completing overall mellanox acquisition . working jurisdiction , whether u.s. , u.k. , europe , well moving china . , keep mind , detail discussion regulator generally confidential discussion . helping understand technology , learning two company . discussion right going well overall regular -- regulator . productive proceeding anticipated . milestone term completion , still expecting early part 2022 complete acquisition arm . disclosed described , colette , heard big -- know push back u.k. side , heard push back feedback perhaps potential customer , right , two company able get together ? yes , discussion customer , , keep mind , many customer arm customer . right . q - vivek arya - colette kress q - vivek arya - colette kresswe continue working great conversation , many truly understand benefit nvidia working . 's lot different communication , right , focused term needed overall regulatory process . regulatory process really providing competition really assuring customer maintain everything today , absolutely honor . got . okay . one last question , dpu , data processing unit , think measurable part business next year ? let see could answer dpu . dpu essential part consider modern data center going forward . 're probably going see three part . 're going see need , course , cpu form accelerator , gpu dpu , data processing unit , important piece , enable encryption , overall security , necessary data passing whole data center . beginning ramp second half year believe meaningful turn corner new year calendar 2022. great . thank much , colette . really appreciate 're taking time sharing insight . thanks everyone joining . please feel free write follow-up . thank much .
