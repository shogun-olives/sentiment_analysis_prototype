's interesting . think , go back , think satya talked relatively consistently . every time 've thought market size excess usually bigger topic . 's almost took every line item , literally everyone like p & l , mean literally every po , purchase order opened , every process run inside company around world . said , run effectively , eﬃciently ? answer likely yes . tool likely technology . ask somebody define big market ? answer 's big . ask , okay two -- business possible , run distributed system real-time data , enabled ai , business possible , absolutely . think 's see -- think people feel incredibly optimistic period time size market . n't think anyone feel constrained market tam . take constraint , one . 're talking customer azure , know customer thinking term sort budget come . traditionally 've seen -- 've said come server storage buying anymore , expanded software stack buying database anymore 's coming azure . 'd imagine also extends telco networking human cost administration . customer see way understand sort full value replacement come azure ? interesting . would tell , conversation start , budget come ? 'm trying dismissive budget . love budget , trust , really take great pride budgeting . customer conversation tend start , like grow faster . 'd like win . 'd like better serve customer . 'd like improve customer state . 'd like reduce churn . 'd like grow price . i'd like retain margin . mean 's cost way question raised . 's much like problem solved . problem solved , hence take language . q - keith wei - amy hoodthe implementation generally azure , dynamic oﬃce 365 security , bucket good problem . tends start . people say , okay , well , get paid ? may , point , replacement dollar moving budget priority around . may say , gosh , mean , lower churn 0.5 point , 's lot top-line growth afford cost . get room room system , feel like , n't know 've many conversation 's energy room 'm . 'm sure land somewhere , right , ultimately , 's much easier , always say find money budget , passion team around growth . find money , even 's hard . , 's -- sound like past four five year , conversation microsoft 'm assuming like contracting behind shifting technology provider strategic relationship 're forming company like albertson forward looking really drive change business . -- structure contract structure relationship today different five year ago 10 year ago microsoft technology provider ? interesting , keith . want say yes . reason say 's different , maybe materially different . 've always tried customer -- contracting reﬂect customer desire structure . said , know , see sort rhythm exploration base , get drone quarterly call , reality three-year contract , especially oﬃce side on-premise part business oﬃce 365 business . seeing think 's 're alluding maybe azure side business , contract taking different ﬂare ? try make look like old ? answer tried really hard make look like , 's right answer customer . may actually 've talked , may get big long contract , know , 'll hear u talk remaining rpo longer year , le year nature transition . , yeah , got big one commitment made upfront . maybe price reason maybe want work laid specific workload made contracting better tool maybe frankly 're really large customer prefer pega pay go , right , maybe 's preferred method . 's okay , remind people azure unique regard . right . mean got use show p & l . whether contracted 's sitting book -- sitting rpo , really really count , get deployed use loved add value , revenue . contracting language far important make sure 're getting workload deployed customer getting value far , far two year , three year , five year , seven year , two week . q - keith wei - amy hood q - keith wei - amy hood got , got . investor think azure growth equation evolving term , workload growth , -- mix sort 's workload growth , much moving sort core service like infrastructure service platform service , like database machine learning service top ? guess come back p q , q equation still go-forward basis getting higher value service becoming bigger part mix 's increasing p ? yeah , think go back tam , assume market large , n't generally feel gap . q challenge , right . q instance consumption model literally growing usage workload adoption . right . workload picked expanding think tends constraint , would , think 're asking pricing margin actually tend bigger nuance , right . 've got q growth , depend land order really gross margin look . still feel good platform . think would call core infra growth . saying seen obviously good growth data platform layer increasingly would call premium service layer . 's workload shifting , right . think q feel constrained people feel like left hand , right hand , right . take on-prem workload exist , shift like shift right . seen today , right . 's new workload , new thing frankly n't considered n't see shift spend , 's shift plus new , look quite different , . think -- see shift new , 's combination data generally core platform overtime . sometimes people ask one would bigger ? know answer . expect q grow . growth may look better data side , 's smaller relative base given transition happen , i'd think one . even getting education consumption model work , right . definitely different firm . 've gone perpetual license subscription function think 're lot learning . think think price performance . right . much price performance looking push end customer , consistently see sort increasing value platform . much sort price performance eﬃciencies 've garnered azure become better gross margin ? q - keith wei - amy hoodi 'm trying think question , 'll start . think number one , -- competitive market , price set market . n't tend think , hey , wait , eﬃciencies . 've gained sit . better way think consumption mark -- 's marketplace like way . 's competitive market lot big player competing aggressively , mean price move time new price new workload , new capability , whether 's higher differentiation tend margin others le . n't -- separately believe competitive market , spend lot time making sure fundamental terrific , mean focus cost per unit work . 've seen gross margin improvement . team done great job frankly front continues great job front . reason focus ultimately competitive market , cost price . right . want make sure continue address fundamental , great service , great quality , easy deployment , low cost , low cost deploy differentiation let leverage margin . 'll stay focused gross margin . stay focused winning . 'll stay focused taking share . 'll stay focused fact large market , think , lot good tailwind 're well positioned . sort , give take margin side , general , focus , think 's controllable . right . one last question commercial side . want touch couple consumer corporate strategy question . within server tool , that's much durable grower lot people imagined . hybrid cloud advantage great program microsoft , unlocked lot sort would say latent demand , -- cio sort customer getting locked one side equation . come point customer take advantage hybrid cloud advantage start shifting azure versus premise start become headwind ? n't know , would call happening headwind . way 've always thought hybrid program really customer need , customer need desire run workload effective place run workload want run -- frankly want run . enablement ﬂexibility call hybrid program . u , really believe , focus overall kpi even though everybody really n't want , 's 's customer purchase . want -- 'm always saying like listen , adopt ﬂexibility . q - keith wei - amy hood q - keith wei - amy hoodif n't know want move workload , n't know , committed window 're committed stipple , great ﬂexible option give customer absolute control . overtime , guess move azure , would quote unquote heavy headwind on-prem revenue . n't know world view headwind strategically . customer continuing use product service best way work . would likely show azure revenue would show on-prem revenue . n't feel badly -- n't loose lot sleep . reason see ﬂowing on-prem growth 're seeing faster shift azure , view good thing . got . moving personal computing . got . 've got three minute left , friend . mean , almost made p & l . 're going get .
