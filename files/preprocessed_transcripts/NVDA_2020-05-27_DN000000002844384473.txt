's folding high growth technology franchise larger high growth technology franchise -- right way characterize following , talk u opex , know gave number full year might little higher folk modeled . , , thought would helpful ? yeah . , 's really good question type & nvidia interested ? strategic rationale purchased overall mellanox ? 's rare would make decision based financial engineering . say , hey , number look really great , culture strong . culture extremely high quality , engineering leadership market enter . mellanox unique piece u overall acquire , one similar term best breed market overall interconnects , engineering focused , probably large startup , seemed resonate little bit company maybe 7 year 10 year ago . many likeness term culture , well focus term high-end overall engineering leadership , felt good combination . n't mean n't look think could growth together . 're right , still option u potentially partner together , great opportunity u work together build product together really take overall accelerated compute next level think acceleration focus component around central overall compute term inside data center mellanox perfect partner u . , incorporating , wanted make sure n't overlap product product , thing 've seen people indicating overlap , thing could eï¬ƒcient . certainly thing eï¬ƒcient term g & overall organization , integrate term long-term . believe , focus create product going forward ? start term engineering product partnership two thing inside box , overall build together ? 'll see year come 'll see term next quarter . , look term 've incorporated guidance , guidance full p & l , also provided full year overall opex . , full year opex gaap non-gaap , gaap incorporates overall acquisition accounting , probably favorite thing account working together team , probably several month term determining would . largest piece purchase price accounting . two piece purchase price accounting , important investor see , course , non cash point , entry opposite end cash use overall purchase overall acquisition . , overall gaap result opex , well cog , amortization two thing , amortization intangible , intangible opex , well intangible overall cog . continue many year . 'll see thing term 5 year 7 year , term amortization . matt ramsay colette kresssecondly , step-up overall inventory fair value . also find overall cog . one time nature , one time overall q2 result . thirdly , one-time item deal cost , type piece q2 opex well . lastly , continuation adding together existing stock-based compensation . mellanox overall stock-based compensation acquired share continue vast normal period time . small amount retention , well keep overall strong engineering team , essentially whole company assure meet future goal together . , breakdown overall guidance . 's good amount . one-time non cash incorporated gaap result . 'll provide understanding get end q2 see detail type accounting , good part 're seeing non- cash nature following overall rule acquisition accounting . got . make sense . kind back deal closed described mellanox revenue growth rate recently folded operating cost . big picture think growth top line nvidia growth operating expense , anything -- mean step-up line 'm 're sort growth trajectory integrated company ? right way think difference way would see business growing investment growing integrated ? yeah , 're definitely spending time right working growth across two company . 's many discussion team want engineering , 're actually spending time re-plan together . imagine mellanox , given much time taking overall close deal , continued saying , 've got run company normal . , spent last month working help understand grow together , one company . many thing several organization together eï¬ƒciently term investment , 's thing refer overall g & organization . keep mind , move process system together one company , hope integrated fully within next year , type investment see probably something cross invest , necessarily invest externally . , thing . 's course , eï¬ƒciencies g & 'll see time , feel overall integration need . matt ramsay colette kress got . since 've talking data center mellanox one question always pop think couple prominent company data center space talked maybe little bit different shape calendar 2020 -- lot work home-based type cloud spending beginning year , little bit , n't know , concern among investment community -- 's back end pull-in spending look like back half year company -- right beginning big cycle ampere , little bit cyclicality data center spending affected business last couple year . , know , think jensen 's talked couple forum since earnings would speak -- spoke public call well , -- visibility data center maybe business scale versus might couple year ago sort cycle spending think might manage coming month ? yeah . think turn corner introduce a100 time versus probably three year ago launched v100 , 's lot difference . would agree scale . scale business essential installed base well partnership . partnership hyperscalers across world , well strong piece within cloud , beginning see term enterprise workload mean . , introduced overall v100 started work overall hyperscales , 's time incorporate one important piece , called qualification period . qualification period , depending using infrastructure take time . little differently a100 . a100 whether think full software stack think different hardware component , sold overall baseboard overall agp's together . , synchronize everything hardware around , well software ease improve overall qualification time period . helpful initial customer . know worked find best overall component buy -- find best overall software run different type environment . , something 's different v100 . begun overall sampling , think overall development process , probably incorporated good point input overall hyperscales term need . a100 unique . a100 maybe would refer universal platform . geared training time . geared inferencing . matt ramsaycapability platform . also ability create multiple instance time , could choose part instance overall training , part overall inferencing many different type combination around . creating overall ï¬‚exibility really helpful people choosing overall compute workload want . want say , overall a100 , n't need determine one skus need overall purchase . , 's lot overall benefit a100 launch . , yes , demand ? demand think right covid-19 well sometimes cycle term overall procuring ? cycle pretty much statement getting overall data center ready , large purchaser , work process setting data center getting piece insert overall compute . indicated moved q1 , well move q2 , 've indicated visibility . visibility strong go q2 , 're going need little bit time think look like second half year . n't quarter q1 q2 refer poland 's . n't view poland 's associated purchase overall ampere part overall data center business . case ai hope overall strategized key type investment people make . investment hyperscales cloud , enterprise turn corner , remain competitive environment overusing ai . 've seen overall covid-19 though people turn existing compute , use overall nvidia product help solve solution , solve overall virus , whether looking certain people get overall virus versus others , also looking improve process . imagine , think storefront retail opening , want assure distancing . overall distancing within store , keeping track overall use ai . , 's tremendous opportunity unfortunate virus brings , also era think future , think stay competitive use overall ai scenario ? , thanks . think , interest time , might want jump talk gaming little bit , considering 's big part company , say team cowen done quite bit work edge cloud , think 's interesting see ampere bring inference training piece hardware virtualized think maybe save conversation oï¬ „ ine think 's lot work , quickly diving colette kressinto gaming 's push/pull covid well , ton people stuck home gaming , driving interest demand product , time 's icafe market remains really challenged asia think 's bit mixed change desktop notebook business . , best talk moving part get july quarter gaming maybe unusual year conference moved around diï¬ƒcult launch date changed around well 're thinking next couple quarter gaming moment ? let 's start term base , term saw q1 regarding gaming . announced overall guidance quarter way back valentine 's day , initial stage overall virus . point , moved pandemic really taking place asia-pac overall area . important part market though u , indicated expected impact overall gaming business . , quarter , saw . saw move overall pandemic . saw shutdown overall retail channel almost across world . additionally , overall icafes shut period time overall china . led , work home , learn home , probably one important piece , entertain gaming home say , 's nothing else , home , great opportunity use time spare time overall gaming saw consistently across world . mean term people platform , whether steam , whether gfn , thing could see people increasing time gaming , increasing number hour gaming , also increasing number people overall platform . , 're really pleased result , let 's talk saw movement retail e-tail quarter , fairly eï¬ƒciently . , could imagine overall channel thing going retail versus e-tail quite different , move quite well . , people looking form ability get gaming could purchase e-tail also saw people probably looking thing dual . game also compute mobile workstation work computer , excuse , home . saw strength overall notebook business well . , turn corner looking q2 overall guidance , 're going still , believe see solid interest overall gaming much thing around world still bit shutdown mode , slowly improving . icafes still practicing distancing well . , may open , 're necessary open 100 % . 's something took account thought overall guidance , think important thing underlying strength , even good time , probably matt ramsay colette kressthe challenging time , gaming becomes front center great overall platform overall entertain . 've increased last 5 year 10 year well , probably one economical form overall gaming something existing platform purchase , either add-in card , buy overall ( inaudible ) -- overall notebook . know , 're also overall console switch . , also helped overall need gaming challenging time . , asked term think next couple quarter . know , 're working virtually . many conference sit front little screen little video , think continue . 're getting better . 've 12 week . , think industry adapt . able launch a100 , know , jensen 's kitchen . 'm sure anybody going worry conference , think 'll still get information great game going coming . get end summer , 're going starting think back school , going starting think holiday . great time game . , game come , people also second purchase purchase overall compute , play game . , 're still excited . 's going different format term people , know present information . make sense . , yeah , think said , 're getting used new virtual world put together 're . interest time 'm getting , 's little interface right red , yellow green light . light starting beep , wanted touch brieï¬‚y automotive business . know guidance 40 % sequentially , obviously huge opportunity company next 5 , 10 year autonomous driving . think near term revenue , maybe could talk little bit level investment 're making automotive space expect sustain near term bump auto market ? sure . , remind everybody q1 result 've reported , automotive business impact due covid-19 , guide overall q2 , expect automotive business 40 % sequentially . really associated legacy infotainment system much overall automotive industry manufacturing significantly injured covid-19 also overall demand purchase overall car . continue work term long-term , overall av solution work term matt ramsayproducing overall av across spectrum way ada overall robotaxis . last several quarter , 've continued work even covid-19 arena , thinking best optimize auto motive spend building av . like idea one single end-to-end platform take ada high level type robotaxis overall self driving , reason overall testing , overall software development lot work , , well work providing individually . could standardize platform take way different piece , help , possibly faster market , also really helping overall time taking build overall platform . internally , continue work automotive company term building software platform . many case , specific agreement 're working together . , think software development , remember , universal unified architecture across company use term overall hardware . software kind added top specific industry . 's automotive . 're able really treat vertical overall investment term bringing av . got . cut conversation abruptly , think 're getting virtual hook given time together , congratulation ampere closing mellanox 'll awaiting , think would ampere launch gaming space . thanks spending bit time cowen . much appreciate thank , everybody .
