good afternoon . n't go ahead go get started ? name john pitzer . u.s. semiconductor analyst crãƒâ©dit suisse . 's pleasure afternoon introduce fireside keynote chat colette kress , evp cfo nvidia corporation . 've got 35 , 40 minute opportunity today fireside chat . opportunity q & . mic . question , please n't shy please raise hand . we'll get mic . , colette , first , thank coming . thank . appreciate support conference . absolutely . question answer sort setting , 've sort 6 ; 7-year unprecedented run semiconductor industry . guy right top unprecedented run . 'm sure 's many people room n't sort somewhat aware nvidia . always find kind nice - colette m. kressstart fireside chat helping level set everybody audience webcast . maybe spend minute talking core ip , 4 end market try exploit maybe word , help frame sort investment opportunity see nvidia audience . sure . 're startup . 're new company . 've around probably 24 year . began business focused still we're focused today . focus gpu . gpu stand graphic processing unit . found application graphic like , gaming . early day , known within pc platform known term high-end video card would enable high-end gaming . lot transformed period time particularly probably last 10 year . continue look opportunity gpu term platform , key use case , unique processor . 's probably one complex processor . give overall complexity overall ability parallel processing . overall graphic key . 's still big part business . use 2 key market platform , including gaming business , including pro visualization . pro visualization take graphic world enterprise , enterprise focus building building , focusing designing product , focusing high-end graphic necessary . looked platform n't necessarily focus graphic focused moving term compute capability compute capability every type device . key front center right device run much data center much significant amount compute world today . 've expanded term overall term compute function , compute function started term high-performance computing starting term new era 's front u , probably artificial intelligence . meeting togetherness , togetherness gpu , overall parallel significant processing power new way approach ai decade front u , new way really n't look term writing software line software line actually letting software write . put significant amount data together ( inaudible ) using overall processor process , probably infer necessary artificial intelligence . branched many year ago focus field , focus using gpu . taken u . we've defined 4 market , gaming , pro vi , data center automotive , based complexity uniqueness gpu well engineered overall successful . 4 business today . one growing overall platform . growth across 4 . 's unique position core market gaming still important growth opportunity u , allowing u investment term business building . automotive business really adjacency overall data center business taking technology , focus artificial intelligence applying future self-driving car autonomous . believe ai problem front u . 're solve using overall work done data center well . investment today , investment term building future really continuing focus gaming business , continuing q - john w illiam pitzer - colette m. kressbuild democratizing ai also focus self-driving car move forward . 's helpful setting . clearly , talk investor nvidia , interest/focus within data center growth opportunity . look data , 's tremendous . last three year , 've grown business $ 200 million year run rate something eclipsing $ 2 billion . 's tenfold increase . first question , think , lot investor struggling try answer , ultimate tam ? know earlier year analyst day , kind talked $ 30 billion tam . think consisted $ 4 billion traditional hpc , $ 11 billion training sort $ 15 billion inference . help u understand science behind number ? , 've got start somewhere . couple week ago supercompute '17 , think jensen keynote talked opportunity ai perhaps part 70 % workload going forward . , kind agree . also kind mean could much larger $ 30 billion tam . 's science behind trying size tam ? yes . 's really good question able size opportunity new era probably u 10 20 year . think we're trying accomplish ai probably feasible , 's probably right calculation look computing environment last 10 15 year indicate use gpu zero-sum game gpu benefit something lose , okay ? reality 're looking thing forming data center n't , thing transformed human manual method actually use computing use ai get done . 's number extremely large . 's actually policy actually started know term installed base backing overall size gpu could term data center . done consistently tried view say , seeing today ? seeing today term gpus entering market overall unit perspective unit perspective size everything else . much compute enabling ? much compute size gpus performance enabling ? extract forward -- extension today maybe possible term going forward ? best indication term think continuation thing seeing today . force u make assumption term continued expertise gpus improving performance , looking term much value providing enterprise , cloud service provider , continue maintain growth business also maintain continued investment back business build next set thing . 's basis $ 30 billion market . aligns also jensen 's belief term many percentage workload data center probably ai-enabled . question ca n't fill time 's going take get . q - john w illiam pitzer - colette m. kress 's helpful explanation . think kind question get , especially naysayer , gpu -- clearly dominated ai space today . architectural perspective , 's best thing world today necessarily best thing . 's clearly architectural debate what's best way ai . gpu ? fpga ? asic ? 're finally starting see venture capital money come back semi space actually start fund new startup like graphcore cerberus . help u understand think architectural debate 're clearly sort evangelist gpu . 're still sticking kind sole architecture . yes . 's couple reason term focus 's necessarily focused case focus hardware . believe gpu collection multiple asics altogether allows individual come type ai workload may consider , gpu perfectly well suited order . 're early stage want ability get moving get started quite quickly ability find within gpu every one workload may want . 're seeing 3 major source data form workload ai focused video , focusing imaging certainly focused natural language processing many different form . capability within gpu , that's great . one thing though make u quite unique many type focus area different form silicon focus term computing language , piece hardware without ability develop top . ability write instruction set n't serve vast purpose could possible . focused 10 12 year computing language cuda development language . used 650,000 developer world 10 year . 're seeing downloads cuda probably close 2 million year term current run rate . reality best-of- breed term processor accomplish . probably informative development platform unified across every single one gpus . 's available everywhere . people know use . overall goal cohesive overall ai framework , one framework . , order improve overall capability framework overall improve enhance term ai . keep consistency , 've done part democratize ai best mass , enterprise want get started n't ability time market anything specialized . get started . significant amount time saving , equates value saving , immediate . 's 're seeing right . 've seen significant evolution term infrastructure saw maybe 10 15 year ago . enterprise probably would gone self-built cluster inside one data center say , `` i'm supposed get started ai . '' right , go cloud , one favorite cloud service provider get instance using overall gpu , supporting every framework . 've enabled . within probably matter 15 minute , 're ready go . q - john w illiam pitzer - colette m. kress q - john w illiam pitzer colette , perspective get , 'm sure 've heard well , gpu seems particularly well positioned training market . inference market , tam definition larger market , perception 's good enough market . think come nvidia , think investment community perception really well hard stuff . good enough stuff , leave something else . view sort competitive position gpu imprint ? know last quarter , actually started ramp new inference product marketplace . maybe give u anecdotal evidence ramp going . sure . let 's first start back , yes , training complex horsepower needing significant amount performance overall get done . think overall inferencing market , 're talking incremental data . 've already trained initial data , 're looking incremental data 's coming need processed manner term training . lot done term edge done term data center . existing today , 're right , simplistic done n't owned gpu done different form factor market . move forward think complexity ai , inferencing also get complex . inferencing continue multiple step process . different inferencing yesterday , inferencing future probably complex . think probably one important inferencing piece go forward automotive , okay ? car going need able process road . n't ability continuously go back data center ( inaudible ) announcer . 's going pick new information along way . 've continued find right form factor , obviously , automotive also complexity supercomputer 's going necessary form inferencing . today , inferencing small portion , small portion business . probably 1,200 different company focusing using inference , also synergistics using overall training environment . also ability term u improve throughput term we're seeing new inferencing product . product pascal line , p4 p40 , well new capability term tensor core , allows multiple precision . multiple precision really say inferencing , `` quickly get answer without getting x amount digit afterwards actually infer overall answer would ? '' 've done great progress . great excitement probably come next quarter . well going back definition inference tam $ 15 billion . know 's best guess today , believe inferencing portfolio able address ? going go portion inference market , sort harder part market . leave commodity part architecture ? - colette m. kress q - john w illiam pitzer - colette m. kress q - john w illiam pitzer yes . absolutely . lot people confuse term inferencing term iot device simplistic device part overall tam . really concentrate term high-end device , stand-alone device going need significant amount inferencing . robotics overall manufacturing term edge , example probably see inferencing front center focus . mentioned tensorflow earlier . clearly , 're starting ramp new volta product . one question get asked often 've gpu- centric architecture , ( ) -only architecture . volta 's clearly significant improvement pascal family . investor kind asked . n't great answer , , extent volta better pascal 've able gpu transistor versus tensorflow ? move tensorflow sort tacit admission maybe 's all-gpu world ? moved volta architecture . currently volta 100 , actually enabled probably 10x improvement term term pascal architecture . significant improvement driven excitement demand application used service , cloud service provider internal apps . also may enable term cloud . put place tensor core , tensor core piece also allows overall inferencing capability . spent time term improving overall hardware capability also significant amount software . , company , really moved probably higher percentage software engineer hardware engineer . focus go forward continue think software layer 's enabling certain part industry , certain part workload . tensor core immediate work term 've seen last couple year u coming together think inferencing , think dual capability gpu training inferencing together . work done cuda , done cuda term library work term framework term software . although volta architectural change , architectural change allows u focus node focus also different type part design improve performance , still substantial amount software work consistently across platform hold together . maybe elaborate little bit . mentioned cuda . clearly , guy evangelizing cuda decade . 's created good moat near term . think 's skepticism sustainable moat . question would ask , first mover advantage also space ? look announcement made earlier week ge partnership health care side . increasingly domain - colette m. kress q - john w illiam pitzer - colette m. kressexpertise becomes barrier entry work customer specific industry vertical around ai ? overall development cuda , 're correct . multiple year , version 9. come consistent cadence . come new feature . come new capability . consistently working use cuda take suggestion make sure we've incorporated . think value add , one else ecosystem 're gpu ai covering . nobody covering cuda . cover cuda . enabling complete middleware focusing . think standing asset going forward . think industry specific , move industry specific , example , automotive . automotive industry specific term knowledge understanding understanding map high- definition map well going necessary get car drive . industry reinvesting back business , area think move fast , feel 's , challenging problem focus . 've enabled platform software everyone allows u ability focus specialize important market want , health care one . think health care , look manner automotive . save life , improve overall safety automotive improve solving tough problem , fit overall need company , serving community also accomplishing hard problem . given tam opportunity time , seems almost little bit silly focus much near term . 've dealt investor long enough realize focus silly stuff . called characterized transitional quarter data center july quarter , quarter introduced volta . find odd given strong year-over-year growth would call transitional . quarter grew 2 % sequentially . recent quarter , reported data center growth reaccelerated sequential basis 20 % . characterized call 're still early stage volta ramp . help u understand think kind sequential growth . given volta rollout , tailwind , increase confidence sequential growth business ? sure . launched volta , launched volta may gtc san jose . opportunity bring world tremendous overall product . launched , tremendous amount excitement around . folk could help focus 10x improvement term overall pascal . launch , knew , still process , yes , 's launched . actually get sample customer . sample actually qualify term infrastructure give good test drive . finished q2 , extremely pleased q - john w illiam pitzer - colette m. kresswith result overall company whole moved 15-day quarter quarter material amount data center business volta . mean launching sample , qualification , shipping working , met goal . 're extremely pleased . yes , 's called transition overall quarter . started beginning q3 , referred full production term volta . ready go . want everybody understand still enterprise product . enterprise product stop way home , pick one , put infrastructure next day . take anywhere couple month 18 month term qualification full term size project may working . many people , many csps around world working endorsed working term qualification volta . already term cloud running . working fast feverishly . 're full production . still way go term qualification . think nothing take away standpoint still think huge opportunity front u . 's opportunity u capture overall platform . best endorsement gpu viable architecture data center revenue growth . said , intel recently made interesting hire , bringing onboard ex-head radeon graphic business amd , , clearly , think , admission gpus taking share data center perhaps internal effort kind behind . think competitive environment , intel amd , specifically gpu architecture inside data center ? yes . think work done gpus , particularly data center , short amount piece work . 6-month cycle come back say , `` software available . we're ready go . '' even single person term . team people focused data center either focused certain framework , focused certain library , focused term cuda , seamlessly keep together major , major effort . think many year people focused good enough . continue focus better use performance coming gpu , served u quite well . think lot focus . think 's lot focus people wanting part ai . think large enough several different player . focused term quickly establish platform , enable others . enabling platform others , spending significant amount time teaching others . 've learned lot term year focusing , deep learning term , term code . gtcs , continued teach deep learning , something n't think anyone competitor really talk . looked term help u move forward . 're pleased endorsement . take seriously . think benefit u going forward . q - john w illiam pitzer - colette m. kress q - john w illiam pitzer last question data center moving gaming , know company n't necessarily focus least communicate investor community around asp dynamic . clearly , look 's happening data center business around asp , 're bringing incremental value . performance-driven asp . asp moving pretty significantly . see path continue . think one concern investor rising asp helping fuel innovation outside gpus . look google 's tpu statement 've made around 's significantly lowered cost ai . think pricing environment data center market 3 ; 5-year period ? differentiate sort deep -- training part market inference part market ? yes . think overall pricing think overall delivering , first calculation working term customer 're going save term moved ai world , significant amount infrastructure cost change gpu-enabled server replace significant amount regular cpu type server . case , 's significant saving part . 's also peripheral around term operation cost running also overall improvement term readily available information . overall thought term pricing really saving achieve term receive much significant saving well pricing really focused year development , year cuda , year design term gpus incorporated . 's kind meeting term middle . manner , term term gaming , want gamer feel every single time coming market buy new gpu , 're getting performance since last time came market dollar spend . 're consistently , mean performance , infrastructure extremely important . innovation gpus extremely important u maintain term . far , model . think term training versus inference , 2 different type thing term necessary . training going need little bit performance . little bit performance going command likely higher overall price , , based overall success enabling term improving workload . inferencing may volume type thing . probably get much different term price point term inferencing versus overall training . , 'll gear based saving ? overall tco improvement receive ? let 's segue gaming part market , actually largest single business 60 % revenue . despite attention excitement around data center , look stand-alone gaming company , 're still fastest-growing semiconductor company last 3 four year . - colette m. kress q - john w illiam pitzer - colette m. kress q - john w illiam pitzeryou 've able grow business 20 % cagr , talking incremental performance 're bringing customer every year ability pay . question think last time updated u far pascal ramp penetration analyst day said 15 % penetrated . 've 2 fairly strong gaming quarter july october quarter . talk little bit penetration today ? think sort asp uplift pascal business ? sure . think success term gaming , come 2 simplistic part say , `` must unit increase . must increase term overall asp . '' course . 's actually little bit involved term piece . one , think overall unit growth seen , unit growth really focused overall growth term market whole . gaming period time changed significantly . 's changed term sport would play computer . would play . probably mostly male-dominated . probably mostly 18 25 year old . right , gender . moved younger , probably starting teenager . 've gotten older . 're probably 40 year old older term ( inaudible ) . people room probably . 're starting younger 're staying longer term . also importantly 's social platform . 's game . 's socialization involved . staying friend . 've moved entertainment business . 've moved -- away television . moved gaming , gaming , believe , watch others game . become significant part industry . gamers . participating , every part world , every age , every gender . secondly , think overall price , large overall industry , tend try move gaming product every one , depending price point want spend . want enable . many different card , $ 100 , $ 1,000 . generally , get older , discretionary income may overall improve may able . additionally , may want right gear seen term entertainment ( ) term 're . 've able benefit higher production value game need higher gpu . 've able benefit overall entertainment . think 's important understand gaming also transitioned transformed quite bit last 10 year 've seen . - colette m. kress q - john w illiam pitzer - colette m. kress q - john w illiam pitzer - colette m. kressone theme n't bring . asked stage last year . know 's diï¬ƒcult track within gaming business . think impact ar , vr longer term onto size market ? getting better able track 's going ar , vr application versus pure gaming application ? sure . time talk 've seen right gaming , get excited 's front u . gaming still tremendously healthy type business . know focus term ar vr , make thing realistic , make even better platform going forward . 's little bit catch-22 . content important . application important . done role term serving overall innovation term enable vr . overall high- end game , focus vr player term content , term enable success term market . still believe next generation , gaming market likely enterprise well . enterprise great need using virtual reality and/or ar many different type resource . couple near-term question gaming business kind originated quarter reported . , street assumes data center continues grow sequentially . look full guidance january quarter , imply potentially gaming business , lot seasonal . help u understand dynamic switch versus pure gaming ? intent ? level conservatism ? yes . n't provide guidance business level , segment level . provided growth rate sequentially total . 's many different scenario may come . much visibility , market leadership many . goal make sure get total number right . work term different scenario . one may happen . looking back term seasonally , think seasonality seen gaming essentially h2 bigger h1 , okay ? safely say seasonality . tends -- ride lot holiday , lot buying season associated . also seems time term great game come , . 'll see pan . nothing materially thought term guidance trying make statement otherwise , , yes , 'll probably grow total sequentially . specifically switch , think product growth ? q - john w illiam pitzer - colette m. kressyes . mean , switch tremendously successful product . 're pleased partnership nintendo , success , vision , work 've jointly done together make successful product . wish best . 's nothing say term 'd see term switch going forward , work term partnership nintendo term say . , could n't pleased term success . thing think little bit different october quarter relative gaming , correct 'm wrong , think first time mentioned cryptocurrency partly driven -- 's partly driving gaming side business . look historically , 's oem business . think almost 50 % sequentially oem portion . say crypto demand made gaming . quantify ? know 's easy . guess , important longer-term question bitcoin hitting $ 11,000 earlier today , 's longevity business ? know guy conservative thinking longer term . last conference call , jensen talked perhaps -- leg sustainability think 've heard guy talk past . misinterpret ? feel ? last 2 quarter , 've relatively consistent cryptocurrency general point view . q2 started create board specifically cryptocurrency classify oem business . keep mind , mean board done compute , okay , meaning graphic capability ca n't used overall gaming . reason wanted make sure supplied overall card needed gamers , important strategic importance . however , certain time , overall availability and/or price ethereum reach high level , 's fairly good return investment buying high-end card . could good return investment say , `` could actually buy higher-end game . actually gaming mining time . '' 're correct , probably residual amount small amount term . 's something visibly see , visibly count ( inaudible ) . believe majority reside term overall crypto card , size $ 150 million q2 met expectation term q3 , thought would residual probably closer ( inaudible ) . tail right term current cryptocurrencies see . 've probably reached term peak past . n't mean go away . another way looking unique market dynamic . desire cryptocurrency . whether people agree exist ( inaudible ) desire . ability serve market . create gpu quite easily market . work well u . we'll participate easy . n't think believe tail full market rather tendency . 'll see go , meaning may last currency see . q - john w illiam pitzer - colette m. kress q - john w illiam pitzer colette , last question focus auto business . look , think last quarter slowest year-over-year growth , still strong year-over-year , yes . slowest 've seen . know 's business 's little bit transformation focused mainly infotainment side business . know 've sort redirected head count r & resource focus advanced ada , level 3 , level 4 , level 5 , huge market opportunity . get asked time time though , think bridge infotainment business today advanced data 3 , 4 5 really begin take , concerned revenue weakness ? think 've kind planned revenue growth business appropriately ? yes . let kind expand . automotive industry 10 year term focus . think give u tremendous credibility understanding term business work . entered market focused infotainment system . infotainment system time came term premium line car premium infotainment system . concentrate . probably see evolution say 'll move touch screen right term premium , probably ai-enabled well , meaning may bring voice recognition quite bit term infotainment . 's area would like part well . n't mean would focus term mass market infotainment think see right , infotainment car probably reached commodity , 're available . therefore , 're really use technology resource mass market . usually stay visual computing piece extremely important and/or add , term ai . term transition focus autonomous driving . harder problem infotainment , taking significant amount resource significant amount time also automotive company . 've honed though time frame think ready go term keeping balance term everybody else . 're probably looking 2020 2021 , available production . mean full ï¬‚eet . probably mean set part term ï¬‚eet mean term overall pilot . , continued work . work may evolve term development service . may involve thing . may involve term releasing piloted development platform . 's 'll . believe infotainment system probably consistent overall automotive industry whole . 'll think overall development platform top get actual platform inside car 2020 , 2021. fantastic . think 've run time session . really want thank colette everyone joining afternoon . helpful . thank much . - colette m. kress great . thank .
