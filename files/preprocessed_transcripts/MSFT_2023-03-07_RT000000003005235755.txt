excellent . thank , everyone joining u . name keith wei . run u.s. software research effort morgan stanley . 'm really pleased u microsoft , scott guthrie , executive vice president cloud ai . think 's couple thing behind , wide scope responsibility . really super interesting conversation ahead given everything 's going microsoft . get , something uninteresting , disclosure statement . important disclosure , please see morgan stanley research disclosure website www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures . question , please reach morgan stanley 's sale representative . question answer ( question answer ) excellent . thank much joining u . think fascinating time talking given sort everything 's going within sort microsoft ecosystem . think start everyone 's kind super excited . -- investor standpoint especially people paying close attention , pace innovation 're seeing term ai generative ai capability coming solution portfolio really impressed people impressed upside kind expectation . talk u came together ? something n't sort come forefront last month two . something - scott guthrie q - keith wei - scott guthrieyou guy putting together year . talk u sort guy built ai capability within microsoft ? we're seeing expressed across product division ? yes . mean , think 's exciting time . mean , think sort call age ai 're entering 's probably going significant technology transformation lifetime , 've experienced lot big one . think -- 's going next couple year , 's statement around next quarter two . think , profound really going change business work , society work going forward , 's kind amazing technology side . mean , bet 've made going back many year deep partnership openai team , know sam going event think later week . 's great partnership kind made mutual bet building kind call ai supercomputer , kind service inside azure provide , really optimized around , large language model training . kind jointly whole bunch architecture work , kind designing , going build model , going build infrastructure , really build something pretty special allows large language model trained fast iteratively . kudos openai team . really pioneered tremendous amount kind new way thinking building model combination think really magic last six month . think road ahead going pretty exciting start move training model , providing model really embedding every single app experience . even microsoft , 've seen , even week , yesterday , announced dynamic 365 copilot power platform copilot . shipped github copilot last year 're going see u kind infuse ai deeply throughout application . 's think going great customer really next foundation computing . right . think kind structurally within microsoft , 's openai partnership , guy lot kind ai research in-house . acquired interesting technology nuance sort dax platform . understand , 's centralized kind ai kind core functionality 's product team figure sort expose solution . correct way think ? little bit . yes , mean , 's core kind call ai platform 're building . q - keith wei - scott guthrie q - keith wei - scott guthrie right . 's platform offer external customer partner . nice thing , oﬃce 365 nuance , dynamic , github using platform infrastructure capability external partner customer leverage well , 've kind believed first-party third- party symmetry important . 's lot share . part opportunity large language model ability kind know lot stuff lot thing able use -- used lot different domain . 've built azure openai service example ability organization internal team kind provide fine tuning model specific use case make even better . promise able leverage large language model , training public web , ability say morgan stanley another customer able take proprietary data tune even know , model going used , u . 's going benefit anyone else , 're going control access , 're going business model around , think enterprise customer particular looking . saas isvs startup going serve customer going need . think , n't want claim 's perfect , think 've got something special . fact 're able use first-party product we're able offer customer partner , think speaks opportunity year ahead . right . 's important side equation . 're talking , like large enterprise particularly sort regulated industry , bring sort like security sort data residency side equation . also ai , , get smarter particular business process , 's meant solve -- , answer question specific business ? yes . mean , ai learns data one thing need think ai , provide data model learns , owns model , owns data . 's , trust important , think ai age . promise , data data , 's data . get monetize , get control foundation model wo n't learn data . instance learns , model shared others . q - keith wei - scott guthriei think promise , frankly trust 've earned year microsoft earn trust drip lose bucket . 's really important focus trust . think put u good position , think , think people look u versus maybe big tech company say , `` yes , feel like , trust microsoft '' think hopefully make u good steward year ahead people look u trusted partner 's going help fully leverage ai maximum potential . got . one reason excited talk point time , think 's really kind foundational question investor asking underlying technology . one biggest one kind , think competition ? think 's going make one model better ? let ask question like think judging whether gpt model openai better google 's bringing equation amazon bringing equation . going parameter competition ? think 's going two aspect . mean , one going raw technical capability model . obviously , 're going focused making sure base model , get-go super competitive think whole world probably n't know large language model small part world knew large language model year ago . think chatgpt , thing 've done bing , github copilot like suddenly world 's woken , wow , pretty amazing stuff . we're going continue see large language innovation -- model innovation year ahead . think thing think differentiation point also going signal use case people actually using . look github copilot first really widely used large language model service world , look accuracy code generated last july versus today , 's dramatically better today 's people using , model getting better , accuracy getting better . sometimes first time market first market signal improvement really start differentiate model beyond even base capability . think 's partly 're seeing u move quickly whether 's github , whether 's microsoft 365 , whether 's dynamic , whether power platform , nuance , et cetera , 's literally nothing portfolio we're aggressively looking leverage ai , partly also want get signal going . hundred million commercial customer using product , 's lot good signal , 's going improve , think going differentiate model versus others hopefully market . q - keith wei - scott guthrie q - keith wei - scott guthrie got . 's good segue conversation bing new edge browser . one side equation , think bing announcement capability impressed lot people . really great marketing event microsoft bringing sort entire world , , like capability exist exist within -- microsoft . 's quickly blowback sort , well , answer n't right , right ? sydney emerged kind weekend kind freaked people . sound like 's part learning process , 's part making model better , get usage . yes . think , day announced new bing , one thing clear , going evolution 're going learn evolve wo n't get everything right 're going keep improving we're going really fast . 's model -- , approach team taken bing side . think 've done good job reacting fast case , people 200 prompt try cause model say something strange . credit team , 're reacting fast take seriously term making sure ai responsible , 's safe . 's kind core dna 's partly 's available everyone yet . start cohort user , learn , improve , 're going make sure deliver technology really safe responsible way . got . term sort monetization avenue go-forward basis , think one competitive advantage seems like microsoft avenue sort bring , could productize . bing one , like saying , like github developer platform another one , team premium . one n't heard yet oﬃce , overall productivity suite , guess 's come , 's march 16th event . fair say 's kind similar -- kind perspective one thing interesting kind innovation 've putting , price point behind , like n't sort innovation overall kind software moving forward , team premium sku , like expectation 's going route forward across entire portfolio ? think 're going see -- mean , guess , way look would , productivity win 're giving business , whether 's around making employee productive making specific business process effective . take example say github copilot , since 's product that's q - keith wei - scott guthriega today . 're seeing developer using github copilot 55 % productive task 's sort measured independent study 40 % code 're checking ai generated unmodified . talk cio cto , soft say give 55 % developer overnight , would take ? 're looking talent , 're constrained term number engineer hire . 're gladly going pay . good price point think , sort no- brainer pay 's great service great business . think 's going lot opportunity look ai , going additive . 're sort adding new scenario taking cost enabling organization move faster enabling productive . think margin perspective revenue perspective , price point , think thing going additive overall business . lot case , use case , cost lot money organization . think nuance healthcare , physician physician visit , physician see many patient day , help see significantly patient better experience worth lot . similarly , take call center customer support , deﬂect case without even human answer , 've happier customer 've taken lot cost system . think thing different way monetize , world 're sort delivering massive productivity win , good news 's lot customer want pay ultimately take overall cost . think 'll different opportunity u add additional value going forward . got . outstanding . today 're seeing lot functionality exposed kind existing application . go-forward basis , think change paradigm people build application ? could potentially shift pendulum see sort buy versus build application towards build side equation ? yes . think 's going -- think short run , think fastest way get ai value going finished apps , like copilot experience 're launching people already trained apps augments apps , integrates , let move faster . think 's huge opportunity . think 're also going see next generation apps going built raw apis service around , going re- envision pretty much every experience see . 've told story time e-commerce . kind take granted go web browser e- commerce site , 's category left , click ; product , click , q - keith wei - scott guthrieyou read review , price point , stock , add cart check . kind codified 30 year ago n't changed dramatically . think 're going place probably two holiday season instead browsing , 'm probably going text box 'm going say , want buy gift family member , 's price point . want delivered december 19th , like . 's going find product , 's going different user experience . 's going different question-and-answer experience . 'm going able ask question product versus scroll hundred comment review . think every organization need start thinking , okay , reinvent , retail , wealth management , manufacturing , routing , customer support . think -- 's going built , people going build . think big brand going need control . lot 's going component , compose together ? think part 're trying microsoft cloud , also able point fact built github copilot 're building team premium , 're building dynamic , use exact apis . give u opportunity also talk credibly software vendor enterprise thing . think 's big opportunity . great . one presumption made earlier question chatgpt bing announcement succinctly great marketing event microsoft . correct ? spurred customer conversation guy ? maybe broadly , term customer conversation around generative ai model ai broadly ? like far opportunity think ? think , 're still early inning . mean , think thing 's great , think , chatgpt also bing fact like end user . number people 've talked maybe n't used new product tech company , seem tried two , said , hey , we're using , child using homework , 's supposed we're using variety use case kind hear interesting one . think 's actually made technical concept , large foundational ai model , transformer-based learning . 's like people n't know world even meant 12 month ago yet hundred million people heard chatgpt bing , tried . think 's -- think actually making much real , giving u opportunity say , hey , let 's show use customer support , let 's show use developer productivity , let 's show use sale q - keith wei - scott guthrieproductivity , 's good conversation starter . , think people looking solution integrate workﬂows already help kind accelerate even . got . one thing investor struggling little bit , seems like massive opportunity ahead microsoft 's something satya talked , mean , 's expanding sort percentage gdp 5 % 10 % next 10 year kind way lay market opportunity . near term , 're talking cloud optimization . near term , we're seeing sort azure growth decelerate . like -- could give u -- well , one , give u kind perspective kind cloud optimization mean ? like customer ? changing view want use cloud fundamentally , short-term tactical impact 's sort getting line budget ? well , think , cloud optimization sort core part cloud journey 10-plus year . n't think 's necessarily new per se . mean , general , typical pattern 've seen going back many year either migrate workload cloud build new workload cloud , optimize . reinvest saving rinse repeat next workload next use case . like optimization process . mean , think -- dedicated team microsoft help customer know earns loyalty , know earns confidence move , end day , help client customer partner get investment , kind know 'll spend u 'll invest digital technology increase overall size pie . general like type optimization people . sometimes 're first moving , large test environment kind like , okay , kind test production , shrink test environment little bit take advantage thing like reserved instance new cost saving plan azure get better commit longer term benefit reduce per-unit cost little bit ongoing basis . 's sometimes kind right size vms right size database . 's natural . 's much optimization 're done . people optimizing , 's like 're going optimize zero . point get done go next workload . 's happened last six month nine month macro situation uncertain , people , 'd say , optimizing even , q - keith wei - scott guthrie q - keith wei - scott guthriethey sometimes holding saving little bit longer reinvest . n't heard really customer long-term change term cloud . 's always work load , 's always use case , 've talking ai , 're constantly reinventing digital technology , 're going severe competitive pressure . n't much worry long term , lead obviously shorter-term question term optimization journey exactly impact , longer term , 'm hearing change . right . concept like , optimization take place long . kind -- satya talking , say , think optimization activity last year , 's unlikely go significantly beyond ? well , think 're trying little careful term giving guidance specific quarter annualized basis . 'm -- 'm trying say , think reality 'll see , think point optimize specific workload , ca n't optimize anymore . finite amount workload basis . 's , , ultimately feel good term long term cloud n't see kind strategic shift client making . 's case -- going time dampening effect shorter term , , optimize , value get , generally long term want invest u . , look ai look new use case coming hear lot excitement around people saying , `` yes , got ultimately . '' think reinvestment saving doubt . 's -- obviously , 're wondering exactly win quarter-by-quarter basis , , confidence long term . got . want ask question azure gross margin , 's kind like roundabout question . guy bing announcement , satya pretty sort directly went sort kind gross margin key competitor term google , saying going lower gross margin business 're willing spend . n't take long investor say , well , lower gross margin search , 's going lower gross margin azure cloud business , roll ai functionality beneath platform . case like computationally intensive , bring gpus training going compressive impact overall cloud gross margin microsoft ? q - keith wei - scott guthriei think overall , mean , thing would probably point going fact new workload fact really open top line revenue . , lot use case take developer , make developer 55 % productive . got believe 's lot gross margin , ultimately translates real opportunity transform organization get productivity employee . think 're going see depending use case ai different way 'll monetize different margin structure . ultimately look keep growing productivity dramatically business probably going definitely long-term opportunity tam revenue perspective , think going allow u maintain good margin . obviously , continue evolve quarter year ahead people take maximum advantage . think thing ai 're thinking , ai gravity . meaning , ca n't go faster speed light . 've got application database 've got ai model , apart , slower network path call . lot use case , take something like github copilot , 's like 're making one ai inference , like we're every keystroke apart , slower experience . think 're also going see look ai opportunity azure specifically 's direct azure ai model opportunity , 's also fact people going increasingly want move apps database azure close large model . 's also going opportunity u sell ai , also sell vms , storage , database , everything . think also see real opportunity customer today , also , 's lot customer n't today . take particular zip code , strongest much open source-based developer azure microsoft 's historical strength . creating conversation people like , look , want take advantage large language model like want talk could use need first show value model , need first show capability azure . think going great door opener lot customer n't really given u hard look yet historically n't -- already cloud . fact openai model run exclusively azure , think ultimately going big differentiator u . got . sort pricing volume make kind higher compute intensity needed type process ? 're continuing sort really optimize model . think lot people surprised last week openai lowered price factor 10 , q - keith wei - scott guthriethat 's partly found way lower cost inferencing correspondingly say , get lot revenue , open lot opportunity 's effective , model 's cost optimized exist 30 day ago . 're still early inning 's still lot optimization learning 're . 's going fairly dynamic , think going exciting , really , , looking chatgpt use case people posted bing use case people posted , 're already using fascinating way none u , think would thought year ago . think 're going see far use case next year . right . optimization activity talking bringing inference cost . assume 's really kind getting started right . 's motion , 's muscle memory microsoft . mean , guy driving cloud gross margin azure gross margin pretty materially past couple year . one question get investor , fact guy n't gpu design , inhibit sort far go sort optimization curve . google gpus amazon design gpus . microsoft n't . significant inhibitor term eﬃcient get ? well , general , mean , think 're looking optimize everything , whether 's silicon gpus , whether 's network interconnects , whether data center design , whether 's server hardware , whether 's fiber . thing 're organically , acquisition 've done last six month hollowcore fiber company called lumenisity fungible storage i/o optimization dsps . specific scenario maybe five year ago , would made sense u investing . scale 're operating , make lot sense invest 're going continue see u innovate organically inorganically kind optimize every layer stack . part reason openai , look lot large language model startup , using azure , pretty differentiated hardware ai supercomputer includes silicon hardware network , power data center whole bunch design element 're going continue see u innovate . 're going looking opportunity every layer stack optimization . think partnership openai , fact 're building apps deeply taking advantage model also giving u real signal optimization really going matter , continue bleeding edge optimization . think signal u helped lot term 've built . would n't built way built without partnership without early application . think q - keith wei - scott guthrieultimately hopefully going help platform layer app layer , give u good differentiation year ahead . outstanding . unfortunately , take u end allotted time . could conversation day long , thank much , scott joining u . great conversation . thanks . thanks , everyone .
