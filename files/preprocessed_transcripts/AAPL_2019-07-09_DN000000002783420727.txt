're holding content populate branded direct-to-consumer service . creates different choice environment consumer , offer new way access favorite content , also complicates -- pointed earlier well , also complicates budgeting ( inaudible ) video service . become complicated , quickly one get , one three , four , five different service . question , d2c play long-term impact pay tv business model ? well , reason disney others choosing launch service , indicated prior slide , condition right , timing right closely -- folk closely watching success , early success hbo , approximately 5 million subscriber cbs access showtime , combined approximately 5 million subscriber -- pardon , got 8 million subscriber reported 2018. 're -- 's interesting part , seems bit pie sky , -- internal estimate suggesting 25 million 2022. 's -- -- publicly released information . expectation . that's astounding forecast call -- term number subscriber actually number subscription , number subscriber , around 45 million 50 million 2023. cbs 's estimate correct , could make -- half subscriber would using cbs access showtime . find somewhat untenable , , , rapid growth service surprising folk . disney+ expectation , 've probably seen multiple firm , -- internal research , say clear voice -- service tested positively hypothetical service 've ever tested tdg 's history . number consumer interested paying $ 6.99 month particular content combination astounding . 're expecting 60 million 90 million subscriber 2024 , two-thirds international viewer . word , domestic sub range 20 million 60 million number 2024. , 's lot gray 20 million 60 million . given enthusiasm observed may survey new offering , 's -- n't seeing reason disney ca n't many 20 million sub 2021. -- think service move fast . major network , , 're holding content , pulling back high value -- eight top 10 viewed show netﬂix owned third party studio third party network launching d2c service . n't surprised see oﬃce disappear nbc get along d2c effort , important show disappear menu -- 's another story , 're talking netﬂix 's future deal fact lot high value third party content leading populate service . , 's important talk pay tv 3.0 , want make sure everyone familiar technical legal fcc definition multi-video program distributor , call mvpd . originally defined , wo n't read entire definition , want focus last part . 's program -- 's distributor make available purchase subscriber customer multiple channel video programming . , channel traditionally understood signaling path provided cable television system . , emergence virtual mvpds , conception broadened include internet delivery , essentially reversed many year case law required mvpd control entire distribution infrastructure back network cpe . illustrated pay tv 1.0 previous chart , 's end-to-end service provided challenged rise virtual . 'm going wait around fcc decides update definition mvpd suit purpose . think technology business model evolving pace fcc lagging respect ultimately becomes -- 's truly relevant whether fcc agrees call pay tv 3.0 indeed mvpd . 's important . 's important 'm able advise client future look like future look like like type chart . pay tv 3.0 , 'm talking d2c aggregator , amazon channel , roku channel , apple tv , ecosystem hulu building , includes virtual pay tv service , also includes aggregation curation d2c apps . see , 've got four element chain connected model , want clarify red box around couple , 're clear concept mean . d2c aggregator -- aggregator necessarily populate service -- curated app store , , contain proprietary content , example prime channel n't amazon channel content collection . 's available prime video subscriber prime member , easily dovetail content type d2c channel wished . still serve aggregator , 's doubt . term distribution , -- aggregator distribute content , provide gateway interact app . app company owns app charge distribution guaranteeing quality experience . consumption ultimately , 's still byod model , interestingly enough , many d2c aggregator significant play cpe realm . amazon fire tv , roku roku streaming box , et cetera . create virtual integration , imagine creating content aggregating , distributing content certainly facilitating distribution content branded portal end user could -- many case , device -- branded device consumer household . 's different play four key element pay tv operator , little variance along way , end user , result integrated service act much like pay tv service . type provider , aggregate wide variety third party apps , facilitate purchase streaming channel . 'll call apps hbo app , 's important start using word channel branded content studio 's -- app virtual -- virtual channel , . single branded portal , , often paired branded hardware top . provide one-stop-shop premium channel , hbos world d2c apps . 's curated marketplace . importantly , integrate billing , access content search gateway . provides much set-top box type experience . pull amazon channel app , surf around channel , add one quickly , drop one quickly . -- call toggling , new phenomenon we're observing 're launching study next two month . switch back forth channel within payment ecosystem . amazon credit card , could quickly add without set new credential quickly cancel without worry -- without worry billing relationship , say , hbo , talk directly amazon make sure 're properly billed 're getting access need . 's portal 's similar guide -- -- one would argue 's even easier use guide pay tv system . 's virtual interface becomes entry point -- become entry point lot people watching streaming tv instead traditional live linear tv . well , primarily -- primarily on-demand service , 're seeing increasing amount live content , especially sport come portal via major league service well espn+ , 'll see dasan [ ph ] entering app store well . 's mix on-demand live channel expect 'll see live sport especially coming direct-to-consumer space . , give idea brand power folk involved we've already touched roku little bit , let 's start amazon . 55 % adult broadband user report using amazon prime , 38 % watching prime video 's prime channel resides . right , see amazon -- amazon channel responsible somewhere 30 % 35 % direct-to-consumer app purchase . 's powerful store . , observed something similar late 2017 early 2018 initial d2c research dominance amazon channel striking . said u others , said early 2018 , others join model particularly pointed roku apple candidate . fact transpired . roku recently reported 27 million active user , 40 % 12 month . importantly , 're also strongly considering producing original . remember talking d2c analyst early last year . said need keep eye roku 're likely get original content . dismissed idea , said , , 're going stay model 've got playing original . well , earlier year late last year started hearing rumor roku getting original business . , they're certainly considering . jump apple tv moment , 's reason know little service see go store open gateway . 's much -- 's modeled much like amazon channel roku . 's curated app store , hulu really interesting . saved last recently reported 28 million user . 's 3 million five -- basically four month end last year may 1st . 's astounding . 've got 2 -- 've grown 2 million sub early may hulu live tv service . 's -- 're creating curated app store within hulu environment . make particular model dangerous pay tv player general 3.0 player offer pay tv 2.0 service virtual pay tv service combination on-demand service ad on-demand service without ad . combination four different element . hulu 's job -- hulu 's goal make easy hulu user switch different service based need . example , want watch nfl season , go subscribe certain service month , watch bunch nfl game , discontinue service switch maybe on-demand service . ﬂip back forth apps service great ease . 're trying create ecosystem combine pay tv 2.0 entry point together , user n't leave hulu ecosystem customize service particular need particular time . 's strong model . , -- one key driver observation -- prediction rise pay tv 3.0 amount research continue subject , one fascinating question ask tested -- told consumer 've got -- imagine 20 channel 've listed choose five channel populate tv service , five want included list ( inaudible ) apps like netﬂix premium channel like hbo well family network like nbc ( inaudible ) et cetera define channel involved . big surprise , netﬂix topped list popular channel service , disney finished second . asked -- actually asked -- asked folk five service 'd like new service , follow question would prefer single operator single service aggregate unified interface , 've got unified search , unified billing , prefer use individual apps optimized certain viewer , like hbo specific app , want relationship hbo . well , 55 % respondent said universal across adult broadband user , 55 % said prefer single app aggregate network together provides single interface search . , 22 % preference , 22 % said preferred separate apps . future pay tv look little bit like past pay tv aggregate -- role aggregator going disappear . fact , mentioned earlier , get certain point 's diminishing return four five separate apps . expensive , 's diﬃcult navigate , diﬃcult search across find type content want . even though 're splintering individual d2c apps , expect aggregator begin offer 're going call bundle package , bundle individual apps . , example , might tier three tier service , might say x $ 30 month , let 's say sake argument , get one premium app would premium channel listing hbo , showtime , cinemax , et cetera -- could also get three mid tier channel could get five low tier channel bundle together give discount multi-app purchase . , happens , 's going take cost factor -- cost element consideration whether many apps . first notion , well , yes , many apps 'm paying much . might well get pay tv service . well , addressed sort bundling would real skinny bundle , make-believe skinny bundle advanced virtual provider ultimately cost increased extent 're much le expensive full legacy offering . type offering could legitimate skinny bundle , -- may eight 10 channel , 're exactly channel want . buy individually bundle . bundle make lot sense start talking four five different apps . striking research 've done subject led u believe model believe especially amazon roku , looking closely model right , aggregate apps present form paid -- form pay tv bundle multi-app subscriber . future virtual -- future streaming , future tv app , future - geetha ranganathan - michael greeson - geetha ranganathan - michael greeson - geetha ranganathan - michael greesonof aggregator new universe , new pay tv 3.0 universe , quite solid believe large -- lot large tech medium company one provide gateway -- introduce new model . 's right , 'll turn back geetha . question answer thank much , michael . absolutely fascinating . concludes prepared remark section switch q & . give u moment . okay . first question michael , think cable network aﬃliate fee ? via aggregation , see going coming year ? 's good question . think 'll continue go 's 's much pressure model right generate revenue margin razor thin . 'll look -- look additional fee way make revenue . think , geetha ? 've actually seen -- mean , gone day 9 % , 10 % increase aﬃliate fee . 've kind seen settle like low mid single- digit . obviously , vmvpds like mentioned michael kind helped stabilize quite bit . think content owner go d2c , 'm sure going go substantially , think . best -- best case scenario content owner , big medium company 're going try maintain probably like low single-digit growth probably , 's going really interesting , especially whole d2c revolution . agree . 's -- , 's competitive pressure rise -- increase rate quickly fear spurring -- encouraging -- fueling d2c fire . certainly n't see growing . low single-digit increase make sense , given context . next question . using analogy internet usage , view video aggregator like portal i.e. , netscape search engine i.e. , google ? , . 'll integrate search discovery recommendation across multiple apps . , 're mature . course , n't - geetha ranganathan - michael greeson - woo jin hoof offering plate right . looking toward meta , looking next several year thing likely evolve . get point offer service , one key benefit integration search , discovery recommendation across one 's apps . think incorporate search serve portal gateway . 's either . think . next question . software solution bundle , n't become like browser , commodity product ? 's , interesting point . yes , extent ip 's owned individual company , roku owns ip design interface see fit . amazon get point well . still -- develop interface service wo n't -- could say -- could argue would commoditized , many player . -- n't mean 's going million similar product thousand similar product , aggregator interface operate similarly may even look similar . want infer 's somehow commoditized . -- yeah , 's tough word use context . similar feature functionality , 's doubt gateway try outdo competitor feature gateway , ease use , different option available , power search engine , power recommendation engine , et cetera . 's commoditized -- potential become commoditized extent share common feature set within individual gateway imagine company [ ph ] small fortune make sure gateway , interface , portal optimized value add differentiation point competitor . woo jin ho . chime . depends form factor consumption . think mobility instance , could potentially commoditized browser-based , roku accessed via web browser . look -- lot consumption coming , 're still seeing fair amount consumption coming tv , either via roku stick amazon fire stick apple tv stick . ca n't carry around tv along 're one four platform use united state , amazon , roku , apple -- even android tv . win ( technical diﬃculty ) one four platform tv set-top box , could potentially win smaller form factor side well . commodity product definition ? potentially yes . level deployment right , . thing , think michael pointed elegantly , 's lot bigger underlying technology 's helping -- assisting aggregation . 's , number one , aggregation different content , also billing . there's lot back-end integration need done provider , know -- another third party may willing . google wherewithal - geetha ranganathan - michael greeson - geetha ranganathan - michael greesondo , amazon wherewithal , apple wherewithal little roku lot technology , -- focus one bit tv aggregation billing available . , 'm hesitant say 's going become commoditized least intermediate-term . okay . next question . amazon [ ph ] going able make billion dollar advertising , content imdb , n't put conﬂict service ? think lost michael . 's another question comcast . comcast explicitly say , 's aiming position xfinity service program aggregator similar amazon roku . see comcast opportunity , challenge ? yeah . really interesting question . comcast recently introduced product called flex , charging $ 5 month working app aggregator . think 're really trying kind -- 've already made shift , pivot connectivity . 's really thrust . think flex really clever way get people back ecosystem . think ultimately comcast realizing obviously main product focus next year going broadband try get people stream take higher tier , basically consume data higher price tier . think 's definitely big opportunity . course , bigger challenge obviously precipitating cord cutting 're obviously trying careful . 's going interesting see happens launch nbc service 2020 -- , tread , carefully exposed side . think right , look like pretty good strategy . michael , question . one question amazon . amazon going able make billion dollar advertising content , put conﬂict service ? 's -- 's old expression , fox guarding hen house . yes . everybody competition everybody level consolidation 's going . sure , course . course , 'll competition . 's inherent tension -- vertical horizontal consolidation , 're bound compete yesterday 's partner today 's partner tomorrow 's competitor . absolutely . okay . know spoke little bit sport zone [ ph ] . question regional sport network . view regional sport network ? fit pay tv 3.0 ecosystem ? - woo jin ho - michael greesonjust app , would assume , d2c app like many rsns many set college league , et cetera , would include conversation . linear channel , apps . premium fee-based app , -- -- would included option . , sure given sport , 's limitation -- -- owns right -- right windowed limited . certainly inherent issue -- role play , think extent league continue grow d2c traﬃc like 're , 's reason regional sport network also involved . , 'm acknowledging negotiation get right , introduce service may problematic . 's area expertise . 's reason -- 's prima facie reason could n't -- n't think developing apps including apps type portal type curated aggregator store . reason think would n't included . , think 's play , question , whether generate suﬃcient revenue type relationship . michael question . talking content creator move d2c , platform vendor going beneficiary . know focus like top 10 plus sport content creator , like -- content aggregrators , let 's say , netﬂix , hbo disney . hundred smaller content creator subscription basis ? mean , 's got much room content acquisition consumer . mean , guy ? stay subscription based model think 'll cut -- look mirror say maybe switch ad based model ? think play long-term ? think 's great question . think really depends brand network , channel 're talking . really interesting report , probably decade ago . wrote report small channel age streaming . far ahead curve . author colin dixon , many call know . lead analyst tdg back . analyzed amc network going d2c u -- let 's see , u -- usa network outdoor channel . conclusion exercise -- 's strong niche like outdoor channel , might quite -- may really well . , 're competing offering -- wo n't bring enough revenue relative could brought part pay tv package . large network like usa , reach substantial power substantial . could d2c offering probably pretty well . got scale , could well . 're smaller 've got really legitimate niche , linear viewer truly dedicated content 's part lifestyle like outdoor channel would maybe hunter fisher -- fisherman , might stand chance fee based subscription level . would argue first play would -- small channel would probably go fee based one portal wait free ad based service . - geetha ranganathani see free ad based service -- know 're -- rage right that's largely driven success svad avad [ ph ] aggregator , like pluto tv xumo tubi . 're one pulling million million user , individual -- let back . want take -- let 's take fubotv example . , 've able grow subscriber base quickly that's disappointing 've got really solid offering , especially like sport , launched free ad based streaming service 're creating content . another example someone -- traditionally model n't create content . pay tv operator , 've got creating content . 've launched service . -- , -- heard going launch ( inaudible ) tell poorly paid subscription . last resort offering 're spinning marketing help ( inaudible ) content necessarily best content . give away free , ultimately grow subscriber base . 's end , 's mean end growing subscriber . think dual approach , let 's move away pay tv operator individual channel , think dual approach could helpful . think 're going see lot people starting fee based , adding ad based even fewer reverse . ad based 're well , 's silly add fee based . mean , 've proven 're going market . -- see dual approach . see individual app , much like hulu . pay x ad free , pay put ad . think dual approach likely smaller channel . think 's critical play - - 're going play d2c game 've got get portal , mentioned earlier -- imaginary model fictional model made , buy one premium service , three mid tier service five low tier service , want make sure brand one tier . hunter go , optimize package , better find outdoor channel 's watch regular tv . ca n't get , value service significantly diminished niche filled . supposed customizable tv service , theory . big brush stroke . yeah . -- got . okay . thanks , michael . actually time . thank joining u today . question , please feel free reach directly one u . email listed slide 26. thank michael fantastic discussion thank .
