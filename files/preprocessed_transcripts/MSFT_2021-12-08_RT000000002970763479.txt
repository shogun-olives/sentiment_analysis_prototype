well , thank everybody joining day three three-day ubs tech conference . 'm probably excited lineup software company day three microsoft obviously , 've mongodb , zoom , informatica datastax docusign afternoon , really high quality lineup software company . would say led relatively large market cap company seattle area . corey , thanks joining u . everybody listening , question , 'd like ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) direct corey . question bar front , 're welcome use 'll see . 'd prefer reach directly email 'll curate pepper corey investor question towards end . corey , welcome . maybe want take minute describe role microsoft n't met yet . yeah , absolutely . thanks karl thank much . 'll explain action , current role , also maybe explain previous role give little bit framing , actually changed role last couple week . current role team called microsoft cloud industry global expansion team , engineering side , report scott guthrie , i'm accountable sort delivery industry solution , partnership global expansion deployment around world . , 's , like said , 've enrolled couple week . , 'll answer best regard . previous three year , reported judson althoff , who's chief commercial oï¬ƒcer -- chief revenue oï¬ƒcer , excuse , responsible sort go-to-market strategy technical delivery solution area azure dynamic , good sort amount experience area . prior , actually engineering q - karl keirstead - corey sander q - karl keirstead - corey sander q - karl keirstead - corey sanderswell building original azure vm compute stack . little bit place microsoft excited . question answer ( question answer ) make interesting everybody , corey . yes , exactly maybe interesting . obviously everybody scott 's team need session red polo . 'm glad 've got exception . 's right . 'm actually n't think 're allowed wear red polo . 's confusing , anyone scott wear red polo , 's banned . right . corey , maybe dive azure individual product area microsoft , let 's kind keep little higher level little bit ask broadly , 're seeing spending environment . sort spirit question something , tech investor trying grapple especially year-end look new year pick right stock understand trend might terrific last 18 month post covid , maybe mix shifting priority changing next 18 month 's obviously important everybody get right stock portfolio . maybe 'll start , think spending priority changing ? yeah . think 've seen last month , maybe even year , particularly accelerated unfortunate output pandemic . 've seen big focus push towards digital transformation every front , right , think particular focus cloud enable type digital transformation . includes certainly productivity change productivity sort conversation right remember done three year ago everyone conference room . , change sort approach productivity engage work , inside outside company fundamentally changed fundamental dependency cloud . q - karl keirstead - corey sandersand , 's beginning , right , think 've seen push towards aspect digital transformation sort spawning , right . way people work , way people engage change , way people buy , way people want use service experience , way people want build solution even . even concept building new technology fundamentally changed . see sort digital transformation accelerated incredible rate across sort company involves , right , think exciting unfortunate time period . think expansion really something focus . , think , look sort microsoft context , think , one thing part customer looking sort expansion digital transformation understanding component come together , right , think talk customer . conversation microsoft cloud also really sort accelerated last two year , right . n't one conversation productivity one conversation infrastructure , one conversation business apps . conversation around product come together . , whether 's software often time software partner solution intermix , mentioned partner folk 're talking even session . actually think another big change dynamic 're seeing sort solution come together deliver outcome going key focal point u customer part . corey , within various project part digital transformation , judgment made immediate priority 6-12 month pandemic hit might lifecycle sort leveling ? conversely priority put hold kind hit hard 6-12 month day sun finally getting funded ? yeah . think 's probably two part answer , think part one , really dependent upon customer business 're , right . like , could -- mean , 's sort new industry role exciting , different retail , obviously anyone retail n't vibrant online opportunity purchasing engaging support , immediate critical need figure right . whereas may find element let 's say financial service maybe le immediate sort need completely rework 're selling product , right . difference could much dependent upon customer business 're . think obvious one , collaboration technology , would say , security . really popped sort q - karl keirstead - corey sandersimmediate requirement think across entire landscape , right . fact everyone working home , need make sure collaboration capability work , tooling worked security model able deliver upon experience immediate . would say immediate spike , would n't say 's necessarily leveling , way expectation changing , right . remember first six month , could get meeting together worked , right . 's much conversation want meeting want able transact work understand data , look one single screen . expectation mean work collaboratively continuing go , right . , think spike , think they're sort increased focus . thing got delayed . absolutely thing customer-focused customer- centric , lot starting come back , 'll use retail example well , frontline worker , right , sort focus frontline worker experience , store closed , maybe could put little bit . sort lot retail back open sort priority actually reaccelerated big area focus . , yeah , think 's little bit industry , really specific . think big spike , even big spike think , sort uncertainty pandemic thing `` go back normal '' even original normal , think expectation collaborative work increasing , everyone 's expecting . let 's go back maybe point made earlier response question mentioned , fact , partner lot company mentioned 're fireside chat today . maybe broader question , spending change changing microsoft 's partner ecosystem . making shift , team front ? yeah . absolutely . think big focus look sort partner ecosystem opportunity , actually somewhat true even customer conversation , shifting selling product , actually going building together building solution . look exciting partner announcement believe 've coming , example , ( inaudible ) oil gas . 'll say , amadeus travel , blackrock hosting , aladdin service azure . co-build experience . , bringing resource , engineering team work together expert field able basically take expertise thing like collaborative application thing like infrastructure expertise data ai bring expertise folk know oil gas better u , know , financial service better u , know element better u . q - karl keirstead - corey sander q - karl keirstead - corey sandersand type partnership u basically co-building co-selling big shift u . one -- 's fact 'm really excited new job , 's really magic happens bringing expertise two side bring together , example even recent kyndryl announcement . bring sort strong expertise 've industry market capability horizontal service sort bringing life . 's definitely changing changed lot continue see opportunity work partner . got . okay , good perspective . let 's maybe use jumping point individual revenue segment within microsoft maybe 'll talk one everybody want talk , azure , congrats , way amazing success . sound like got start microsoft career engineer azure vm side , turned pretty big business , congrats team . thank . wanted ask couple specific question azure , one tough one u outside figure model conversion big multi-year azure commitment actually , usage therefore azure rev . guess supposition probably take time sign contract today , probably really n't see usage , sweet spot usage curve maybe another 12 18 month , 'd love ask corey perspective process work everybody listening sharper job trying model azure revenue going forward . yeah . guess , short answer point , 's complex , right . think complex , 's actually much tied customer , goal expectation point even sort previous discussion prioritization , right . mean , go range anywhere sign deal get data center year , lease . , 're incented heavily move quickly data center , may element 're transforming business , 're inventing new business model , going take time build , even scale , right . may start small one region grow . -- every big customer every big deal typically set type engagement sort , add consumption cloud . , , hard model frankly , n't envy . point 'd -- maybe 'd add hopefully helpful . one , look , going back previous point general 's urgency customer . q - karl keirstead - corey sandersthere 's urgency 's passion around making change , 've seen since 've azure 15 year ago moved azure team original product line . energy around moving 's , high . , see lot passion around going quickly one something signed sometimes even starting signed , right . mean , ability consumption service , start month sign move forward type deal . thing side 'd say take time like said , bigger investment continue make sort two element . one resource bring customer , right . bring sort engineering resource called cloud solution architect customer immediately upon signing sometimes signing single dollar consumption spent work customer , step need take pretty involved , right . need look reliability , need look security , need look cost going work , need look operation right 're team typically need educated learning skilling . framework built called well architected framework continually improve , really focused customer getting get value wanted get sign contract fast possible . 's work , shifting left like say getting customer deploying fast possible , always take time always people technology effort need made get full advantage . guess 's people element might constraint day hot topic street medium fact 's labor shortage bid engineer day . seeing example , corey ? sort struggle talent lack people constraining , ability microsoft 's large customer ramp use azure fast 'd like , reached acute level yet . yeah . would say least experience . think workforce shortage impact , say true , think since cloud started , think skilling area acute attention u . mean , 's area invest significant amount money go help customer 's skill going different , 's going feel different . , experience le sort people 's around making sure 're helping people take full advantage understand learn look , 's 'm sure everyone call appreciates , fast moving market 's kind point , right ? 's lot new technology coming time , 're really invested customer , make sure 're keeping 's best interest best interest . q - karl keirstead - corey sander q - karl keirstead got . corey , another part azure story 's tough u outside , get get handle mix service look like azure . think everybody 's impression customer board , 's probably pretty heavy use azurevm compute , storage called core infrastructure become mature azure user , graduate premium service , really n't good sense mix look like within premium service , popular bigger bucket opine little bit ? yeah , absolutely . think maybe two point 'd say , one experience , least 's le sort maturity curve , 's customer need , right . kind even come back previous , large customer work , two part customer 'm working simultaneously , one need close data center get onto vmware service azure quickly possible 're going stay , right . , ? get done ? got get lease , right . parallel , 'm talking manufacturing line , leverage iot data modernize enable able use ai predict outcome manufacturing line . exact time , company , maturity position , different conversation based need , right . , think 's 's big element customer need what's pushing market , right . think 's least one keep component . 's le nine month customer move iaa paas , 's actually like . 's even within customer workload 100 % paas day one , workload iaa never moved paas . 's also make think mix hard predict . ca n't sort see curve , right ? 's way per customer . said specific area . think ai ( multiple speaker ) absolutely data ai really sort one 's 've seen sort gigantic shift focus customer . think realization sort digital transformation push , start conversation . got lot data n't really know 'm supposed . conversation around sort getting data cloud enabling sort modern analytics , based solution enabling ai based predictive capability . almost always part digital transformation discussion , right . matter whether 's retail customer information whether 's oil gas , seismic information , whether 's , manufacturing iot based information . data strategy part discussion . really big area focus attention force . , maybe let 's hit right actually , 's hot topic tech investor , - corey sander q - karl keirstead - corey sander q - karl keirstead - corey sander q - karl keirstead - corey sander yeah . . 's good . even today . 've mongodb , informatica fireside chat . yesterday , fireside ceo ali data brick , day mike scarpelli snowï¬‚ake . think know folk actually . many case , product live azure . sure . case , think mentioned . service azure , yes . seem fairly well . 's pretty clear everybody , super interesting happening around data ai space . maybe ask weigh little bit microsoft 's product compete vendor . , one hand , 're partner largely want run azure , hand , 're going sit back sort seed market vendor merely collect compute resource consumption , 're going chase opportunity . compete actually partner big opportunity corey ? yeah . mean 's going sound , maybe little bit repetitive , start customer , right making sure 're delivering capability customer want need , right . , mentioned sort product mentioned , product could argue compete , compete element right discussion . opportunity support customer path want go , experience love snowï¬‚ake enabling snowï¬‚ake , enabling power bi right enabling sort team collaboration power bi supporting customer part journey great outcome u customer snowï¬‚ake right . , 're certainly going continue partnership make sure service run great infrastructure integration across entire stack . data ai giant surface area even product mentioned even subset , right surface area customer trying compliance , analytics , spark operational data , right complex broad surface area . q - karl keirstead - corey sander q - karl keirsteadand real strength come able offer solution across entire surface area able offer integration third party , customer would prefer able offer great first party solution prefer buy u 're already using service solution , right ? , think way kind kind complex answer . 's coming back 's reality customer ' environment , right . may reason , may passion one service , think end-to-end story really strength . willingness partner across one customer partner -- excuse , 'd love hear whether partner said , thing u , maybe take privately . . , maybe couple azure . taking back corey early microsoft day helping build azure vm suite . think asked average tech investor today , would argue 's little differentiate , compute resource , rented speak azure versus aws ec2 versus google cloud , compute , part team actually built azure vm suite . , guess , would probably disagree notion 're . maybe 'd love ask , 's actually different azure core compute side . yeah . think 're absolutely differentiation core compute , think certainly element 'd probably argue would commoditized . frankly , would probably -- service 's element commoditized element differentiated . place think offer really unique value , see lot interest sort specific component core compute actually gpu capability vm interconnect capability . like , 've seen growth sort data ai story mentioned one element able run complex ai solution . ai stack band sort really self service , super easy deploy cognitive service way really scale-out computing super custom requirement , 've seen -- customer requirement part story course , dependent upon right gpus , right vm interconnect , right connectivity . infiniband based connectivity continued big differentiator u market . see really big positive , see sort opportunity hpc ai based solution , 's one could go surrounding storage performance different tier storage capability sort ease use . actually think networking ease use becoming really important differentiator part stack . easy leverage networking use hybrid environment ? something see time actually particularly bank work sort networking complex getting , right , simple big differentiator would argue deep infrastructure . - corey sander q - karl keirstead - corey sander q - karl keirstead - corey sandersthat 's good . yeah , maybe one thing , 'll add super fast . course , bigger point differentiation fact point also find people n't make decision infrastructure , right . everything talked , right ? n't want hpc 're aivm 's running different cloud data service want data service cloud insight experience cloud collaboration experience . we're seeing like u least microsoft cloud differentiator way vms going go . also element would probably add conversation . answer long , hopefully , that's helpful . , . okay . 'm going ask one azure question . okay . , listen april brett , n't disclose azure gross margin , 've discussed improved time one source improvement eï¬ƒciency gain inside azure . one guy , sleeve rolled weed , give everybody listening , example eï¬ƒciency gain still left azure , might sort , squeeze little bit margin server . seems impossible n't squeezed lemon maximum yet , kind 's left , might eï¬ƒciency gain , maybe give u one example corey . yeah . mean , look think , like sort innovation space always going opportunity innovating area , right ? mean , certainly sort scale magnitude sort amount eï¬ƒciency gained may sort vary time , 's always opportunity gain part work provider , right ? think sort work improvement happening chip level memory level sort networking level , element come together using resource optimal way . even ai based . understanding customer usage right way making sure we're making decision based optimizing either power consumption placement protocol , going result u saving money . ongoing effort , effort requires constant innovation work , think 's exciting effort , right ? think 's , especially people deep stack , 's fun place , given scale 're working joke always q - karl keirstead - corey sandersmake , n't take big change big impact . something think , effort , planning twice year margin big component decision make around feature 're taking work 're putting place apply bottom line quite literally , , yeah . super helpful . let 's leave azure moment talk another exciting product area , 's team , cory . everybody listen trying figure . 's number variable , collaboration huge priority even said earlier . look next 18 month fade little bit , ï¬‚attened . 's one thing 're trying figure , 're trying figure microsoft team versus zoom versus webex versus salesforce , slack , competitive environment 's going play ? maybe could set framework u view usage adoption team changing see next year two ? yeah . 's probably area worth touching upon sort like already said growth sort expansion team usage last two year somewhat mind-blowing . mean , think 's super exciting see sort watch even going back previous role since run azure vms right , like , 's whole company behind , right ? 's exciting place u . think sort latest number nearly 250 million q4 fy21 . sort question , sort okay , great 's big number , go , right ? think 's probably area . one still opportunity grow user base , right ? one thing already even mentioned frontline worker ability sort think , enabling use retail right shift , enabling walkie-talkie usage . bringing capability team experience literally every employee company use 'll use , right ? 'll love , right ? work need happen 's tie back industry charter , work industry-specific , right ? 's different requirement someone 's working oil rig someone 's working local store . 've got work requirement deliver upon independently . 's opportunity base think could grow . think 's also lot opportunity u increase value resultantly increase revenue per user , right ? thing 've even already talked collaborative application , right . enabling partner already talked collaborative experience team 's environment . enabling team integrate additional service , like voice , right , contact center , right ? enabling sudden capability really shine part team 's experience . q - karl keirstead - corey sander q - karl keirstead - corey sandersand perhaps area think really important continue expand trust security story come team across entire platform . big reason people choose team believe trust 're offering 'd believe support . think 's -- 's really good opportunity u continue add value , course , continue gain revenue part people buying new service . got . let 's hit recent team announcement last week , think announced team ' essential . 's clearly targeted downstream small midsize business . stated price point $ 4 per user per month . describe strategy , hosting zoom couple hour earlier corey , certainly ask thought essential , 'd love ask ? thought watched , yeah , maybe tell oï¬ „ ine . look , think mentioned little bit expanding base look sort team essential , think 's another opportunity . small business different , right . requirement different , need different . think team essential see big opportunity company 25 employee le , right . 're looking sort meeting capability , , aspect data expect microsoft around sort trust yet ready purchase broader o365 mp65 suite . capability sort team standalone think quite appealing able offer platform smaller business customer enable lot point mentioned around sort expanding collaboration change may want make business , offering platform offering meeting experience really great opportunity u think offer lot value market looking value right . look , corey , would robut view microsoft taking team least , customer segment $ 3 $ 4 per user per month , difference that's product essential actually beefed-up version would otherwise get free . correct ? 's right . mean 's quite bit value , group video call 30 hour , group chat , file-sharing , right . even calendaring like , capability well beyond call one person talk , right . mean , concept focused small business need small business need person person phone call , right . 's really strategy would rebuttal told call . q - karl keirstead - corey sander q - karl keirstead let 's talk oï¬ƒce . obviously , one franchise inside microsoft 's portfolio . bigger news microsoft elected march 1st raise price point across important skus . maybe could help frame , think right time microsoft make move corey 've interfacing customer , like 's reaction price increase ? little bit pushback ? shoulder shrug ? 's happening term reaction ? yeah . price increase share little bit background , we've actually increased oï¬ƒce 365 price since june 2011 , right . , pretty astounding time period . yet time period , last four year , since microsoft 365 , 've added 24 , like distinct full apps , including team , power apps , power bi , power automate . , 's always deep conversation 're adding value price point match value 're adding 's constant conversation , decision point need met . , course , primary goal getting right value customer , making sure right competitive price point . , 's kind background least change sort -- think timing change . broader customer perspective , 's , want careful speaking holistically every customer world , customer work conversation much broader one seat pricing , right ? , even coming back previous discussion conversation always full microsoft cloud element dynamic element power apps , element m365 element azure element data . , conversation really around outcome customer getting 's total roi type outcome . like , 'm saying price n't important customer , price conversation much le line item line item 's much paying microsoft roi 'm going get . conversation sort blip , right , conversation much bigger much broader . , want careful saying n't mean n't customer going want conversation . want realistic , least conversation 've , always bigger broader much total roi conversation line item , price item . got . perfect . 've probably got five minute . let take couple question . one came corey , 'll read back . reference think customer anecdote made wanting get data center move vmware azure . question , would customer lift shift onto vmware azure without actually rewriting underlying code data take advantage cloud offer ? - corey sander q - karl keirstead - corey sander yeah . mean , actually going back , n't know four question ago five question ago . mean , primary reason skill set dependent tooling . mean , customer 's always hard make generalized statement customer built really extensive toolset dependency chain product like vmware , right . partnership vmware fantastic vmware offer lot modernization capability top container based solution . want careful say vmware n't modern solution like 're offering capability top , modernize way customer dependency customer n't dependency look service capability . , really sort customer starting point , skill set , 're comfortable 're built environment going dictate first step take . partnership critical , 're helping customer journey , whatever starting point 're starting point often time going different partner different place vmware fantastic partner regard offering modernization , also offering really fast lift shift capability customer deeply invested vmware , many , customer . exactly . okay , maybe 'll finish another question subject , n't hit 's sort core window franchise spirit question , microsoft done great job last five , ten year taking lot traditional business essentially moving cloud , moving traditional license maintenance model one 's radical subscription usage-based . large portion core window business still sort window oem upfront license sale . 'd curious , microsoft try take window business cloud radical subscription era ? two thing 've noticed recently seemed effort would azure virtual desktop way marry window azure think microsoft recently launched cloud pc product might effect . touch traction 're seeing far , product might disrupting ? yeah . , combination two product actually pretty exciting set solution offer . especially given even think question one , digital transformation movement security trust sort central point . created lot demand cloud-based desktop , right , able run desktop cloud , able leverage create zero trust environment local machine , right found many , many customer built dependency around . expectation integrates collaboration capability , like team , like oï¬ƒce365 et cetera . q - karl keirstead - corey sandersand big shift think pandemic actually one sort big spike question 've seen pandemic , get employee virtual environment cloud desktop create zero trust opportunity on-premise -- excuse , hub . 's sort solution really offer combination two offer full range , even sort taking previous question applying window 365 offer really actually exciting new way run sort window experience including apps data setting sort automated managed cloud , right , 's fantastic way truly get windows-based experience natively cloud . virtual desktop , one 've seen huge amount traction excitement around , particularly around strong partnership citrix vmware , offering solution natively cloud experience , customer use , love , want grow top , allows able deploy experience directly azure infrastructure scalable cloud-based expectation . range give customer choice allows customer pick accelerates movement digital motion , offering sort window based experience fully scalable cloud-based way . corey , could talk another hour , unfortunately , got cut 'm sure 've got day job need get back anyway . sooner later , yeah , exactly . thanks carving time u thanks , april brett enabling corey attend conference tell microsoft story ubs' client . thank happy holiday . thanks lot .
