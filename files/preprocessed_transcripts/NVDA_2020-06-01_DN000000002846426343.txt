's hard know , specific much impacted overall covid-19 , piece saw right bat overall close retail channel , impacted gaming business start term retail sale , well icafe shut overall asia-pac joseph moorearea . quickly saw move e-tail , people asia pac area begun working home , school shut , time also learn home teach home period . know , shutdown worldwide , led sort determining overall entertainment would happen period time gaming really place people turn toward , find entertainment overall home . , able quickly agile company focus moving towards e-tail focused get overall gaming end customer , worked pretty well . moved pandemic , pandemic within quarter moved worldwide able really leverage learning asia pac china area think inﬂuence worldwide . keep mind though , thing every single country , every culture different . really focused u understanding supplier , understanding supply chain process pretty much connection weekly basis , daily basis case assure understood facing . overall asia pacific area restarted faster part world . getting overall people manufacturing actually building overall product , still worse challenge term logistics . challenge term moving supply place place , connection top supplier connection manufacturing aided u process . unique demand , particularly overall compute , data center stayed intact thought beginning quarter . really , working overall supply logistics issue quarter . feel fortunate company term business chosen . know many still challenged covid-19 overall business . expect also continue q2 , highlighted probably continuation covid-19 q2 overall guidance , particularly regarding automotive business . automotive business legacy infotainment system challenged likely see automotive decline approximately 40 % q1 . also expect professional visualization project -- product continue seek overall business come back covid-19 likely decline sequentially q1 q2 well . overall gaming , gaming still area think demand important , well overall data center continue ramp new product a100 lineup overall ai . great , 's helpful overview 's impressive job maneuvering 's obviously really tough environment everyone . wanted walk segment little bit detail , starting cloud , since 's sort theme conference , well fact 's half colette kresscompany trajectory half company least . maybe could start looking back little bit putting strength 've seen context , grew 80 % year-on-year quarter , something saw coming . last year , saw kind digestion . want talk newer driver thing driving strength . think , know , 's post mortem digestion saw , year half ago ? know , sort prognosis going forward know , going continue lumpy business ? kind thing , kind maybe put perspective u , 'd helpful . sure . look back , even last three plus year introduction v100 deploying many overall data center internal use , well cloud , lot lesson learned , also lot overall expansion term customer start put place . look term initial rollout v100 , sure , started overall hyperscales . started large customer found importance ai overall business model , overall monetization really saw important piece future whether think application even basic think search switch internet . , began significant amount work working build using overall accelerated computing . moore 's law quickly coming end . well discussed also need allow ai used overall cloud environment . , three thing around really started overall surge interest , surge overall demand term internal engineering team , also surfacing cloud . important way overall enterprise , higher education research could get first hand using overall accelerated computing . , recall time , also challenge provider shortness overall supply . cpu shortage signaled overall market . , look back -- overall digestion calling 're building overall data center build , inﬂuence also cpu shortage made even cloudy people understand overall demand would . time , purchasing ahead need -- data center , would short overall product likely happened period time . , 've turned new architecture announced a100 overall work last three year , built stronger list customer , ( inaudible ) customer procurement certain part overall engineering , understanding workload , project 's , actually help inﬂuence importance lead time long take order build overall data center qualify overall help . overall significant breadth depth customer , hope help u go forward . , still likely , time time single customer may joseph moore colette kressbe digesting , may finishing build start new one . hope overall large project stuck top keep overall outlook smooth . believe process working forecasting lead time help improve , better understanding forecast going forward . okay , 's helpful . thank . maybe could talk new application , first conversational ai . 's something u talking interestingly , started hearing directly cloud customer sort talking priority around transformer language translation look model , order -- amount complexity , number parameter literally million time computer vision model looked like . , clearly big jump complexity , pretty big compute workload , talk ramp . going something that's narrow across couple cloud customer broaden application set , , 's interesting broader base enterprise . sure . concept conversational ai initial model built last summer late spring time last year really started surface . bert model surfaced , many derivative bert , one started many overall hyperscales direct working , really understood desire build overall complexity model support overall conversational ai . conversational ai , underpinnings , natural language understanding many part . 's single overall function work . 3-step four-step process necessary much natural language understanding happening term understanding overall speech , tongue , overall dialog , well understanding word use term , question , trying solve . lastly , able respond solid low amount time order within reason expecting response back.now , 're seeing , 're still early stage , needed order complete , size ability compute order help process . , coming overall software , importantly , a100 allows expand work take larger larger model complex model work . 're seeing desire bring overall speech bring written overall data , taking type form factor ability model larger size address diﬃcult work . 're early stage , 's necessarily something 's overall hyperscales see lot also part overall cloud computing cloud computing really enterprise using overall cloud think many instance need overall conversational ai , whether overall call center , whether way converse overall company whole . joseph moore colette kress joseph moore colette kressso , focusing first term work hyperscalers done , really see new way collaboration likely happen overall enterprise well . great , thank . area guy talked quite bit recently , recommendator engine various terminology refer , complexity model sort maybe le intuitive . , obviously really important economics cloud customer . talk little bit work load ? sure . direct mandate engine , see across overall internet , term hyperscalers also tier 2 consumer internet company may top overall cloud instance term run business , know yet basic news come every single day generally high overall recommend data engine . type news interest , type thing read , continue provide thing meet need overall interest , go way term overall procurement well . think procure business and-or personally , another area recommendator engine important . think complex model become term targeting marketing also speed back term recommendation , term whether driving whether 're phone . , overall processor , definitely able process significant amount recommendator engine , also remember , set application work better serve overall recommendator engine term software support function well . okay , great . thing , found pretty exciting business ai inference , know nvidia chip historically dominated market training , building large database inference , access database happened traditional cpu , business become pretty sizable guy . , clearly continue make progress ultimately market offer similar size training . , talk progress ? yeah inference outlined couple year ago , felt large market . large market felt appropriate overall gpu computing . overall inferencing 're talking though necessarily inferencing past . 're correct , 's cpu dominated overall piece . lot single function binary type overall inference , cpu , may perfectly fine . , think using gpus overall inferencing joseph moore colette kressgoing forward , complexity inferencing model multiple stage put gpu great place overall programmability , also overall speed accomplished using overall gpo . using conversational ai past think training process conversational ai moving inference great overall use case gpus overall inferencing . started business unique form factor inﬂuencing could slotted directly existing oem server term pci-e slot . t4 example well engineered candy bar size well low wattage , order add overall infrencing overall compute reached point inferencing sizable percentage overall data center business . solidly double digit percent overall data center . , 's interesting , 's doubling year-over-year last quarter . , also think a100 , a100 engineered built accomplish training inferencing move forward . , overall customer choose say workload trying going , ability choose a100 . ability partitioned multiple virtual instance individual instance could used overall inferencing , overall performance improvement versus using v100 also ﬂexibility single platform accomplish training inferencing . great . 's good segway , want ask a100 ampere family . thing n't come along frequently guy . 's first new architecture 3 year . appears 've said 've heard customer , significant advancement state art . talk little bit ampere , performance benefit brings ? , really business term growing number workload address driving business going forward well dealing competition . great . , yes , a100 ampere architecture , right earnings , week opportunity u launch world see 've working last 3 year . originally , probably targeted communicated gtc san jose back march , move little bit try find right forum communicate . , launched couple week ago , full production part overall q1 result . a100 architecture largest ﬂeet production -- performance versus architecture past . a100 alone 20x stronger performance versus overall v100 . 7 nanometer . greatest performance 7 nanometer . also largest chip , overall 7 nanometer . 're using opportunity launch a100 unique manner think help deployment ability bring many different customer . launching 8 gpus together overall base board . overall configuration , easily slipped joseph moore colette kresstheir existing overall infrastructure future also overall oem service well . unique discussed , provides ability execute training well inferencing . important piece much time spent customer , whether hyperscales , whether enterprise term choosing ai platform accelerated platform , important piece allows mobility create 7 instance per gpu 8 gpus , multiplication factor many overall instance . , important term a100 architecture overall performance straight overall hardware , keep mind , could look important software play well . cuda 11 , come . cuda 11 underlying development language platform every one gpus , well therefore overall architecture ampere . important piece underlying driver many enterprise specific overall application address . also provide software specific many key industry , vertical industry key place believe accelerated bridge . thing also launched ampere architecture new software enhancement help conversational ai , help overall recommendators , help overall anything term data analytics work overall spark . work , 3rd generation tensor quarter overall ampere architecture important piece allows high performance computing , also dialing term precision may use overall gpus position different workload . , 're excited overall ampere architecture , software also brought market top overall cuda cuda-x great . maybe 's good segue competitive question . particular , question webcast get lot , think custom silicon hyperscale customer , obviously google prominently , others talked well . talk importance new product competition expect negative growth point road , customer trying develop customer ( inaudible ) ? case . looking custom ability custom silicone largely due large workload may see front may overall cost silicon support . found , platform probably agnostic platform need work , cpu , type component data center well type software . , ability work seamlessly joseph moore colette kress joseph mooreacross different framework ai well different type cloud infrastructure extremely important people think using overall nvidia 's gpus , always ability framework continue write top framework . however framework still need revision , still made work done , always ability jump overall cuda development platform add expand . believe performance well meeting need customer always upheld quite strongly . think back overall fall timeframe ( inaudible ) came overall training well inferencing , really time u demonstrate benchmarking standpoint hardware software combination , put u best breed , often see custom overall asics may , becomes challenging overall compute overall universal capability overall gpu based speed ai ai development something may work today , 've seen 3,000x improvement term model size , well complexity ai ﬂexibility platform really enables u . , overall hyperscales partner look need see workload may need specific asic , may work time period , n't think really applies broad market , really need ﬂexibility thing moving fast . great . 's worth , mean , 've , 've heard directly developer custom silicon application work still high demand gpus ( inaudible ) , another question webcast geography cloud business , talk little bit positioning china versus u possible extent u go digestion phase china would continue strong . yeah . region operate differently serve major overall cloud provider , around world . cloud provider u built larger overall capex budget bigger nature one china . china hyperscales also second tier quite broad . 's china , overall asia pac area , continue serve , think help u term differentiation overall customer overall cloud continue see project overall stack . go form digestion . , ability expand overall customer project one follow single one customer go digestion . okay . maybe sum , organic cloud business , 've sort said , seems like pretty healthy growth july . said probably colette kress joseph moore colette kressneed time ass happens beyond july , seems totally reasonable . , seems like business offer lot breadth application breadth customer saw couple year ago , fair ? fair . think a100 're early stage multi-year ramp . demand strong a100 . visibility q2 used providing overall guidance q2 . look q3 q4 , given overall environment , 're need little bit time really size , term see q3 q4 'll provide get time . great . make sense . maybe talk little bit mellanox , 've talked rationale deal , business obviously really strong . , deal closed , give u update fit nvidia portfolio maybe , know acquired cumulus right , seems 're committed networking maybe bigger way realized second transaction , seems like area nvidia plan continue grow . yeah , mellanox acquisition , 're really pleased acquisition close month ago q2 result full quarter undrawn mellanox business . mellanox quite well last year . think saw , even overall announcement acquisition continued partnership , still stand-alone quite quite well last year . , 're really pleased bring part overall business incorporated data center business . question , great addition family product overall data center business . 've seen u focus term accelerated computing , accelerated computing , one key area overall ai , 's also base overall high performance computing overall supercomputing . mellanox brings expertise absolutely area customer . 've learned compute time spent overall computing data information essential term acceleration , also component , key inﬂuence overall acceleration overall data center whole . think modernization data center , go forward , really thinking layer software defined acceleration inﬂuence acceleration whole 're overall focused . leadership term interconnects leadership high-performance computing overall supercomputing put probably one best partnership could imagine , bringing board time data center .
