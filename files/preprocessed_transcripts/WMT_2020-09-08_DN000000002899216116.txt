'll place conservative . merchant n't something exactly like , 've period time either good bad holiday economic standpoint . 're pretty good knowing work way . okay . maybe turning e-com becoming le unprofitable , guess , think people trying -- struggling little bit think - term 's structural nature , term permanency le unprofitable e-com business . maybe kind talk little bit put take think going forward ? sure . think really last , 'd say , 12 month even , 've talking positive thing seeing profitability side e-commerce . -- several lever within . one sale growth obviously . two increased -- increased rate fixed cost ; variable cost fulfillment , 's contribution margin . four thing watch really closely . lot tailwind e-commerce business second quarter , already seen thing first quarter , make u feel good structurally 're making progress . obviously , almost double size business quarter , help -- help leverage expense way line . work 've done past several quarter getting brand online , particularly home apparel higher margin category , help lot contribution margin , , grow sale , actually start leveraging fixed cost pretty rapid rate . -- seeing already last couple quarter , certainly showed second quarter . 's kind thing structurally feel good 're going wo n't maybe look good second quarter , karen short brett biggs karen short brett biggs karen shorta demonstration u way 're thinking e-commerce model right saw looked like second quarter . okay . maybe , elaborate little bit term capital , , would required going forward respect walmart+ fulfillment center general ? also maybe update many skus walmart+ e-comm , whether actually mirrored fcs think -- one two big point pre-covid . yeah .

've talked capital could look like next couple year , 've kind $ 10 billion $ 12 billion range period time . think , year , 's probably right , 's assumption increasing fulfillment capacity . 've seen second -- first second quarter , really get e-commerce business ramped wanted . maybe add capacity faster anticipated ; maybe year two , number go , overall , feel good ability add capacity rate make sense financial standpoint . respect fcs , capability fairly meaningfully broaden marketplace skus , correct , without incremental -- increasing actual capacity size facility ?
