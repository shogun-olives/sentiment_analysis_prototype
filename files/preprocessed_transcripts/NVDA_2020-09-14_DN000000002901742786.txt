's lot work term supporting infrastructure start licensing making instruction set usable easy work . , focus going taking expertise arm together u . 's n't think opportunity , certainly opportunity use arm help u get market , that's focus going close deal . , strategically , see benefit ability combine ip offer one bundle like arm business model taking arm brings allowing accelerate nvidia 's ability deliver actual silicon ip , direction think beneficial actually ? well , stepping back , n't bundling situation , n't , really knowing arm already great following architecture license core provide provide another option overall customer expanding choice would available . , 're right , go multiple different way . say , overall customer needing , customer needing overall architecture opportunity develop , customize take chip overall manufacturing , need overall license core already built kind capability want overall core want something completely already taped , completed overall chip put time system system together . , 're right , optionality , many different type solution brought together nvidia arm . think -- maybe last strategic question , think asset historically , even sold softbank , appeared one believed could owned another merchant silicon provider inherent conﬂict interest would perceived anybody wanted license arm could potentially competing owner architecture . get around either real perceived conﬂict interest ? think arm nvidia foundation company , company quite overall open company overall agnostic overall ecosystem relatively neutral overall term support overall market . example , nvidia support every overall cpu market today , whether 'd x86 , whether 'd power arm work 've arm . , similar manner q - ross seymore - colette kressbeing quite neutral ecosystem able provide product overall . best thing company want make sure integrate different platform creating platform together next generation ai something term energy eﬃciency , like arm . , believe arm nvidia actually quite complementary total . believe articulate well -- customer well customer arm , truly see benefit two company working together . , n't pivot little bit regulatory concern . think much like potential conﬂict interest dynamic play regulatory concern well , sound like 've customer conversation already , jensen mentioned call morning simon already talked bunch customer . think regulatory environment , first , sound like 18-month close , least six month longer average deal close . , 's -- seems endorse believe complex , whether 's structure deal sheer size deal . importantly think customer competitor one side government trying ensure employment sort thing given region , side think complex get deal done ? engaged side , customer competitor government side , get point willing announce deal last night ? okay . , let 's first start overall regulatory side deal . expect go get regulatory approval beginning u , probably eu , uk probably overall china . know , recently regulatory approval process 've worked mellanox 're familiar regulatory team jurisdiction , process we've actually learned lot . think learned lot nvidia process well . , believe , yes , likely 18 month sometimes little bit similar seen mellanox . think we're basing based work overall deal . mellanox work lot data center business . little bit larger scope 's many different overall market 've probably added couple month versus long took u overall finish mellanox acquisition . think regulatory approval , really assuring availability customer today maintaining overall competition market go forward . , talk complementary mess overall arm nvidia well plan commit arm 's existing licensing model essentially preserve arm 's customer neutrality , think overall regulatory process move quite well . believe deal total pretty much pro- q - ross seymore - colette kresscompetitive term outlined . think affect customer and/or country ' access overall arm 's technology . , second part question really talking different jurisdiction around world focusing area uk . uk overall home arm right . based overall cambridge . saw term announcement , truly want keep home term developed technology 30 year much rp based . believe help add already market , focusing next wave ai . plan build ai center cambridge , like 're home add set high top overall researcher overall cambridge area , cambridge university focus building supercomputer build work also data center bring cpu important workload . , think focused jurisdiction , focused need providing neutrality , competitiveness access region customer may need . thanks color , colette . n't wrap nvidia-arm discussion couple financial related question . believe press release slide deck , said last 12 month ending march , asset $ 1.8 billion revenue , 94 % pro forma gross margin 35 % adjusted ebitda margin . look forward revenue side thing , talked earlier bringing nvidia ip kind mobile end spectrum arm ip data center server end spectrum . talk revenue growth assumption and/or vision revenue growth look like company ? , correct . term purchasing , purchasing overall ipg business arm . remain softbank isg business , announced earlier area bring potentially sell overall business . focused high quality business , high gross margin reoccurring revenue platform come ipg business arm . believe great opportunity expand current market actually working today , mobile , data center , infrastructure , automotive iot instruction focus technology able license technology market , also see opportunity working new project , addressing market data center turbocharging work done expand business well . , 's little early talk size overall growth , benefit think side term growing market u . q - ross seymore - colette kress q - ross seymore - colette kress q - ross seymore mentioned turbocharging arm 's investment , given nvidia's greater r & capacity , think lot targeted towards data center side thing , could broader statement overall well . think profitability , 35 % number 're looking , 're turbocharging , something opex going rise ? relate revenue ? sort target profitability kind roadmap profitability side thing would helpful well . yeah . believe business arm , ipg business continuing improve overall financial metric , margin well overall revenue top line . , even overall 18 month , think 'll see actually improve period . think investment really helping build opportunity term top line , think thing driven together could improvement margin time . could possibility getting back higher margin , one seen back 2016 time went private working softbank . great . last question -- actually two final question . 'm sure 're going answer either , got give shot anyway . talk gross margin accretion upon conclusion deal , think everybody get face value . eps accretion seems like 's little complex potentially . significant revenue growth and/or margin expansion assumption behind ? 're willing give specific number , suspect 're , sort assumption dependent one side versus , revenue versus margin ? . 's specific . , business likely continue grow overall close acquisition , accretive . we're buying business profitable right bat think help overall eps . 're correct , gross margin easy piece mostly software . absolutely turn positive gross margin versus corporate company average . great . thanks color , colette . n't give actual break talking deal today , suspect 're going continue done chatting let 's go different part business pivot specifically gaming side equation . announced week two ago rtx 3000 family , ampere 7-nanometer 8-nanometer , guess , case based samsung . talk little bit launch . seems performance benefit quite enormous , strategy go-to-market side seems little le pricing side turing generation - colette kresspascal generation much performance seemingly going unit growth . , talk little bit technology benefit 're delivering pricing growth target strategically rtx family ? yes . , arm certainly exciting last 24 hour , ca n't forget exciting launch ampere architecture gaming well . geforce rtx 30 series , geforce rtx 30 series probably one biggest generational leap gaming . 2x performance improvement versus turing 1.9x power eﬃciency overall turing . unbelievably compelling lineup kick ampere architecture product cycle gaming . second generation rtx , real-time ray tracing , extends overall leadership ray tracing geforce . also 2x performance think referred overall price band overall price point . also second generation rt core 2x throughput versus previous generation 's third generation tensor core 2x throughput previous generation . , statement regarding given performance increasing quite strongly overall price point , expect term unit also asp position . , focusing term growth market ability attract refresh existing overall desktop and/or pc definitely opportunity well attracting new overall gamers market . right , become one important entertainment medium . lot inﬂuenced change , may new norm going forward . many u looking live overall entertainment work home , teach home therefore play home game home . lot inﬂuenced excitement new generation card provide . second thing key term people coming market new game coming market . launch overall ampere architecture , also launched significant amount software help inﬂuence gaming experience , gaming experience whether normal gamer new game coming market using ray trace technology and/or dl improving ai ray tracing experience broadcaster looking key better represent work term gaming web . , many different thing bring people market right buy gaming . price point though opportunity u continue raise bar entry level and/or refresh want game . , example , 're really looking overall average asp overall gaming . past , 've volume skus , volume skus important around world allows whether first entrant refresher common get access ray tracing overall affordability . what's interesting top overall performance card taken quite nicely performance increased content term ray tracing . , expect probably increase mix type card q - ross seymore - colette kresspeople buying towards overall higher end . , also continue increase average asp also inﬂuenced increase unit new user well refreshing .
