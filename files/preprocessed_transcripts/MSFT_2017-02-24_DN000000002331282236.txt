'll notice talk enterprise performance management , talk production planning , talk cognitive ai [ ph ] , talk continuous analytics , get idea , mean big data one size fit , single entity , actually collective conglomerate multiple spread across entire software spectrum . classify big data ? one thing need note need define big data , lot industry term , talk big data different way , u , really volume variety velocity . volume mean data collected excess 100 terabyte [ ph ] , generated growing 60 % and/or received high-speed streaming deployed dynamically adaptable infrastructure . key lot static application used traditional business analytics use case . much infrastructure pretty static rigid . big data , structure data changing rapidly , need agility , need elasticity . ultimately , three key principle ; volume , variety velocity provide big data . one mention structure value , ultimately value information generated relevant business , business n't find value information , big data analytics ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) meaning . important know iterative cycle find thing n't know , iterative cycle answer question 're asking . year talk big data workï¬‚ow think big data big sieve information data -- raw data pass , get processed ultimately get applied base . 's eye chart , 'm going bore information icon . note 's data created , data acquired , information processed ultimately fed business process . becomes important , 's loop , business know 're getting generate question ask data generated , feedback cycle 's continuous cycle go many business , fact , entire business run . data creation , data acquisition , machine processing ultimately business process . said , would sort jump right number . seeing 2017 would expect big data cross 32 billion , 32 billion includes software , hardware service . see , big chunk market comprises infrastructure , hardware reason ultimately see right , pie chart show lot big data various reason , governance , regulatory , compliance stored , stored much longer one would expect , stored ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) people n't want believe data know necessary information contained . people hang data lot . computer important , people analyze data see networking infrastructure -- infrastructure form smaller portion market . similarly , notice business analytics market going $ 153 billion market 2017 , , growing much faster . see , compute side business analytics form bigger portion infrastructure market . 's need explain big data business analytics interchangeable . business analytics uber market , 's bigger market think big data portion segment business analytics overall business analytics market . 're seeing $ 153 billion market , 100 % -- 'm sorry , 100 % big data market sub- segment bigger -- business analytics market . , going back previous slide , slide 'll notice business analytics big data set , business analytics also small data set . many business analytics function n't operate terabyte scale data set . operate small data set . , know , differentiation come three slide ago talked big data workload classified . classified big data workload , everything else becomes business analytics workload . 's important note big data anything foreign , portion business analytics market . 2017 , made taxonomy change make 100 % segment business analytics . compare ? talked previously , could look market fashion , look big data rest analytics . rest analytics see growing , 's growing much smaller rate big data market , growing lot faster rate . reason many data set people operate today require different form processing , data set becoming larger larger . luxury dealing small data set longer . many data set increase size , sheer quantity collection mechanism . example , 're dealing mobile data , sheer number smartphones , mobile data extremely high . give another example , talk aircraft engine generating data , single ï¬‚ight given amount sensor present different aspect aircraft engine . total ï¬‚ight time generates whole lot data need analyzed . luxury dealing smaller data set luxury dealing static data set longer , 's becoming niche . , sort wanted end [ ph ] key market driver inhibitor . key market driver ? 'm going go . key thing , increased belief data driven decision making much sea-level executive convinced decision ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) nature , driven data . used portion executive [ ph ] driven gut driven market sentiment , day data driven emphasis much 's pretty big risk , base decision data . second availability data , lot democratization -- democratization data mean many company get access social medium data , get access anonymized machine generated data , anonymized mobile data , anonymized financial data use better inform . availability data make easier decision making superior versus ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) make decision based data disposal . third one demand self-service . era people n't want wait , people want able service request directly lot emphasis automation behind scene , data integration automation result emphasis based automated analytics cognitive analytics ai machine learning . lot company focused self-service big data result lot investment software 's segment even service segment . inhibitor ? main two inhibitor wanted talk macroeconomic factor , clearly place much buyer sentiment economic situation country , region industry . seeing ebb ï¬‚ow , 'm -- guy expert , 'm going talk . know market sentiment directly impacted macro-economic factor . second one talk length , , impact source . world , thanks linux thanks apache open-source foundation . world software becoming increasingly -- open-source entity people want spend software , get open-source based variant available . developer becoming lot powerful company , developer get access snippet code directly open-source world construct stack without commercial -- need buy commercial off-the-shelf software . see slide number , hardware segment growing , obviously , 's want run analytics . service segment growing people obviously n't want give turnkey element . software revenue segment growing much lot revenue getting lost open-source alternative . dearth open-source alternative every segment software spectrum , whether cognitive , whether machine learning , whether kind analytics like hadoop . see dearth open-source alternative . , fact , company culture in-house , developer n't need go software , use open-source . finally , wanted end note main market trend ; first public cloud provider like amazon google microsoft continuing aggressively invest big data analytics , sort building value - mandeep singhproposition beyond infrastructure service therefore going enterprise segment . -- big data ecosystem play , wo n't single company dominate . ecosystem , know , give example , hadoop spark ecosystem . sort growing ecosystem iot space . ecosystem growing cognitive space . ecosystem dominate big data space allows people take modular approach -- approach building stack . infrastructure vendor , think see largely giving software effort going partnership . 's going partnership hadoop distributor , spark distributor really making sure focus enabling software versus developing software . see cognitive artificial intelligence machine learning initially offshoot , look taxonomy , clearly offshoot bigger analytics market , eventually become standalone market grow become mature . lastly , money follow open-source hadoop best example give , linux good example , know , company like red hat million [ ph ] commercializing linux suse following , canonical following . money ï¬‚ow open-source ecosystem , turn ï¬‚ow open-source community shape form give rise vendor building model based building business model based open-source -- commercializing open source . , wanted end note open call q & . , back , mandeep . question answer yeah , thank , ashish . , comprehensive would encourage everybody call send question , . meantime , question , ashish . 've following big data market long time , focus shifted structured , unstructured data predictive analytics , recommendation engine . 's kind evolving , get sense roi n't obvious come big data project sometimes take long investment cycle really say , okay , achieve using big data system . would say standalone big data kind future overlay ai cloud really drive roi ? - ashish nadkarni - mandeep singh - ashish nadkarni think 's latter , 's great question , basically one trend big data seeing , -- technology going nascent , primitive technology mature market . people realizing create [ ph ] big data science experiment , create big data iterative model people sitting lab somewhere generating data data analyzing analyzing . tied business outcome business outcome people evolve thing like internet thing able deliver product entirely based market data collection , overlaying cognitive machine learning , fact conference last week ibm attached watson internet thing . watson iot platform developed munich , 's service play company encouraged collocate developer ibm , tie analytics internet thing . , whole thing become focus gather data market device analyze make . roi becomes almost mandate people say , right , i'm investing x number dollar enabling -- internet enabling washing machine example . need able -- per dollar -- per unit cost roi . reducing number customer support call , reducing number failure component forth , roi becomes overall objective . iot system let 's say driverless car use case pick anything healthcare going big data use case -- else need along standard big data technology like hadoop spark based environment . else need make project successful like , company think , kind implementing big data system ? sure . sort , let start making sort general statement , think term big data slowly melting blending whole business analytics thing . sort started use term big data analytics overall market . reason unpack big data , data storage component , big data part analytics , part slowly getting attached industry use case . mentioned autonomous vehicle , mentioned healthcare , every data storage part , talked structured unstructured piece previous question , data storage part moving much meaning format data changing much . - mandeep singh - ashish nadkarniwhat changing analytics piece . analytics piece slowly becoming specialized , industry centric , use case driven , , , kind driven . 's thing like cognitive artificial intelligence ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) learning , three different way , get -- become lot prevalent . , call big data analytics general term know big data piece static say data storage piece le changing two -- analytics piece dynamic two 's get industry use case get model data ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) example , specialized based outcome kind stuff . really important distinction , think really help u understand much better way part big data market actually moving faster versus -- said data storage part , static . note , company think applying analytics piece use case oriented way able establish clear- cutting edge use case , vendor come mind ? , let kind take industry segment segment easier talk way . apart basic side , right ? company like nvidia intel , focusing lot hardware aspect accelerated computing . 's lot focus gp , gpu 's , fpgas thing enhance capability would call industry standard . started research big data , beat cpu server analyze much data . increasing emphasis , hey , cpu ca n't everything , memory server ca n't everything , need able oï¬ „ oad onto ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) gp , gpus fpgas . , company like nvidia , amd , intel , focusing accelerated computing . whole , ï¬‚ash array market , alive well lot focus analyze large quantity data without beating upon spinning desk . whole memory segment , company like sandisk western digital . component vendor coming superior silicon superior memory hold large quantity data . fact , read comment day , intel thinking , 2017 , memory market going grow 's lot newer big data technology use recomputing , sap hana one . 's kind see infrastructure market reached plateau speed feed , branching different type compute model , , compute storage model . - mandeep singh - ashish nadkarniand let 's shift software ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) , 'm software expert , see , company becoming specialized industry specific use case . give example , whole watson , ibm watson iot , driven applying cognitive layer internet thing layer . ibm example , company called cognitive scale , based watson lot healthcare specific stuff . , company like splunk operational analytics , course lot emphasis spark investment . ibm committed like couple billion dollar ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) spark . lot company trying make spark standard overlay top hadoop model , cloudera hortonworks mapr variance , spark . traditional company like oracle teradata getting market . underlying theme lot lot start-ups . hardware , infrastructure space might become lot cooled little bit , would say , minus comment made earlier gpus , software space seems much alive well . 's lot activity building industry specific use case . one thing mention sort straddle software hardware blockchain . notice idc focusing lot blockchain year . think blockchain context big data analytics going huge , primarily drive lot security . lot focused secured transaction blockchain become important , blockchain compute-intensive ledger system . lot analytics behind ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) people working make sure blockchain transaction optimized . course , let 's forget service , company bpo market earlier , tech mahindra example , becoming focused analytics service , big data service , public cloud service provider getting lot -- many company n't know get . making easier others get . great . question audience , steve , asking , big data open source software powerful commercially available software ? depends see whole stack , -- let 's take vanilla hadoop example , year ago , hadoop became known enterprise lot company show stick commercial plugins . , survey three year ago , amount -- number company going vanilla hadoop , whole hadoop distribution limited minority , vanilla hadoop lot problem , lot single point failure , stable . - mandeep singh - ashish nadkarnifast forward three year later , many thing [ ph ] ironed , many issue sorted , vanilla hadoop lot stable , 's lot robust . , something start open source , never good commercial variant commercial ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) developer , many work company contributing code commercial space , well open source space much tune challenge address . period time , issue get sorted . additionally , take spark example . spark ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) apache foundation open source project , would probably seen slower trajectory term commercialization enterprise readiness , . company like ibm cloudera others making spark priority . , today , year , spark conference . , lot commercial vendor going put might behind spark . accelerates adoption , accelerates development effort . , overall start see lot open source project become lot -- give commercial variance run money shorter amount time . want piggyback , basically lot legacy data warehousing company , huge installed base kind dipping toe new big data solution based hadoop spark mentioned . -- way industry headed ? going change data warehousing solution new kind evolving technology big data realm 're going continue . see data warehousing market evolving ? , think short medium term perhaps even long run , traditional data warehousing market probably going -- okay reason directly fed traditional business analytics business intelligence application . see enterprise , whether retail whether healthcare whoever else got traditional business analytics application going continue keep proprietary enterprise data warehouse , keep investing one one correlation . however , see going start supplement edws next-gen data warehouse going based spark based hadoop based , 's next-gen application development data going fed . clearly company like teradata oracle acknowledged going happen , therefore trying offer -- edw supplier come investing next-gen data warehouse , want maintain installed base . -- would rather vendor -- buyer come versus go something else . - mandeep singh - ashish nadkarni - mandeep singh - ashish nadkarniso offering connector allow oï¬ „ oad ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) data edw next-gen data warehouse get . initial play going edw traditional workload , next-gen data warehouse next-gen workload . next-gen data warehouse today also going become tier 2 stack archival purpose , everybody know enterprise data warehouse expensive [ ph ] . -- 'm going spend whole lot money doubling edw capacity , 'd rather spend money doubling next-gen data warehouse capacity . short medium run , think installed base probably , okay . also realized n't invest next-gen data warehouse , honey journey going come towards slow crawl , eventually trouble . another audience question , 's asking , big data adoption industry , industry lagging behind ? know , think industry lagging behind -- let 's , let start saying , see big data analytics pretty much go span across industry , industry acknowledged deal traditional go-to- market mechanism . traditional go-to-market mechanism , even take telco industry , really -- traditional telco industry much disrupted mobile internet thing new , upset newer mobile operator like google facebook entering fray well . even traditional industry , closed industry ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) started accelerate big data initiative . would unfair say , industry lagging , mean , clearly might -- heavily regulated industry probably one might pause investing lot big data vis-a-vis current investment , know , enterprise data warehouse enterprise business analytics application . acknowledged need dip toe big data start jump journey , going eradicated short amount time . okay , fair enough . think cloud help facilitate migration term legacy data warehouse next-gen warehouse , cloud role play , expedite transition ? mean certain company still using mainframe , obviously n't really moved big data environment , n't even close . cloud help company get faster ? - mandeep singh - ashish nadkarniso cloud definitely help , think help two way ; one , company traditionally run , rigid , time consuming , alternative go quickly jump cloud start test water big data . way help , company like amazon invest turnkey big data solution , -- company start avail service without build stack ground . third way cloud help , offer quick , , trying new thing . might otherwise hesitant test , test quickly without touch bread butter infrastructure . without risk . mentioned something mainframe seeing people hesitant mainframe , ibm fact bringing big data mainframe . know tracking ibm , last week announced machine learning z system . 'm told machine learning z/os customer , 's linux customer , 's z/os customer . , clearly ibm recognizing , mainframe ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) n't get big data experience directly mainframe , 's going , effect alienate installed base . , smart bringing big data mainframe . okay , 's interesting . n't know could big data overlaid mainframe system . guess , ibm making possible , clearly interesting trend . wanted talk ai little bit . obviously , every company know often ai taken somewhat approach come developing ai system . think edge big data give kind capability come ai ai algorithm go really crunching data applying machine learning big data , n't really make difference . , let sort start untangling term use , often use interchangeably . , ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) way looking machine learning , artificial intelligence cognitive comparing one one three different aspect brain . brain , human brain amphibian brain , sort trigger driven . example touch hot stove , take finger away , know 's hot hurt , quick react someone poke , want quickly react run away . amphibian part brain , could almost compare machine learning . mammalian part brain , scale ability think basic pattern . 's artificial intelligence come , could compared artificial intelligence . ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) could almost compare human , human part brain , make u different amphibian , sorry , mammalian counterpart kingdom . - mandeep singh - ashish nadkarni - mandeep singh - ashish nadkarniso , could almost think three thing staggered stacked approach adding intelligence application . , look big data analytics , information , big data part could probably . 're providing big data information machine learning part artificial intelligence part cognitive part , information n't change much , way operate , analytics part change lot . artificial intelligence , 'm sorry , machine learning part operates big data , could binary kind yes kind algorithm processed , put artificial intelligence , data 're lot intelligent stuff autonomous car , drone , alexa , echo , siri could ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) artificial intelligence , lot pattern matching going lot processing going . finally , apply cognitive data , taking data different level , intelligence different level . think yet , mean , lot time people talk cognitive , really straddling machine learning artificial intelligence . cognitive would much reading data human able make advanced decision next . n't think 're yet . okay . wonderful . enlightening 'll end audience question . one question around study done roi use case big data traditional organization lot hype ? would able repeat question . sorry . study done roi use big data traditional organization still lot hype ? 's good question . believe answer , lot hype . study far roi interesting concept come applying industry organization , custom . roi even industry -- different company industry might different . 's lot custom . 's lot specific company try mobilize investment try get return . , answer , think , study emerging , lot commissioned study , bias towards installed base bias towards vendor . lot uncommissioned neutral agnostic - mandeep singh - ashish nadkarnistudies would truly try shine light challenge gathering roi realizing roi term -- large investment . okay . thank much . ashish , time . great , fact hardware software perspective , come big data market . think trend told u around blockchain kind delineating storage part versus analytics part use case talked , think audience would find really useful . housekeeping note , slide transcript available terminal well replay webcast . would also encourage everybody take look theme published big data infrastructure software dashboard , focused around vendor . think everyone would find interesting . , thank much , ashish , really enjoyed webinar look forward future webinars . 's , thank . pleasure . thank .
