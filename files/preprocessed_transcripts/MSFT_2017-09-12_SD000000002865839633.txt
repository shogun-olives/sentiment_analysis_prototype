's true whether 're person listening web . , lot talk . question answer thought maybe would start question 's actually specific oﬃce business . microsoft large . everybody know . know acutely , 've holding share '20s mid-'70s , 's amazing , amazing run microsoft last couple year . sometimes hard u outside appreciate change going microsoft since satya came aboard . know client ask . maybe could share , insider , think 've microsoft , 27 year , something like ? - rajesh jha q - karl emil keirstead - rajesh jha q - karl emil keirstead - rajesh jha q - karl emil keirstead 's right . observation organization energy , level since satya came aboard ? feel like pronounced change . 'd love hear view . yes , sure . mean , like mentioned , karl . came microsoft straight school many , many year ago . wo n't count exactly many . thing , course , -- always come clear strategy executing strategy ca n't overstate importance culture . satya , clear culture want see microsoft 's driven personal example . seen work carole dweck growth mindset . whole , mean , may seem superficial . really try live . try get senior leadership team live . idea always learning . n't start presumption knowing 's right . , , would say , large part organization . thing satya really driven strong sense accountability engineering team holding u accountable , revenue often trailing indicator work . engineering team take direct accountability driving user satisfaction usage growth . long 're working executing clearly strategy , right business also going happen . also way executed senior leadership team , probably n't see satya one-on-one often . mean 's always available , need . get together senior leadership team every friday , every friday . idea hard conversation done open . 's done team . 's done mindset always trying learn trying get better . , , easy underestimate impact something like . 's really borne great result . employee satisfied . people focused work feel pulling one , one leadership team . certainly feel outside microsoft starting attract fresh , top-tier talent , -- process stopped . check recruiter top-tier engineer , top-tier data scientist going , microsoft making list . 's great see . mean , 've always able attract talent . take look diversity talent able bring , folk different open-source framework , folk productivity , data , ai . feel great talent microsoft also talent already exists harnessing productive way . - rajesh jha q - karl emil keirstead - rajesh jha q - karl emil keirstead - rajesh jhayes . good . maybe let 's turn couple big driver going tech space today . know everybody audience following 2 certainly popping lot , last several year cloud . recently , ai machine learning . sure . cloud journey key part unit 're running . yes . transition traditional oﬃce business cloud-hosted oﬃce 365 one might single biggest thing going inside microsoft lot observer . maybe , diving exactly transition , 'd love ask , broadly , saas cloud adoption ? look result lot peer putting , whether 's salesforce workday servicenow , frankly , even saas unit inside oracle sap , feel like everybody , including microsoft , seeing stronger adoption curve , last year . talk client , rajesh , think catalyst -- feel like saas adoption picked acutely last year ? 's happening ? 's even occurring inside deutsche bank , 're publicly embracing salesforce workday well . think happening large ? 'd say , course microsoft 've cloud . good u , 's great customer customer take advantage global hyperscale enterprise-grade cloud . biggest payoff customer rate innovation cloud probably order magnitude , , faster . mean , oﬃce , specifically , seeing great adoption . would say , upwards 100 million active user cloud , commercially . across different platform , 90 million io android oﬃce user . seeing increasing usage core workload , exchange mail , onedrive . sharepoint yammer skype . also newer workload like team . , saas movement , mix shift on-premises cloud . oﬃce , -- think , shared data couple month ago , financial analyst briefing . oﬃce , 50 % commercial oﬃce within cloud . think fy '19 , 'll 2/3 commercial oﬃce oﬃce 365 exchange north 70 % . bit mix shift sure . also cloud many way democratization -- 's economy scale , obvious , also economy skill . today , many segment take sophisticated capability many vendor produce . 's hard customer go stand thing . able consume , even find capital q - karl emil keirstead - rajesh jha q - karl emil keirstead - rajesh jhaoverlay . deliver cloud , naturally start consume-as-you-go model , simple model . oﬃce 365 , starting see small business could n't really run lot capability like skype conferencing onedrive sharepoint . actually consume . emerging market , see thing . couple secular trend , economy scale , economy skill , course , device proliferation , consumption n't on-premises . consume device . yes . factor certainly feel like 're picking steam late . yes . rajesh , second one around , ai general , always listen satya . stage , 's always talking trend . enterprise spend ai machine learning , -- feel super early stage . think mega trend impact oﬃce business ? might customer apply ai oﬃce , instance ? well think ai going pervasive . starting already oﬃce . every single day , ten billion signal come cloud , user use oﬃce . signal actually belong customer . n't belong microsoft able take signal give value back end user customer , , work ? document look ? going meet next ? 's trending work group organization ? message ﬂowing system ? signal . today , take look , let give couple example . take look powerpoint , point end user digital designer cloud , working behalf , telling right content . 'm actually producing content , know relevant content enterprise process linking reusing . help picking right design template , getting style right word . powerpoint , , like , workplace diverse globally co-located . powerpoint , n't know guy seen recent demo powerpoint translator . could talking . real-time transcription translation one ten language . word , 's like professional editor , cloud , working behalf making sure content professional , tone gender-neutral , 's geopolitically appropriate . excel , throw something like country label . tell excel , `` hi . recognize entity . '' go cell next . type gdp . excel auto populate gdp next . n't treat like text string anymore . tell treat like entity . q - karl emil keirstead - rajesh jha 's neat . outlook , ai know work ? close , organizationally ? prioritize focus ? spending time correctly meeting ? send note , karl , saying , `` send deck yesterday ? `` , outlook soon suggest deck might . right-click . 'll detect natural language query . right-click suggest right thing . n't get right , 's signal back u . billionth signal back u , get relevance correct . end user , ai working end-user . professional , see signal ﬂowing cloud oﬃce . see signal ﬂowing window , enterprise . see signal ﬂowing directory network . 're able triangulate signal . suggest siso , hey , pattern look suspect maybe want turn fa set folk , encryption policy set folk . mean , could go . think ai going incredibly pervasive . ai capability going existing product make better . ai capability . 've got thing called -- 's , 's early preview right . something called workplace analytics . , think value-added service add oﬃce 365. , workplace analytics ? talked ai , end-users , ai . workplace analytics people decision maker . leader organization , hr , sale professional . 'll give couple example . last year , bought 3 company . obviously , 's top mind `` hi . company acquired , getting progressively integrated , rest team ? '' workplace analytics , , take look communication pattern group people , collaboration pattern , meeting pattern . sure enough , found one three actually starting drift apart . easy go get right process connection place . one customer , early customer work analytics , discovered correlation salesperson eﬃciency directly correlated size internal network . much , much time spent customer , matter . much size internal network . reorg around core factor . ai going permeate , think , existing experience , generate new capability . start fact data , high-quality signal , 're able iterate quickly , loan experiment get right relevance , create value back user customer . 's cloud much , inherently , way , 've on-premises model , ai model , machine learning model , iterated , personalized , creative . nothing 's annoying assistant getting wrong . even get wrong 1 3 time , lose trust . ui done tastefully . . mean bullish , term generating user value customer value , ai existing infrastructural oﬃce . think linkedin data set . think fact 0.5 billion people . people 's rolodex linkedin . follows . speech click work context . yes , ai 's going big . q - karl emil keirstead - rajesh jha q - karl emil keirstead - rajesh jha q - karl emil keirstead - rajesh jha 'm excited see ai trend affect microsoft , going forward . 'll watching . 're , karl . sound like . let 's zoom , maybe broader theme , cloud ai , zoom little bit oﬃce . sure . inside microsoft , roughly $ 25 billion business . think standalone , 'd probably top 5 software company . growing 6 % , past quarter , -- least , commercial side . 's terrific growth rate . rajesh , run couple key growth driver oﬃce . 'm sure 've got continued seat growth , ubiquitous . got arpu growth maybe driven transition newer version . 's driving commercial growth 6 % ? 's said , karl . mean 's seat growth arpu growth . get , let share think foundational , anchored mission oﬃce . oﬃce , want empower every individual , every organization succeed . whether 're work context , home context , whether 're school . really grounded , actually , creating experience product people love trust . want enable communication , collaboration , creativity letting people work anywhere , work cross-devices . started mission like . take step back . first thing , would say monetization oﬃce . get people engaged product love , trust , right thing , earn optionality monetize . without usage , without earning trust love end-users , option . start -- grounded . rebuilding right experience . oﬃce , going take advantage , ai , talked . also natural user interface increasingly , mobility pattern . stopped think oﬃce , relevant different segment . one arpu driver u -- mean , letting , actually seat growth driver , let 's -- , like said , 50 % commercial oﬃce cloud oﬃce 365. fy '19 , think 'll 2/3 way customer transition cloud . 's mix moving cloud on-premises . oﬃce incredibly horizontal product . think , small business want oﬃce , term q - karl emil keirstead - rajesh jha q - karl emil keirsteadproductivity , communication collaboration . go market like kenya indonesia india , people 's device -- information worker . device going phone . oﬃce mean user ? think baggage attendant , working airline , folk work corporate oﬃce , need understand today . worker fast food restaurant , 're baggage attendant , baggage handler , 're cleaning staff hotel ; oﬃce mean folk ? 've started create new service , 've launched microsoft kaizala india , -- seeing -- mean , early reception 's good 'll launch emerging market . 've got frontline sku oﬃce 365. aimed -- information worker . 're thinking specific small business sku . we're adding value . 've seen seat growth , 's affordable folk . n't need capital overlay . importantly , 've got right product right service . see expansion seat growth , overall . remember analyst briefing couple month ago , oﬃce commercial seat grown 8 % . 's movement cloud , overall base expanding . yes . 's amazing , ubiquitous oﬃce , 're still growing seat count clip . oh , yes think -- stop think billion people first- line worker front-line worker , small business never able afford run oﬃce . 's lot . , term arpu driver , first user moved on-premises cloud oﬃce , wanted professional-grade e-mail exchange online outlook . like said , started get engaged , started use , 've started increasingly opt hero sku , e3 , messaging calendaring . document storage ; modern intranet site , work phone sharepoint ; conferencing skype ; yammer . 've added microsoft team hub collaboration . last 2 three year , 's great see uptake sku . customer moving cloud , one workload . increasingly hero sku . know , 've added e5 , advanced security compliance capability , 's got phone system cloud , business analytics cloud . early momentum e5 great . , workload e5 , 're going see longer sale cycle , thing like pbx cloud . 's -- existing vendor contract worked . advanced threat protection , lockbox , conferencing . super easy customer switch . drive arpu . thing would say arpu microsoft 365 take user centricity oﬃce 365. 're thinking entire need modern workplace , bringing management cross device em . window 10 enterprise desktop . 's going one arpu driver u . - rajesh jha q - karl emil keirstead - rajesh jhaokay . rajesh , transition 365 , mentioned commercial side , microsoft already transitioned roughly 50 % commercial base fiscal '18 . long think might take get 100 % ? ever get 100 % ? customer yet ﬂipped oﬃce 365 , frequent , sort , 2 3 objection keeping on-prem , sale team chipping away slowly 'll eventually get . ? holdup ? yes , 'd say , like said , fy '19 , think 2/3 oﬃce base going cloud . messaging , like exchange online outlook 70 % , something we've ( backed hard ) . running year ahead thought would two year ago . go back , n't know , shared exactly . internally , think running year ahead customer ' transition . term , customer eventually move cloud . given installed base diversity regulatory context customer ' ( inaudible ) existence , think 's stretch say . tend -- like 2/3 customer . 's bit carrot , . move cloud , get much faster rate innovation ai ml go run see signal . term get way customer , would say regulatory issue public sector , 's important . see microsoft cloud , , intentional market make sense . think one microsoft cloud . azure , dynamic , oﬃce , business case together . go country ? much public sector unlock ? thing make difference . bank , global . well know , 've got certain consideration work . chipping away . want serve customer best . think way cloud . n't mean going stop on-premises product . opex investment make today engineering , billing cloud , billing on-premises , 90 % , 95 % shared . yes , 's additional test burden . going support customer . whether 're on-prem cloud , want make really attractive move cloud . humble blocker 're chipping away . yes . good . 'm sure 'll get . let 's talk little bit adjacency around oﬃce , oﬃce actually act accelerant . one know topic -- mind everybody , azure , 've amazing success microsoft . feel like 's -- 's synergy transition oﬃce 365. even mentioned internally think one broader microsoft cloud , although reporting purpose , 's quite separate obviously . feel like self-reinforcing trend . word , customer make leap cloud-deployed oﬃce probably inclined use azure . 'm sure 's great cross-sell . mind describing synergy , starting azure ? q - karl emil keirstead - rajesh jhayes , sure . mean , first , would say , engineering perspective , scott , plan together term data center footprint . build data center . build edge . networking investment customer , expectation u anyway . come cloud , end using -- remember correctly , 90 % customer today , 90 % fortune 500 customer use least one cloud microsoft . interesting thing 60 % use least 3 cloud microsoft . pause second think , look , use oﬃce 365 , 're going want protect directory . 're going protect device use enterprise management suite , enterprise mobility suite , yammer . 's exactly would use protect azure well . dynamic oﬃce 365 , integration , whether web launcher integrate whether 'd outlook , trying extend business process dynamic , would use power apps ﬂow . 's exactly would use extend oﬃce 365. go sharepoint . create business oﬃce , workﬂow front end , power apps , right data , back dynamic . thing contriving . thing customer naturally asking . started use oﬃce 365 , sold em . start using dynamic 365 , want better integration oﬃce . think reason 60 % fortune 500 customer use least 3 cloud microsoft 's natural synergy . yes , got . -- maybe linkedin side . think may 16 announced deal . n't think got closed till later . microsoft largely left linkedin alone , feel like . synergy story 's pending , rajesh , look forward ? either go-to-market product integration ? way 1 plus 1 equal 3 oﬃce plus linkedin ? yes . continue , excited linkedin . first priority , like said karl , continue grow engagement -- engage user member linkedin engagement , mean , ﬂywheel feel natural momentum . want keep growing . think linkedin oﬃce , 's talked time acquisition . bring linkedin identity profile , together oﬃce identity profile . know meeting , trending document , trending -- people work . linkedin context . bring profile linkedin identity experience together oﬃce , oﬃce outlook . thing seeing coming shortly .
