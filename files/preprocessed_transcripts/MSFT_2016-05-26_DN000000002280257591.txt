okay . good morning , everyone . 's great morning . 'm going spend time morning talking perhaps one pressing issue time industry , cyber security . fact , look history computing history information technology , starting start -- started store data , transmit data communicate , 've always attack trust . mail came mail fraud . telegraph , radio television came wire fraud . internet , cyber crime . time faced , 've come together collectively individual , company , organization government respond , use technology able respond challenge . 's 're cyber security . today , want talk microsoft 's contribution , microsoft's approach . start talk cyber security , want first start microsoft's mission . mission empower every person organization planet achieve drive technology innovation agenda , interact customer , show customer , partner broader ecosystem . drive everything . trust core . mission , -- mission capture optimism future . optimism digital technology play positive role every walk life every sector economy . n't aspect life , entertain , commerce , educate boy girl , n't part economy retail healthcare energy using digital technology today drive innovation transform . become core tech industry core every industry . customer going use technology ca n't trust . 's trust u central mission empowering every person organization . 're taking principled approach strong commitment make sure customer trust digital technology use . four pillar . come privacy , ensure data private control . come compliance , manage data accordance law land . also transparent collection data us data . lastly , ensure data secure . four strong commitment make everything , product , service , work customer , proactively reactively . 's grounded four principle . today , want talk security cyber security . fact , 's year -- even 2015 tough year around cyber security . top eight data breach led 160 million data record compromised . fact , one biggest challenge face time detect intrusion , 's something like 229 day intruded versus know start respond . cost term lost productivity lost growth really add . 's estimated 's something like $ 3 trillion . , global economy challenged growth , really huge issue u collectively . question , microsoft going responding challenge approach ? talk approach , want start describing changing environment . time could talk environment strong perimeter around , could talk data , application , computing end point secure within four wall environment . last two decade , taken advantage connected world , connected economy . 've extended network touch customer directly -- could business-to-consumer e-commerce business-to-business e-commerce . thing like customer relationship management customer directly electronically connected u . we've optimized supply chain , inventory level throughout supply chain constantly updating connectivity system . stop -- stopped . fact , last couple year , 've increased pace connectivity . increasingly looking public cloud service infrastructure , infrastructure service platform service . increasingly turning saas application mission-critical business application crm , erp . given pace change fact , one thing also , incorporating device owned employee inside network . letting people bring phone , computing end device environment . course , set even explode internet thing , computing going ubiquitous , 's going -- general purpose sensor going every room , every conference room , every living room . therefore , live world attack come anywhere . attack vector come anywhere . attacker lot sophisticated lot organized . 's perimeter-less world , 's world constantly evolving , 's dynamic , 're constant attack . 's environment deal . one thing drive u kind solution building talk today pretty unique perspective . today run biggest internet service , consumer side thing like xbox live , well business commercial side service like oﬃce 365 dynamic azure . give u pretty unique perspective 's happening , great sampling 's happening term attack vector one responds . example , update window billion time month . billion device upgraded month security patch , compatibility , make sure ecosystem remains vibrant . run world 's largest anti-malware , antivirus service part window . also inspect 200 million email part oﬃce 365 service malware . 're looking attachment may malware associated . take , detonate , inspect deliver inboxes people . fact run gamut service spanning consumer commercial . 's , key think two aspect service reach consumer well business-to-business service . need able think intersection , need able sampling traﬃc really help get visibility aspect . something order 300 billion authentication every month see , identity consumer business see network . , unique perspective helped u develop different security posture inside microsoft . fact , 14 year ago , bill gate wrote trustworthy computing priority microsoft . made tremendous amount progress . changing environment 's longer code threat modeling testing , fact operational security posture constantly evolving environment , constantly attack environment . operational security posture start . 's like going gym every morning . every hour day need prepared . mean exercise operational security posture continuous basis . framework protect , detect respond u many year . new posture . example , protect longer computing end point application . 's . 's computing end point , application , may inside premise , cloud service 're using , sensor , hvac system datacenter infrastructure . everything sensor datacenter part environment need protect . come detection , 's longer , example , waiting detect signature coming response deploying remediation . moved much behavioral approach detect based behavior attack vector . come response , perhaps area going sea change term respond , we're using transformation service base , even window , think window service ensure compatibility security window end point continuously . oﬃce 365 service mean 's longer giving tool 's actually ensuring security data , tenant service . n't -- 's limited service run . fact , knowledge gain something share broadly industry customer , 's going take u come together combat . operational security posture perhaps biggest sea change inside microsoft get u come new solution , new technology turn help u really secure environment . approach taking three key element . first building comprehensive platform able run loop protection detection response . second , complement intelligence fabric , operational security posture , well set proactive reactive service field help secure environment continuous basis . lastly , partnering broadly , partnering rest industry , know n't live isolation , heterogeneous environment , need operate within . come platform , one thing personally sit security review meeting every month look incident . fact , every time incident , call ceo company issue , ask two question . help , learn ? 's posture need take start operational security focus . helped u ground real incidence , real attack vector , mobility attack vector , response come . want walk today 've built platform resilient attack . accidental data loss , perhaps one biggest issue , especially bring service bring device . 's unintended many julia whitecases , devastating . help get control plane allows avoid accidental data loss ? phishing attack , social engineering perhaps one biggest source attack vector , deal . malware continues big issue . 's 's getting much sophisticated term malware show computing end point , email . pas hash , take access one account access others ? , course even core hygiene , sometimes take granted , important , start operational security posture , recognize often issue deal lack patching lack strong credential . 's important u improve technology security posture around basic . security platform building across product , felt great julia white come onstage give quick run capability platform . julia ? thanks , satya . , satya spoke different type security threat . i'm going show built-in microsoft technology , working partnership security ecosystem , help address threat help achieve new security posture satya spoke . , 'm going first start talking protection technology around identity theft , certainly big area . today , user ' identity stolen misused unprecedented level . solution frankly move away password completely . point , really choice smart card similar type technology . unfortunately , user experience , cost complexity barrier broad adoption technology . well , window 10 passport 've addressed issue giving smart card level threat detection capability protection , using device first factor authentication , making simple , simpler card , second biometrics , using window hello . fingerprint , facial iris . , clear , front end password like device give , actually password replacement , 's big deal . , surface book 's set window hello facial recognition . i'm going step front happens fast , watch quickly authenticates system using biometrics . like , incredibly simple user experience , yet secure traditional password . , microsoft 's also working enable technology industry standard . 're working fido alliance , support company like amex intel , able platform benefit type technology future . , certainly beyond hardware level identity protection , also need secure manage identity around saas application 're increasingly using . azure active directory come play . enables single sign-on 2,500 pre-integrated saas application , well let integrate existing application well . enables conditional access , enables -- let preconfigure apps require multifactor authentication , determine based user , app type even device health . 'll show look like . go , app portal , excuse . see bunch different saas apps use . 'm going go sale force . , 's set multifactor authentication , 's going prompt phone call , look , see 'm going get phone call phone right , 's set preconfigured fashion . , get phone call , 'm going answer push pound key say acknowledge request . n't , 'd press zero automatically report fraud organization directly . logging phone . , 'm going switch talking protecting identity moving protection malware . , know email continues primary place malware come organization . satya mentioned , scan 200 billion email month , looking malware within oﬃce 365 course look known malware , 're also looking unknown malware , also known zero day attack . hacker unfortunately discovers vulnerability 's patched . , , course newer attack coming actually link email come legitimate , 're updated fact become malicious . time-of-click technology increasingly important protect malware . let go outlook experience , email number different link , one malicious , updated fact 'm going go ahead click show experience . , click , satya spoke , take link , actually put detonation chamber , conduct analysis , behavioral analysis , looking characteristic might make malicious , thing like executable elevated privilege -- looking elevated privilege device . see , take user page let know i've protected important , right , employee know what's happened , mean wo n't work around system take risky action well . 'm actually going call james demo support team get machine set virtual machine , actually , let switch . let 's see , okay , great , right . , moving email certainly security perspective , 're going go ahead move threat vector , course , downloading apps web another vector malware come organization . , show , different way , certainly done bunch work within window 10 , effectively generational step new technology called device guard . , 's long security around app control protect malware running -- running unauthorized application device . attacker gotten sophisticated , 've increasingly able bypass . , window 10 've actually leveraged latest virtualization technology , well partnering design level hardware stop hacker able run malware even gained admin level control machine . 's big shift . , show comparison 'm going look window 7 experience , look window 10 experience device guard . local virtual machine running , side website malicious app . trust , 's actually malicious . side system security showing . 'm going go ahead download app , never-seen-before malware , antivirus going detect . get prompt , i'm going go ahead accept trust system . unfortunately , malware gained admin level privilege , 's disabled firewall av solution . unfortunately , protected situation . instead , 'm going move open window 10 virtual machine system show device guard protection . scenario , apps 'm going download system security side . let go ahead run experience . 'll accept . device guard actually checking make sure digital signature valid , also signed trusted authority like microsoft organization . show 's , 's blocked . case i'm protected malware thanks device guard . , speaking malware , certainly need talk second pas hash . , 're familiar pas hash pas ticket , unfortunately enables hacker go single compromised device able penetrate multiple device across environment . , window 10 literally ending pas hash new capability called credential guard . , realize 's big claim , let explain work specifically . window 10 first time 're using hardware-based virtualization isolate critical window service authentication . new isolation-based architecture , 's sensitive window process secured , information well , using credential defended hacker , thus preventing pas hash attack . 's big step-function change making big leap around ending kind security threat . 've talked lot protection identity perspective malware perspective . let switch talk protection data loss , also big area concern . know people increasingly working mobile environment . mean need secure way enable experience secure way . intune , microsoft 's cloud-based mobile device management mobile application management solution part enterprise mobility suite , protect data across device . 're enabling bring device , whatever policy might place , intune us conditional access control ﬂow email corporate file going device based policy set . unlike legacy mdm vendor might using require deploy cumbersome hardware type thing . intune cloud service really ready support new security posture satya spoke . 'll show look like . personal iphone , want use work . 've gone simple step enrolling device . defined 'm able device corporate data application , like save information share information oﬃce device . let share look like . 'm going go outlook experience email get work done many u , enter pin , , managed secured app company . 'm outlook , email star attachment want get work done . 'll go ahead open . , word approved organization use business purpose . open . maybe case , want save personal dropbox account share . would unauthorized way , 'm going try anyway , maybe know better . 'll go ahead make copy choose dropbox account . try save dropbox account , see 'm blocked , approved method device . control . 's okay . well turn , 'm savvy user . 'm committed try share information even though 's stopping . instead , 'm going try copy information 'm going go back try send email , 's another way . go back . 'm savvy 'm actually going switch go personal email identity within outlook 'm sending personal user , trying create email . go 'm going try paste see paste option , 's blocked . 'm using personal identity , n't privilege work business data . 's sophisticated enough . go switch back work credential , permission send information go back paste , fact paste work . even within application identity level , decide n't appropriate work use protected sent wrong way wrong place . great example keep rich oﬃce experience people love able use personally work , still get right protection control perspective . also number partner done integration similar type experience . example , adobe box sap provide level control application phone . showed device enrolled device experience . enrolled mobile device management . 're also taking oﬃce -- outlook oﬃce app experience showed 're enabling without device enrollment get application management without device enrollment . make easy bring device adoption perspective simple . also mean run great oﬃce experience side-by-side legacy mobile device management vendor might place already . , 'm going show scenario , time , 'm going show window 10 built-in enterprise data protection capability . 's built-in , get nice , seamless user experience . also get granular control well . first , 'll walk , show authenticate , course , using window hello . let 's go . another use biometrics , let hold . looking . see , , better password , secure , , similar experience . window start screen . see little icon corner application approved business use . user see 's ok business use versus 's purely personal use , making simple . go file explorer , see go even file level , app level . personal document well work document . go ahead open work document , similar showed iphone , 'm going go ahead try copy sensitive information . let's go . case , 'm going try send unauthorized way . time 'm going use twitter . see n't icon . 'm supposed using work purpose , 'm going try anyway . go try paste , see time actually get pretty nuanced message . see exactly 's happening . case policy set go ahead send , 'm going monitoring action . course , block completely . 's fully configurable . see window 10 nice user experience get nice rich message , 's paste missing , well granular control around want manage , . talked protection capability right around identity , around malware around data loss . let 's switch talk detection , , satya mentioned , increasingly important , know great protection thing like identity theft continue reality . unfortunately specific case primary way hacker getting enabling breach . need able tool monitor protect identity attack happens . way essentially monitor capability learn normal authentication action , identify abnormal . anomalous happening , combine known threat . detect identity compromised , attack taking place . many , 's little bit like get call credit card . see abnormal behavior , think something . 's idea , applied identity way learning normal behavior detect anomalous behavior front . cloud , get azure active directory . 's filled right , heard many customer want level control premise environment . 's new microsoft advanced threat analytics capability come . 'm advanced analytics dashboard . essentially give timeline view different identity-based threat might want consider understand . essentially let know kind let get signal noise lot different authentication . let start . see bunch guess term looking user name . someone trying guess user name organization . go see 're using brute force attack get user name password . 've figured user name michael dubinsky unfortunately strong password look like , 450 guess 've secured password , well . go see 's moved yellow red , really important high threat , michael dubinsky 's user name password used sign number computer resource would n't normally trying access also number resource across company unusual user name password . , 's comparing normal activity learning able detect 's abnormal . scroll see , , high alert around pas ticket attack 's taking place organization . moment 'd really love new window 10 credential guard stopping action case right . new advanced threat analytics insight immediately go take action stop breach . remember satya said , number -- day attack happens sits network 200 day . identify right away opportunity sit network time . talked identify perspective around detection threat . let's also move infrastructure level talk detection respond level infrastructure . infrastructure continues move cloud azure , 've built comprehensive security system azure security center . azure security center provides central view security setting across entire azure environment , live monitoring security configuration make sure 's ongoing good security health . 're analyzing security setting even change bringing back policy-based recommendation , well guiding step ensure environment secure . 'm going take look . azure security center , click right , see number recommendation suggesting based security posture . go , see thing , action asking take . case 'm going choose adding web application firewall . go see actually number web application firewall partner integrated right security center . choose one like . case 'm going choose barracuda , web application firewall . go see actually right deploy solution azure environment . significantly streamlines process provisioning partner solution , well enables bring whatever preferred security vendor cloud simple way . addition partner shown , 're also working folk like trend micro , cisco , fortinet checkpoint , well many come around anti- malware , well next-generation firewall . recommendation great important , 's also identifying security alert within azure environment , well . next 'll go security alert . see number thing showing . go see different thing happening drill one within security center find 's going . case see sql injection attempt made . go , 's virtual machine one , luckily barracuda web application firewall deployed protecting attack , fantastic . let go see else going . see traﬃc going virtual machine one malicious ip . , tapping intelligent security graph microsoft broad view malicious ip . identify quickly proactively notify customer 's going . within i'm also giving recommendation remediate security situation , well . right go fix , take insight , move action . great azure perspective cloud perspective . also know customer running hybrid configuration , meaning infrastructure premise , private cloud , well cloud maybe aws , well azure , course . want kind security view across entire enterprise estate . 's operation management suite come play . 's powerful new solution collect massive amount machine data across on-premises datacenter , well cloud , brings together search , correlate visualize massive amount data detect security threat across entire estate cloud on-premises , well . example , could use operation management suite identify , virtual machine datacenter communicating malicious ip . notice azure look across entire organization find , well . 've shown example microsoft 's built-in security technology , working partnership security ecosystem across globe tapping satya nadellainto intelligent security graph help make customer safer . 'll turn back satya . thanks . thank much , julie . thank . give good feel depth breadth technology building core product . fact , spend billion dollar r & year building security mainstream product , window 10 , oﬃce 365 azure , n't think security separate piece technology . core operational system use data resides , critical application usage . , fact , built three product work well . think something like conditional access build capability device . build capability oﬃce 365 service thing like active directory . also recognize u building technology together , also need interoperate heterogeneous environment . that's something 's first class deal identity , deal device management , deal data protection . key design , key building technology . fact , window 10 , great technology julia showed device guard credential guard , microsoft passport , window hello , core security technology . fact , virtualization infrastructure coupled make window 10 secure operating system . last week , big update window 10 , also added management capability , great performance , combination performance , world-class management security make window 10 ready deployment enterprise situation organizational context . 're excited window helping u move new frontier eﬃciency come security . come azure , two capability julia showed , think , critical . one , encapsulated inside enterprise mobility suite . brought together new control plane brings identity management , device management data protection together , control plane becomes critical handling accidental data loss , conditional data access , conditional application access current world byod device , well bring saas application . em perhaps one strategic security product microsoft really help enhance security posture inside enterprise . side course , operation management suite , around infrastructure , limited , , infrastructure u azure , true hybrid infrastructure , manage security around virtual machine , container , irrespective , estate , premise , azure cloud provider . oﬃce 365 , building security core product service . advanced threat protection service give capability able detonate enclosure detonate attachment deliver inboxes . lockbox give capability secure data , encrypt data give key access required . building rich technology core product . 's refer platform . , second aspect approach intelligence aspect , 's technology deliver , platform technology coupled intelligence . 're building intelligent security graph . historically 've always something called digital crime unit , worked law enforcement fighting cybercrime , bot-nets , many issue vulnerable population , child older people , face come cybercrime . worked many industry law enforcement fight . 're even bringing together operational security people across company , people running everything xbox live oﬃce 365 , azure , window update , window defender , bringing together one operation center . call cyber defense operation center . like intelligence operation , n't silo . actually people able real time connect dot 's happening across service . operation center output operation center intelligence graph used turn product create security product . share intelligence broadly customer , partner . , fact , stopping . also putting resource right field cyber security specialist proactively reactively work customer using product well intelligence help secure environment . said , partnership key everything . microsoft . u working together ecosystem . fact , digital crime unit well cyber defense operation center , use lot third-party technology defend estate . want interoperate tool . want able take advantage one partner brings collectively secure environment . new approach , new platform , new intelligence new partnership . start new posture operational security .
