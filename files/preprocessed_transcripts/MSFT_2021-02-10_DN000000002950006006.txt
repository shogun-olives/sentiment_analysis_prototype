's shifting way focus prioritize type project . seeing n't take digital transformation step forward invest area . 're going struggle continue remain relevant sort shifting market . corey sander kash rangan corey sandersgot . could put final point , kind project getting prioritize versus iq budget certain financing review , may grow something , got eliminate grew something else . going ? coming ? given broad perspective running commercial sale company . yes . well , think focus leveraging data insight sort remote environment feel like 's sort broad brush really big shift company . many many company deal silo data , deal individual business unit sort data , analytics , sort assessment . company needed figure going next revenue stream ? going area pull back ? going re-prioritize ? focus consolidating data thinking analytics fully end-to-end drive outcome . 's really big area focus . think 's something we've seen whole lot attention brought . , think sort layering sort take data drive sort digital-first remote experience . taking sort data able improve way people engage day- to-day environment improve sort way , sort auto manufacturer run assembly line , listening device assembly line able support remotely service assembly line digital way . place getting investment getting lot attention people look shift almost sort cloud service 're depending upon . got . , suppose 's positive analytics business intelligence , rbi kind product , right ? . yeah , definitely , sorry . definitely . talking broad stroke , let talk specific microsoft . yeah , mean type product really support certainly team collaboration really big major one right , obviously everyone sort shifting collaboration experience analytics , like said , sort able take analytics , also ai service built thing like dynamic , taking advantage customer insight able draw conclusion based business outcome 're looking pulling single data source . big area sure would probably maybe add one security . something 's seen huge level investment think , perhaps one satisfaction pandemic outside pandemic 's become opportunity bad folk take advantage many customer many challenging situation folk , investment security going kash rangan corey sander kash rangan corey sandersand need think opportunity secure environment endpoint infrastructure sort bring component together , 's really big investment area last year . got , got . look pipeline commercial business , let want characterize year-over-year basis sequentially maybe useful look sequentially , economy hopefully improving sequentially fairly rapidly according goldman sachs economics team 're calling u gdp accelerate 10 % q2 , highest forecast . look pipeline today , look relative say three month back six month back nine month back ? . yeah . really depends customer industry . right . like , think obviously breadth customer support pretty wide pretty differentiated . think know industry starting see rebound sort outlined sort seeing v-shape business , seeing sort combined sort point made increased focus digital transformation pushing lot energy excitement customer approaching business different way , willing sort take investment sort build dependency sort cloud-based solution , digital solution . , think across full breadth microsoft product , 's pretty exciting . think opportunity go help customer deliver promise . , say though really dependent industry , still industry hurting still industry trying figure next step . , one feeling sort rebound 've outlined think definitely showing lot passion go make digital change quickly . got . could corey look average customer profit average customer n't digital transformation microsoft . mean , 've got $ 67 billion , excuse , run rate business 34 % . product picking choosing microsoft family banner digital transformation outlook kind product going forward . yeah . know sort . already talked . , think maybe sort re-emphasizing go even little bit deeper . think data core component digital transformation . ai output service . , think sort key service , think synapse sort data warehouse , analytic solution around . seeing huge amount excitement attention sort data coming lot source . kash rangan corey sander kash rangan corey sander kash ranganright . , sort data silo trying break , bring together drive insight outcome . 's area think 've got lot passion . think sort feed , business . , think sort shift sort depending upon digital digital data sort digital lead like call . we're driving sale business suddenly dynamic becomes really interesting conversation sort categorizing customer using ai sort able engage customer using collaborative technology , also understanding sort right next best action using sort data pulled together . , think dynamic capability driving business outcome mentioned retail could expand supply chain could expand commerce , could expand sort dynamic suite , 're really seeing energy passion maybe separate category sort change way work . think , sort push even rebound state , even sort state vaccine becomes prevalent people start working person , desire engage much collaborative way ever possible team sort extension point team . meeting camera , right , sort meeting camera chat apps use sort understanding work-life balance recommendation around sort right tool using improve experience . chatbots help automate process think really coming together great opportunity customer looking . got , piece business everybody want talk azure . name azure come ? 'm kidding , 's question . color sky . think original idea anyway yes , exactly . yes , took people really start , know , real . actually real . , n't know remember ( inaudible ) presented u 2009 , talked azure first time put . talk ? well , 11 year later . corey sander kash rangan corey sander kash rangan corey sander joined team 2009. yeah , well , yes , exactly . yes . amazing , pick brain snowﬂake , used snowﬂake later . , want ask azure . azure look like know 's turn business quarter , ( inaudible ) quarter . 's big business , , 's almost generic ask driving reacceleration probably answered 90 % , wanted get low specific , causing reacceleration azure ? , sustainable terrific growth rate guy put . sort get true digital value customer sort digital transformation momentum 's premium service , 's new application development , 's synapse , 's able take advantage data break , type capability 're seeing real momentum around 's helping fuel , point sort longevity look 're 'm pretty excited growth 're seeing . 'd always catch mentioned , 's big business always , 've always got kind remember 's big business sort temporary outcome . basic thing aspect business every time speak microsoft , get sense growth driven new workload 've trying think 's migration . 's transition , take point lift shift right ? . much still around , 'm looking microsoft server business 25 year , 've got massive , massive installed base got big market share . right . ever start quarter . moving cloud point . yeah . 're look think 're definitely seeing , right . mean think see significant migration existing workload , window , linux , sequel right like 's microsoft core component , 's lot , lot exciting open source development migration , say well . 's definitely big component . would like said new workload sure . driving lot , incremental growth . know , think trade hybrid actually big selling point big value add customer . right . , hybrid story sort enabling customer think digital transformation , cloud answer right think capability like like azure arc creates sort unified experience on-prem kash rangan corey sander kash rangan corey sander kash rangancloud enabling run thing like current '80s sort managed data service place . allows customer make digital transformation step without boundary whether 're going public cloud . , result still buy on-prem addition growing cloud , 's , think great outcome customer . right . really sort n't sort boundary condition . n't sort limitation , take digital transformation way want think 's unique set offering enable customer see growth , right . 's something think get question , lot car growing 're server component right customer growing sort hybrid picture enabling seamlessly got . one point time two transfer going sort parallel cloud development on-prem azure stack still remember heard azure stack , early could brieﬂy , newer upgrading azure stack . 're seeing actually even positive business , still seeing lot on-prem business workload going microsoft longer period time make decision go cloud . 's . going benefit , right . , yeah exactly , mean think azure stack sort bringing , first component overall picture hybrid yet point , mean , really offering choice . really saying , look , n't 're picking sort sequel 'll use sort best example n't make tough decision cloud manage vms on-prem , 're giving choice able use sql ; however , want use wherever want use think 's value add point , 's going keep using sql . think bill , see value sort renewal conversation continue expand even usage sql , continue grow right one example type product . yeah . according 'd viewpoint database cloud , alone could 30-minute conversation . ( inaudible ) . love database . yeah , totally take . corey sander kash ranganmay talk 'm fascinated segment market , still big company , guy really turn business around covid cloud significant way 're seeing benefit important market share whatnot . prognostication get benefit computer sense undergrad person credential able viewpoint , see database cloud , microsoft positioned future could potentially ? . yeah , 're walking sort one favorite maybe topic . think differentiator azure , synapse link product . one thing sort go depth database challenge customer sort split data operational data . thing supporting website . right analytics , data rate , thing sort , running overnight 're sort deciding . hey , product put first page second whatever . 's retail example , go everywhere one biggest cost customer trying bring operational data analytics , data calculation run , like many customer year . basically every night , run big etl process cost whole lot money sector , think future database opportunity able one global scale database . 're longer spin one place . click button 've got seven place worldwide support website , synapse link , something recently announced allows database term effectively join operational data analytics data . , effectively run analytics query determine sort 's right product show page without moving data anywhere without duplicating data . basically hold operator . possible type cloud innovation know database going built deployed way , know analytics service going deployed way make connection behind scene save customer , time , money energy . 's sort point mentioned even beginning . one biggest silo data exist world unique solution . , got little bit bit byte , think , think direction database generally cloud going break barrier . 're going little manage , 're going little extra processing need done . 're going consider data one entity 're going pick choose value , want get want operational store . great . click go , want run query . click go little work make work together . anyway , got really exciting point . 'm sorry went long . corey sander kash rangan corey sandersthat 's great . , start partnering writing business cloud butter decade back . , 's great see segment , opportunity comparative market share gain displacement legacy database . something microsoft giving attention , 's big market ? . yeah , mean , think one big thing focus choice running think look sort modern capability , sort global scale . look something like cosmos db . 's built around open source database solution . , cosmos db , basically click button fully managed global database built whole bunch open source model go use allows easily move perhaps feel sort legacy database sort feel weight legacy data , 're able make migration cloud-based solution , aggressively think 're going see lot customer move digital transformation decide need global scale solution . 's hard manage existing one . think , 'll continue see legacy data base move infrastructure . think , making sure 're customer going key . earnings call announcement , company talked $ 10 billion type transaction azure microsoft 365 speak customer , thinking microsoft positioned cloud roadmaps strategic azure becoming roadmap cloud . yeah , mean , , 's sort depends customer , probably best , best answer . mean think customer looking partnership u , look fully left right across entire portfolio . right . , azure course key component azure infrastructure , sort data platform 've maybe talked ad nauseam point . key component strategy look modernizing , strategic partnership end building bring resource bear go support , build design type transformation extend beyond right . include team modernization , include application built azure exposed team , example . 'll frequently include dynamic sort business outcome based transformation well . 's , look , 's key component , think brings lot piece together , strategic partnership typically inclusive azure , maybe best way put . kash rangan corey sander kash rangan corey sander got . competitive market , mean 've got three big company addition microsoft . really pie becoming larger microsoft gaining share pie . think dynamic , competitive ? . yeah , mean think without necessarily quoting sort share number look . think movement digital transformation pushing many customer plan usage migration cloud , right . , think seeing overall opportunity continue grow , great . right . think think 's great customer . bullish think able customer . i'm bullish compared competitor 's sort n't want continue repeat point , think 's actually tied heavily fact 's , right think feel good head head come data platform infrastructure platform obviously . , place really , really compete well 're able paint picture full landscape microsoft azure change end end . think 's real , differentiated find competitor really struggle land sort similar picture , 's much piecemeal , key component obviously sort , mentioned , data sort business outcome , collaboration security actually really big one see sort security azure , combined security sort model work experience creates lot differentiation distinct value sort aad across , full picture competitor struggled paint similar picture . got . minute 've got left . wanted get thought oﬃce 365 inning transition old oﬃce oﬃce 365 maybe market , obviously , gotten bigger . thinking transition old versus new , would know set u aspect ? yeah , think probably couple key point . first one would , think 's sort , oﬃce 365. microsoft 365 , 's really transformed collaboration experience , right . think done really awesome job putting component together right .
