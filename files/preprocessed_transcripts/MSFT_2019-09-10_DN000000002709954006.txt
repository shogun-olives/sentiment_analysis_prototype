okay , good morning , everybody . thanks attending db 's annual tech conference . great seeing lot people know well , thanks coming . hope guy fantastic two day . one highlight , think , 've got pretty amazing keynote line-up . , start jason zander , head -- evp microsoft head azure , pretty special keynote . addition jason , 've got ceo vmware . 've got head salesforce's service cloud , fantastic line-up . let 's start microsoft , maybe jason , want give quick minute history microsoft ? think 've firm couple year , right ? couple , yeah . thank . 'm pleased . jason zander , evp azure . run product work 've got . obviously , azure , think 're familiar , public cloud offering . build course worldwide . support product , oﬃce 365 , xbox live , et cetera , course make available customer . great growth . 've actually microsoft since 1992. joined , still selling do 4 , window 3 new , remember . , 's little . team along way , one engineer created .net framework . ran ﬂagship visual studio developer tool product , stuff like , moved azure team 2012 go work satya nadella , evp division time . point , team everything datacenters software involved , plus silicon way crazy stuff like quantum computing . , kind dream job system engineer middle big inﬂection point , lot fun . karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zander -- know , ca n't comment size azure , 've put $ 13 billion , disclose growth rate , 68 % constant currency . , seriously almost unheard business scale growing 68 % . must funnest job . 's huge fun . mentioned , 68 % growth constant currency , 's really exciting . mean , fun thing , course , 're working lot company digital transformation . industry shifting speak . 're looking trusted tech provider , awesome opportunity build technology base trusted partner . , innovation agenda , really cool stuff industry , 's significant amount fun . yeah , well , 'm fun watching progress . , think everybody audience theme probably four year . . feel like azure starting get sea leg . 2015 aws first -- amazon first reported aws number , kind shock street start paying attention theme . , think span four year , everybody 's monitoring pretty carefully , n't degree visibility sort underlying trend . maybe 'll start asking look last , boy , six month , couple shift occurring . change occurring cloud infrastructure market significant 'd ﬂag group today ? yeah , think definitely continue benefit spending . 're definitely continuing see , company want accomplish two thing , really . one become much agile delivery business , 's important , especially entire industry start shift expectation change . course , 're tighter budget , well , need save money . , obviously value cloud kind hyperscale capability 've got , allows run workload . run far cheaper benefit . actually start cloud task 'm otherwise paying personnel . actually free budget , apply towards innovation agenda . , 're definitely benefiting continued growth come . karl keirstead jason zanderi think 're also seeing u land quite number large kind mega deal . 've seen u announcement , fortune -- top fortune 50 company , , looking microsoft trusted partner able carry forward innovation agenda , well . , thing driving obviously lot growth 're seeing , 's worldwide basis . satya said , think response question recent call , big & deal , subject chunky deal , 's got sort line sight . , think one microsoft talked 're public & . think chevron , walmart , walgreens couple big one . want address , feel like 's big change , last six month nine month , 're seeing $ 50 million , $ 100 million deal drop , 're seeing like $ 0.5 billion $ 1 billion multi-deals drop ? know , unique catalyst big deal starting happen , clear shift last quarter two ? absolutely . think 're starting see u deployed type technology , increasingly tier 1 workload , thing core business . obviously , significant amount work come like back oﬃce , know , work like , well . look kind tier 1 workload , run business . generally , see large deal , 're seeing u also integrate supply technology partner deeply . mentioned great , & , walmart , chevron great example . , case , look technology 're bringing bear , like said . would traditionally done , would operating system , like window server , sql server , exchange , thing like . , , running back oﬃce . course , . 's actually exciting growth area , well . start seeing much larger deal , 're seeing strategic integration technology capability skill set going along partner , 're world-class space , well . put two thing together , 's super important . think look transition lot industry , interesting hiring software engineer continued grow rapidly , 's isps like u . 's automotive company , 's fin sector , 's basically healthcare . folk hiring engineer technology becomes core part business . , think need kind structural advantage cloud edge . , frankly , case , might karl keirstead jason zanderactually wind competing cloud vendor , case hyperscale cloud vendor like u partner , 's necessity . yeah . jason , talked little bit big deal beginning trend 're hosting tier 1 workload . notion workload type azure hard one u outside see . sit customer ask kind workload 're running azure , aggregate picture tough get . maybe ask little bit color way , maybe sort traditional raw computer storage-type workload versus let 's say premium . portion azure might migration existing legacy workload versus net new ? cut give u help u figure kind workload running azure today ? yes . look customer journey around , interesting thing . born-in-the-cloud company . think one best one early jet.com , course acquired walmart , eventually also became partner u . , born-in-the-cloud startup go straight . however , look bulk business , highly focused around lot work enterprise . circumstance , mention , they've got existing workload . running datacenters leased datacenters long time . want better position capex , , want agility associated . , 's frequent 'll start level migration . take existing workload , get cloud ? get eﬃciency . run cheaply . , , get agility . , move innovation . actually think chevron top fortune 50 company , fantastic partner , forward-leaning company , started way . essentially kind enterprise control plane , software agility engineer could move quicker , -- start , workload . , sudden , three became hundred , hockey stick kicked . , got , started innovation , point 're iot upstream oil gas expiration , looking seismic thing , well . , moving beyond kind like sap portfolio bunch thing , first round , kind innovation side . , that's awesome journey , cool thing actually together along way . , team company came along ride . karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead yeah . jason , 'm sure happens , talked large fortune 100 customer , pick anecdote friction 're attempting migrate existing workload azure , aws , google cloud . comment migration pace ? feel like 's happening fast expected , slower friction point ? kind thing microsoft extent customer quote stuck get unstuck ? right . another one , oftentimes , really depend upon company . mean , example , leveraging partner , , example , si motion . 've got partner 's work . 've training partner year . really know make workload go . get migration done quickly . know run . 's mode , actually move quickly . finding lot company using move inﬂection point . case , want little bit clean . maybe portfolio made bunch & activity . maybe 've waiting figure work . 'm actually factoring process , really migration , around actually get right kind trajectory . , one 's actually interesting , case chevron , 's lot company also want work skilling personnel . , like , could come partner microsoft help move stuff quickly , personnel , yet come speed cloud operates , ca n't take full advantage . , case , actually want work along way , become cloud-skilled know move fast . , actually move quickly . , think 'm seeing lot company usually one kind playbook . speed vary , 's always technology friction , thing around , 's around goal firm , trying people , trying overall portfolio . -- tell , start opening gate stuff , man , 's hockey stick . ﬂoodgates open . first workload go , got people trained know , sudden , 're kind like , n't rest stuff running ? see usage start spike . jason zander karl keirsteadso maybe little bit migration pace everybody , affecting talk certainly yesterday , last week , 're worried thing like slowing economic growth , recession , et cetera . azure never period slow economic growth really started scale recently , n't material business back '08 '09 . 's hard u outside judge recession-proof azure would . one hand , 's source cost saving agility . would think company entering tougher economic time , could accelerate . hand , extent cost associated re-engineering workload could hold company back , 's hard pontificate n't case study azure going . maybe helpful maybe industry company azure serf stumbled . 'm curious reaction term migration activity ? story tell might help u question ? well , one thing , would look , course , point , every industry cycle 're always around macro kind recession sort environment . downturn particular area , take oil gas , take sort segment . industry , hit , oftentimes , really come back cost saving thing 're looking , oftentimes , 're starting evaluate capex . 're starting figure , gosh , really need -- like , renew lease 's coming . really want go ? , expensive . want , want actually reposition u go save money ? , able change balance sheet get laid thing occur actually important . , really come partnership like , 's role ? 's partner ecosystem 's role able help make sure someone realize ? end day , 're going agile , 'm going save money run rate , 've seen , large , company actually quite interested still making move . really bad spot otherwise . actually help . course , also service decade . oﬃce 365 , originally back first version bpos way back , 's like 15 year ago . , actually run service kind business model actually quite . 's true . thing microsoft , guess , accelerate migration activity , 're term partnership vendor vendor important part stack . extent firm sort wedded vmware technology . 've signed partnership vmware make easier port . 've introduced azure stack create similar environment on- premise . jason zander karl keirsteadwhat kind thing microsoft like accelerate growth ? suppose 're also making easier potentially cheaper migrate existing sql server , window server on-prem workload azure . 's probably important one . want highlight couple thing 're ? yes , absolutely , mention bunch good one . let split two apart , make sure frame correctly . think pat might next guest , 've partnering well . , let 's take vmware first , 's okay , we'll come back others . particular case , goal vmware hybrid operating environment u vmware also first class . , n't migration . example , 's like take vmware migrate instance . goal . goal instead partner vmware say , hey , existing stay , 've got people , personnel , asset trained vmware , let 's go partner together , benefit mutual customer greater u time 're . , 's first-class vmware solution that's , huge kind response 've got , amazing , mean use benefit vmware access technology relationship vmware , well azure , get better together kind solution . , ca n't enable hybrid solution . case really people wanting migrate workload . sap fantastic one . 've got amazing relationship sap really great momentum . mean , 've done really , really well . logged onto sapphire 's showing cool thing , lot case study -- coca-cola , bunch others like fortune 50 . , 's example software may running on- premise able run , 've seen people get 100 % roi . 've able reduce cycle time 40 % . mean , , like , cloud lends incredibly well . 's case migrating workload fully make ton sense . , 'll hybrid scenario integrate together . version 2008 cycle ? , one interesting thing everybody 's aware -- went end-of-life go end-of-life . , 're large enterprise 're facing decision whether upgrade sql server database window server instance , either keep on-prem upgrade latest version , maybe -- spirit question -- catalyst , actually , get thinking azure instead version upgrade . talk little bit 're seeing kind upgrade decision , sort , n't know , probably ca n't give u exact number , portion result customer saying , let 's go azure ? jason zander karl keirstead yeah . 's huge interest . point , end service , 2008 r2 , first thing would tell , actually sql server . window server . actually part team , part product portfolio 've got . guess ? run azure cloud top technology . best place run microsoft . , azure 's awesome place go . 're going consider cloud , make lot sense . decision making perspective , 's couple different thing . one , know need make move , right , end service , 's . need upgrade workload . question often get like get point 'm every couple year , move far ahead , 'm going coming back . 'm upgrade apply personnel order actually work . get better state ? , cool thing way set hybrid benefit . first , moving azure five time cheaper actually running two workload , window server , sql server , top aws . 's much financially viable able . licensing great . n't repurchase . get kind ﬂexibility 's . 's hybrid use benefit . time , also move evergreen state , basically say , hey , difference cloud , managed instance , actually keep date latest version database . way , lot thing 're hire people , like backup maintenance , stuff like , service cloud . , 're going get cheaper economics cloud move . 're going get eﬃcient system keep . evergreen state , sudden , 'm worry , take saving get 've never seen department n't work punt push backlog . apply resource onto . , actually move forward . , benefit playing , hard right . think microsoft fact ip , 've built cloud around top , 's awesome place go . 's financially viable , think 's actually great run rate maintenance perspective team . mean , 's 's appealing . okay . talk little bit competitive environment , jason ? jason zander karl keirstead jason zander certainly . imagine -- imagine 's rare , big chevron , & , walmart deal , many sole sourced . probably aws google table , anything , keeping honest . talk little bit 're seeing around competitive environment versus amazon google , seem swinging way , ? yeah . , go back look growth , 68 % growth constant currency -- basically constant currency q4 , , big deal . , we're seeing growth get competitive environment . two different dimension one . one , product work . excellent differentiation . hybrid work talked , work 've done edge . azure iot , awesome example . 're 6 trillion message day iot , 70 industrial customer . 's amazing . data analytics , 've got spark . one first party azure database solution . guy invented spark . kind tech , thing get azure , mean product differentiation . look broadly , 're able one thing , decade worth dna , especially enterprise go run business . 're probably already one customer , mean help journey . way , 're quite likely using oﬃce 365 , well . probably identity system active directory , mean nice network effect system line even better . even outside azure , 's broader microsoft cloud o365 , dynamic 365. thing help propel . one last thing competitive environment . lot case , 're also seeing lot interest 'm business . , 's weird would , one hand , go pay vendor go help cloud ; hand , would turn around compete . generating lot question . talk multiple people table . case , 's like might talking multiple people , 's one 's going , right ? 's going case would go pump money , weird boardroom conversation . yeah , spent hundred million dollar vendor , yeah , number one competitor , going forward , like 're going , case kind opportunity u come , , trusted vendor probably working , , karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zanderprobably 20 year , technology , investment . spent capex . want point able compete another stack investment , , 're going need asset , mean partner deeply . vertical focus , think , net favorable microsoft ? word , probably going relatively well retail environment ? well retail environment . obvious reason , hand , ( multiple speaker ) lot tech company rival microsoft might favor aws . , think net favorable microsoft , sound . think , net perspective , yes . especially start seeing appetite cloud company start expand industry , right ? , mention one , obvious , others , 's kind like point , start calculus asking , end , competing , maybe year , maybe five year . 's kind amazing see look like . need someone actually help . think 's come , 're seeing great momentum one example . okay . 'm sure , chunky deal , degree price competition severe . one thing 've worried four year , get three vendor duking deal , land infrastructure , might . incentive price discount huge . observation degree price discounting ? maybe could offer comment whether 're seeing little bit aggressive behavior amazon google . sure . yeah , 've seen case , course , early conversation since 've azure since 2012 , lot earlier one , like , n't think guy run cloud cheap , n't think , whatever , whatever , whatever . 's really shifted significantly . point , last four year 've seen growth , 's generally question , cloud , 's really like approach . 's way 's worked . mention , lot way , cost conversation went away reasonably early , , 're making decision , 're actually karl keirstead jason zanderlanding cloud 's already lot cheaper go run environment . , first comparison start even cloud vendor duking , also like , well , 's cost 'm already need . 'm already going wind saving money . , particular case , look , mentioned , like got big , hyperscale vendor , really competing going . well , one thing 're also betting 're investing heavily innovation around continue work margin , continue work cost , get eﬃciency . 're relentless work . , space , also think infrastructure , 's absolutely opportunity strong business 's . , buy million thing time , afford make good kind positive business structured way . , time , 's also move mix shift . 're going see little bit premium service . 're , right , talking compute , networking storage , basic intrinsics . start thinking , data analytics stack , also differentiated . ai machine learning piece come along top . , start getting , like , power application , power platform , et cetera , start business automation , et cetera . case 're going see premium mix shift continue kick , also contributes overall number 've got . look , broadly , business , 24 % growth constant currency overall commercial cloud business , broad , beyond azure growth 68 % . demonstrates like overall business , , keep mind , hybrid perspective cloud 'm on-premises , 've got product , allow handle . 's little bit report way . got . feel like three-horse race , vendor , ibm , cisco , hp , tried , ibm 's still , obviously , backed . fourth . oracle 's knocking door want part party . 're bidding large deal , jason , often seeing oracle table considered alternative ? generally , 've seen go hyperscale cloud , 's significant amount infrastructure work need . , typically competition often seattle competition . 's northwest cloudy city kind competition , often . oracle perspective , announce partnership oracle , 're happy . 've got additional thing coming , see great karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zandercombination . obviously , lot fortune 100 firm heavily bet oracle . 've got great solution 're trying go run top , course , 's want partnership oracle make go . think worldwide footprint , lot company deal , want everywhere . announced another region switzerland last week . new region germany . brings 56 region worldwide , kind global coverage , kind completeness portfolio , 's see people interested future look like . , , agreement oracle think 've got lot interest partnership , well . okay . jason , response question around pricing environment , one thing mentioned microsoft confined internal datacenter eﬃciencies could offset unit pricing decline . hit little bit , 's hot subject group , many invested supplier . , microsoft unique position day n't five year ago lot buying activity whole datacenter supply chain aggregated , couple company cloudy northwest part country . , 've got amazing purchasing power . , everybody watch capex , like n't five year ago . talk little bit , recently quarter two ago several supplier , intel one , many , seeing demand pressure claiming quote hyperscales -- hyperscaler buyer holding back investment , led consternation figure , 's true , anticipating slower azure growth , 're finding replacement technology ? finding eﬃciency improvement ? 've got stage ask , explain supplier pointing big cloud vendor , suggesting slowing purchasing ? would happened ? yeah . well , mean -- would start , , framing growth . mean , think growth speaks . 're ( multiple speaker ) obviously feel like growth . perspective , yeah , 'm still spending capex . 's like 've guided 're going continue spend capex . $ 5 billion coming quarter . karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zanderyes . exactly . , mean , amy 's kind discussed disclosed . , money 's . 're thing like datacenter expansion . mention two well . lot capex going towards additional expansion get market continue thing like . obviously , component buy server ﬂeet continue expand core part . mentioned , one thing pushing relentlessly eﬃciencies high scale game , mean really excellent job every dollar spend . product planning six- month semester boundary . every time , 's combination innovation bringing market , new thing , future going . always commitment team eﬃciency . , thing 've done particular , 've tuned supply chain . lead time starting shrink , get kind adjusting time , need , deliver , making sure 're meeting demand carry lot excess capacity . , 's lot improvement continue make . , 's like 're buying supply , storing top shelf six nine month , bleeding . 's correct . 's way time . yeah , talk amy month ask money , always remind , 'm yet , clear . maybe 've met amy . 's going keep honest one , improving , 're constantly working . , think , eﬃciencies get money spend , 're continuing make better better every single quarter . addition , 've made lot software improvement 've done . , better job density . host workload existing kit 've already bought give u even eﬃciency , well . essentially , plus , lot innovation across lot different part work . , think , 've seen spending capex continue chase tam . tam huge . , 're continuing grow . 've seen growth come karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zanderthrough . , 're working hard eﬃciencies part house , feel pretty good . okay . press much , n't want give away azure trade secret public forum , group curious exactly eﬃciency gain . like field check folk , engineer silicon valley , tell anecdote azure able squeeze like 3x server rack today versus 18 month ago . asked earth azure 's able , get vague answer . good . give u anything specific 're driving eﬃciency gain ? think everybody super curious . yeah . , tell element 're working , right ? , combination silicon design work . work closely component , partner thing like . think storage , think work 've done chip manufacturer , component go part cost , -- know , whole silicon team . like mentioned , everything azure sphere optic hololens , way quantum computing . , partner lot oems 're talking , component manufacturer . also lot specialization 's designed cloud partnership , actually help u good job getting even eﬃciency . addition , lot additional work , 's thing like sku mix , 's also , know , like much ram , much flash drive . well , turn running sap , server look like something . running gaming server , 's actually cpu , le disk . , 've able time look workload people running , get right mix -- little bit secret sauce , start actually tuning ﬂeet . , ﬂeet n't 100 % uniform skus every single node pull look exactly . wind right kind balance , end day , job really improve silicon utilization figure get great adjacency across workload actually share resource eﬃcient manner . karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zanderi mean , part mean hyper scale 's one thing that's big difference , well , 've got colo someplace lease , know , server , 's server . called fred , run sap . well , cloud , n't , right ? mean , 's literally million server able manage massive scale . , 's little bit trade secret side house get idea . got . okay , thank . talk security quick sec ? yes . , maybe two part . one cap one aws breach high profile . i'm wondering , 've interacted customer since , noticed change behavior ? sort pulling back wanting double click azure security infrastructure way could way elongate sale cycle ? , 's first question . actually , n't stop let go 'll ask follow . yeah , would say especially large even fin sector folk , know , healthcare , place compliance high , would say 've always , deep security vetting validation work 's . , see continue . , course , question around specific thing 've seen . case , 're thing slightly differently stuff like see . would tell big thing 've done security , 've running cloud service 15 year . go back oﬃce 365 , even xbox live , turn biggest hacking period get every single year december 24th evening . 's basically people unwrapping new xbox get guy like , want claim fame actually took network , people , whatever reason , kid could n't play xbox , 35-year old could n't play xbox , mean whatever happens look like , 's hack come . , 've long time , spend $ 1 billion op-ex every single year security . 's 3,500 people work . 've done significant amount work protect oﬃce , protect document . take thing , like trillion signal go system , apply window , apply oﬃce ecosystem , actually make available third party well . karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zander okay . , 's always lot scrutiny , security . especially true tier 1 workload start shift cloud , get extra scrutiny welcome 've got broadest compliance portfolio hyper-scale cloud , help . follow-up security , n't mean unfair amazon , 're amazing organization 're larger azure , nature 're going breach newspaper , search breach , feel like 's lot aws sort open s3 bucket problem , like might cap one . search high profile azure breach , n't many . maybe 's workload mix , 'm sure , market share , feel like 's disproportionately low number least high-profile hack azure . , wanted ask might azure judgement anything different aws secure data customer application . yeah , would say shared security perspective actually think cloud vendor , 're vested making sure everyone safe secure cloud . honest , get point people worry cloud general good place go , whether 's one vendor another , could problematic overall business , think 're dedicated . even 've major attack occurred , impact u . actually hotline google , hotline amazon . security folk talk figure . , think 's kind greater good . really trump competition around thing like . , come specific around azure , though , tell 're , try compare contrast per se basically say , mentioned , security work 've done run oﬃce 365 15 year built azure . get leverage tech 've built even top . put best practice analyzer sort thing frankly 've window server sql server 20 year . objective , mean , microsoft , faced security crisis past , long time ago . kind trial fire change lot karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zanderof practice work order able protect ecosystem . think 've learned lot accrued forward cloud cloud property technology . 's approach 're taking side . point , also partnership customer 's running workload , secure environment help tool make much , much easier , end day , also apply security best practice workload make sure remain secure . also , 're trying call pit success , like 'm trying design product , fall pit success , n't make inadvertent non-malicious accidental sort problem . 's kind part product design ethos 's well , 's got good partnership . got . might time sneak two , 'll go quick . gaming , excited gaming new azure workload anything azure infrastructure look , feel different google amazon might make microsoft slightly better chance game streaming cloud front ? yeah . well , cool thing gaming actually old/new cloud workload , 've actually running xbox live top azure long time . fair point . 're one first gaming service . 's massive gaming service . look going forward part , think really crux 're asking . game streaming awesome opportunity u . think especially start immerse 5g edge compute starting become prevalent . mean , 's awesome opportunity . we've already multiplayer game run online , run azure datacenters . go pop network get home . imagine happens get edge compute protocol device go handle . 've seen line-up announced e3 , cool streaming that's coming even phone mounted controller . one 's pretty freaking awesome . look thing 're online streaming , gaming karl keirstead jason zander karl keirstead jason zandercommunity , think 're seeing well . , 's lot content , lot video , lot sharing social . , 's starting evolve . 's actually built top awesome base , 's actually decade 's worth awesome innovation . 's cool thing microsoft , remember , cloud streaming , 've console long time , we've pc gaming back think first one played flight sim . anybody used flight sim ? remember microsoft golf , anybody play ? back do era . like , 'm damn old . go way back modern stuff . , 's actually really cool . okay . last one . 've got put forecasting hat . ir 's cringing right , know , jason , today hypothetically on-prem public cloud mix look something like 95/5 90/10 , n't know number guy use internally , look 10 year , 's on-prem cloud mix going look like ? think 're going continue see growth hyper-scale , see people move well , 's actually lot net accretive new workload . tell one really cool thing , though . hybrid since day one . , even mode 's mixture two , - - made hybrid standard solution competitor paying lip service . 's something 've since day one . azure stack , data box edge work 've done , even new announcement 've made , partnership vmware work 're , think 's first-class state company land . 're going see workload running cloud native running cloud 'm going able leverage existing system . honestly , fact 've invested since day one azure amazing , line u incredibly well . 've on-prem two decade , basically mean usage stuff kind move environment , 're actually great structural shape able handle take advantage . thank , jason , coming . 're honored able ﬂy join u meet client help think azure cloud business , fun ride 've . keep . perfect . thank much . karl keirstead thank .
