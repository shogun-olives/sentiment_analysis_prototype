hello , welcome fourth annual well fargo tmt summit . name phil winslow . 'm software analyst well fargo excited one favorite company . company joining u microsoft longtime tom fannon [ ph ] obviously , big fan azure . looking note . think 10th anniversary azure bowl , excited welcome julia white , corporate vice president azure marketing . julia , thanks joining u . 'm glad . thanks . question answer ( question answer ) cool . well kick thing . wondered could -- thanks everyone webcast . tell u little bit background role responsibility microsoft ? absolutely . 've microsoft almost 20 year , long time past six year , 've leading azure server product marketing . kind thing azure cloud service well thing like window server , sql server , visual studio , developer tool chain well . - julia whitefair . fun stuff , stuff love 's great conversation . guess 2020 , guy far . think back april fiscal q3 earnings call satya noted 'd seen two year digital transformation first two month pandemic , 're 10 month pandemic believe cio re-evaluating strategy whereby cloud substantially become no-go going forward least 's one-liner 've using . two question -- talk covid-19 impact azure ? evolved past 10 month customer partner telling ? yes . know wild ride least . mean , first stepping back seeing working customer already moved , cloud already done lot work around digital capability . super clear 've able agile , adjust , adapt 's happened . idea digital transformation important digital capability . think 've learned really matter . bit test , pressure test frankly whether 's proven true 's -- definitely seen term agility ability switch meet customer 's demand changing , definitely different . term overall trend 're seeing , one , lot urgency cloud . everyone cloud plan , -- like , n't cloud , 's urgency much bigger , right ? dabbling long plan , 're like bigger faster . 's certainly true . lot agility go scale , lot customer like , wish , could scale quickly movement . recognizing . lot cost management , cost optimized run server little capacity long run . lot type opportunity . also need lot better capability , thing like , real time analytics , rapid app development . needed cloud needed cloud . lot shift talk specific . think thing , people always ask like n't cloud adoption happen faster sooner ? 'm like , 's culture , like people , norm 's maybe dramatic thing 's changed covid , right ? around norm culture whatever reason n't want move faster kind blown away . 's -- think 's going one durable shift 've seen , continue increase durable time . course , say people like ( inaudible ) azure revenue going spite watching glad consumption take time . project start , whether 's migration , new approximately , start small grow time . , 's incredible strength long-term growth see increase project size project increasing go . -- think last bit 've looked different industry 're impacted , high impacted industry certainly cloud adoption fell , right ? cost optimized , thing , impact industry impacted absolutely spiked kind bounced q - philip winslow - julia whiteand 're actually seeing even high impacted industry come back normal rate 's starting see level . exactly . mean 're talking quote mike tyson , went mind , `` everybody plan get punched face '' 's sort feel like cloud migration digital transformation . plan , oh gosh , whatever plan need accelerate . guess least next question sort prioritization digital transformation . talk 're seeing project creation , project prioritization perspective customer , evolved . expect u evolve future past 10 month . price azure ? yes . 'll pull apart . 'd say couple thing change dramatically right away term prioritization . virtual desktop , right , service around window virtual desktop absolutely spiked everyone went home needed working remotely , along team , obviously microsoft team adoption virtual desktop team 's integration work together , saw grow -- project underway , become quickly number one project . similarly security , like always hacker never waste good crisis around covid , saw lot new different kind attack , different kind technique used saw bunch azure security , kind broader enterprise mobility security capability put place quickly . particularly remote work , everyone done network security , endpoint security needed place . certainly became top priority project perspective . third one within mix , suddenly became urgent around rapid business process change , right ? line business system , way 're work suddenly need involve really quickly . microsoft technology called microsoft power apps , take low-code way build application . became favorite tool choice whether hospital trying track ppe really quickly retailer moving curbside pickup remote checking ( inaudible ) check , type experiencing starbucks mobile pick app , able low-code way really quickly . maybe nurse hospital figuring process versus needing professional developer . , 's big push around integrating azure capability whether 'd data service ( inaudible ) service github power apps . beautiful kind professional developer low code experience based urgency . certainly big one . think question n't changed , maybe continuing strong pace analytics -- modernization analytics much underway underway , lot people still sitting old legacy system n't keeping covid put pressure , right ? people like used q - philip winslow - julia white q - philip winslow - julia whiteto fine . got 60 day 90 day old data , like way need like 12 hour data past forecasting model need evolve use analytics getting modern analytics continued quite strong , expect one actually even , continue accelerate move forward certainly hot area . steady run right business migration existing system , hybrid used case , think steady state certainly saw lot people quickly move back possessed recovering cloud , kind run rate migration cost optimization , super strong . describe two , gateway drive cloud disaster ( inaudible ) recovery business continuity , need risk mitigation perspective potentially use capacity . maybe cheaper 've done -- better . maybe 'll talk production workload . yes , nice cultural norm . 's culturally easy way kind start journey , right , common . exactly , 'm sure microsoft market perspective used gateway drug [ ph ] , analyst good ( inaudible ) switching gear little bit , ( inaudible ) still obviously azure . think investor always much solely focused sort headline azure growth number , always say 's much love , perspective , exciting emerging critical , underappreciated part azure portfolio ? yes , 's vast portfolio . love question . jump , would say though first , well everyone love azure number , important appreciate , right , overall commercial cloud business $ 15 billion last quarter grew 30 % thing want start azure core part world microsoft cloud . right , 's across microsoft 365 , dynamic 365 , platform github course , underpinning azure . think 're seeing u mentioned integration github power apps azure coming together create experience . seeing -- still provide integrated solution customer . think 's certainly something 's exciting emerging maybe still appreciated . three thing , really keeping eye towards microsoft cloud growth microsoft cloud experience . first thing might speak . within azure specifically , get exciting emerging underappreciated ? 'll break . 'd say let 's start critical , underappreciated azure sql . 's big business 's place customer really look u . thing 's strong 've taken , third year old database engine perfected secured 's on-prem , azure , 's even edge . amazing capability eï¬ƒciency . skill , system used anywhere build distributed application distributed system . 's certainly key -- key opportunity around azure . mentioned window virtual desktop vdi , ( inaudible ) huge percentage people 's existing data center footprint vi , opportunity modernize move capable platform , run cost effectively certainly big piece . kind underappreciated area maybe . think exciting category analytics , -- 's -- 's long time coming level like place n't modernized , 's moment moving true cloud native analytic system , seeing thing like azure announce [ ph ] azure power bi bring together opportunity actual business , fact , much -- like microsoft cfo care . much business leader care , unlocks organizational decision-making actually making much better informed decision , database culture . another area building would ai , right ? mean much opportunity 're seeing 's long journey ai 're , really seeing phenomenal breakthrough . looking latest image recognition technology kind , used go say `` oh , look two people talking webcast . '' literally say , age , gender , amazing thinking many different use case whether help working people visually impaired navigating world . really starting see responsible ai aspect , right ? transparency model data protection around model reducing bias category thing , think exciting one . emerging category thing keep eye future , would say mixed reality 's place 've long mixed reality like 've seen ai kind ... thing , something 's part every single application . expect mixed reality thing , right ? 's going element mixed reality , 's need mixed reality almost application get easier , cloud service make native device like hololens others expand , become accessible everybody . 's -- think 's underway long time . start see 's going really take . industrial side thing digital twin . idea -- kind next generation shift iot , right , connected thing essentially taking connected environment . whole system understanding system connected thing work together . optimize ? q - philip winslow - julia white q - philip winslow - julia whiteyou run greater inside ? understand overall environment that's connected part . last least , certainly , , massively profound quantum , right ? 're 14 year quantum computing investment amazingly enough 'll 14 year , building software language , development sdks , simulation engine getting ready quantum compute capability well . fact , saw ( inaudible ) head technology kick today . 's one thing 's talking frankly since got every time interviewed , sort increasingly excited , hey , quantum yet , 's getting closer sort pillar , foundational layer put place actually received white paper bank thing quantum could mean . , yes , definitely thought . okay , maybe . put azure number yet , 'm excited nonetheless . maybe 's interesting , even one , quantum simulation engine . 's running quantum algorithm classical computer cpu , gpu we're actually seeing like remarkable breakthrough working hospital mri recognition , like massive improvement even though 's simulating , interesting . yes , lot potential . yet number . yes , exactly , fascinating algorithm ( inaudible ) put category , stay tuned . -- obviously , walked broad portfolio guess follow-up question thinking invest , microsoft's framework growth operating investment meeting long-term especially context azure 's revenue . think see increasing investment area may see deep harvesting potentially ? okay . maybe -- ( inaudible ) back second . look overall azure total addressable market $ 4.5 trillion . like massive scratching surface . always remind ourself 's still ton growth core business , right , around compute system , like hybrid cloud solution , running big sap erp system cloud , high performance computing network security . lot growth , potential , investment frankly core part business still healthy , healthy part . increased perspective , referenced , analytics lot investment , machine learning , two evolving really maturing broad tam . expect get big work force overall move forward . new area like 've moved operator helping telecom communication operator , acquired metaswitch q - philip winslow - julia white q - philip winslow - julia whitefirm network , space well . big investment really helping segment , run optimize digital world . like industry moving digital transformation operator space . working right whether 's 4g , 5g beyond helping modernize . also kind increased investment area overall cloud native app development , lot organization tweaking modernizing migrating application , really , like , like need move full cloud native application , capability like container kubernetes , adding ai service application really meaningful way like , application n't leveraging ai next five year , 's going relevant . going deeper code drifting optimizing , certainly radar investment perspective . actually iot edge perspective . actually four year ago , announced kind $ 5 billion investment going spanned five year . 're coming tail last year . 's place belong well , ( inaudible ) three year ago coin like intelligent cloud , intelligent edge pattern . investment , think well ahead market , continuing important secular change . 's lot prioritize azure 's good problem high-class problem , 's -- 's many , 's growth opportunity going wait versus one going go big versus de-prioritizing per se . obviously mentioned edge , mean really wrote ( inaudible ) came well fargo , january , three half year ago . like , hey , think 's next platform shift coming . n't know 's called exactly . calling fog micro fog 's -- remember . sudden , like , 'm sure , 's -- think 's going big sitting build sudden intelligent cloud , intelligent edge , 'm like , yes , 's like first better branding micro fog -- -- like , maybe 're crazy , satya 's even stage , bill talking . i'm excited actually pointing network side . thought also going sort natural extension edge role 5g operator edge called cloud world kind glue . absolutely . yes , piece come together -- , right , yet . start see pattern know cloud edge 's really simple term application pattern q - philip winslow - julia white q - philip winslow - julia white q - philip winslownetworking capability make feasible interesting compelling way . yes . mean , actually already sometimes networking actually driver sometimes platform shift computing . think , client-server actually enable probably ethernet . 's connectivity lay driver platform . bottom , one , yes . exactly . work together . n't want double click something mentioned earlier , hybrid cloud , mold like mine 's offspin [ ph ] would say original board case 10 year ago microsoft -- amazing relationship . customer 's premise , also extending cloud azure portability called code , tool , process , people cloud . customer increasingly embraced cloud , think growth on-premise offering hybrid multi-cloud come play ? yes . 've stated , 've always held premise cloud , edge durable , right ? technology premise 's incredibly important , whether 's big server , whether 's small device , right ? continue invest server create modern experience , like example azure stack hci , window server based capability perfect modernizing on- prem system bringing on-prem footprint , like cloud capability disaster recovery backup type thing . bridging two world . actually made great stat 1/3 window server sql server enterprise customer using hybrid benefit deploy azure , right ? 's fantastic benefit give value software assurance agreement on-premises server , also give benefit cloud , right ? 's one capability aws actually five time expensive azure running window server sql server . 's huge customer benefit well . technology part , 's also business model part support well ensure customer value holistically . yes . one word think 's probably biggest change may impactful change best called 12 -- 24 month , word multi , simply hybrid cloud , multi-cloud future . couple question , seeing field top reason customer ' strategy shifting - julia white q - philip winslowto multi-cloud ? think implication azure particular sort defend mode world multi-cloud ? yes . multi-cloud new term . n't think 's new reality , right ? 's new term , 's marketing person like new term -- -- customer get ? get ? common thing . see acquisition , right ? one cloud strategy acquired different cloud strategy come together super , super common . level like , n't want one vendor . 'm going distribute cloud capability put lot . would say -- much bottoms-up , n't strategic decision multi-cloud . kind happened . developer chose . data science team like , tend project project decision . might run sap system one cloud data science project another cloud . based individual group , decided . mostly talked cio , ctos , kind happened discovered versus super intentional . look 's exactly on-premises look like . data center 40 year , like , hey , never homogeneous . lot different system , lot different tool , despite people 's best intention heterogeneous world always best breed , best kind dynamic . n't think cloud going lot different , right ? think -- think 've view frankly hybrid recognizes view everything wo n't sit one big cloud one . try take history really understanding hybrid , might working across different environment seamless fashion making people run two environment next 're multi-cloud . think great wisdom bring bear . -- infrastructure perspective , 've azure stack long time , literally bring azure infrastructure anywhere . , 's moved , software layer , may technology called azure arc , essentially enables software capability cloud run anywhere well . 's matching infra software , data service , developer service also move around . today exciting thing customer like great run on-prem cloud , like 's common . i'm starting see like , think , run azure sql different cloud compute . okay , 'll . -- lot different reason , reality enterprise customer complicated , lot nuance ï¬‚exibility . yes , definitely . mean even going back virtual bill 2020 , 's lot buzz around azure . wanted spend moment maybe help investor understand sort azure arc ? important ? touch little bit , enable customer kind moving forward ? - julia white q - philip winslow - julia white yes . , 'm glad asked , bit complicated area , right ? people like , talking ? azure , break , two thing , right ? first thing azure arc literally take management , control plane 's policy kind manage virtual machine service extends azure , use manage resource azure , use extend , anywhere . way manage sits premise , system manages . system run aws , example . extends azure management plan . 're setting policy globally , selling resource allocation globally . 's first part . management plan extends , enables second thing call arc enable azure software . managed service run management plan , mean wherever arc presides , take azure service . azure sql database , azure postgresql database , azure kubernetes service , also run wherever want . , comment like , hey , want run edge device location , right ? want run on-premise . want distributed model . want put data service sitting different cloud type ï¬‚exibility enables . 's core make real 's conceptually ( inaudible ) , 're one world 's largest medical equipment supplier , right ? -- 've done use azure arc deploy update consistently scale azure medical equipment , distributed world , right ? pandemic needed quickly update , imaging , diagnostic equipment type thing could remotely . way get manage one place , across system . right . well , got five minute left let 's shift edge . mentioned earlier , big fan edge stuff . n't give u update think intelligent ai , sort life cycle intelligent agent ? think opportunity microsoft azure ? yes . mean , think talked early idea , 's 're becoming bit new normal . thinking like , 's hard think application built today , n't combination cloud edge technology , right ? maybe people n't talk way think way , manufacturing plant , right ? connected system 's -- course , using cloud data analytics . even like big company work gas pump fuel station connected check safety someone smoking they're pumping gas like kind thing edge compute working q - philip winslow - julia whitecloud compute retail shelf notify people stock , cloud edge , contactless delivery system , smart appliance thing example cloud edge application pattern , code sitting edge device , lot code sitting cloud working concert . think way , 's evolves . , networking part 5g emerges get 'll become capable really ultra-low latency requirement well . also another two point unlocking next step function . think maturity - - 's edge device maturity certainly happening , 're help -- trying help industry thing like azure sphere world-class security even mcu device ability run full ai model small device . 're getting high performance . 're getting secure . 're getting cheap . unlocks edge part cloud perspective , right ? investment iot service , ai service thing like azure arc make possible . 'd say -- 're mainstream thing , 's pretty much kind new normal move forward . yes . kind feel like 's becoming real . mean every time 're thinking , year sort unveiled azure ( inaudible ) edge intelligent edge . sort example drone scanning pipeline looking crack 're like -- 're starting see year later . 's sort seeing evolved hear example drone forum africa stage build , actually really happening real life 's pretty incredible . one question - one thing talk potentially sort company almost like three tier model , potentially evolving 've got centralized via cloud azure 've got device decided azure [ ph ] maybe 's like running ( inaudible ) . 've also talked sort like edge internet go back kind network question . could point . think called distributed footprint , obviously , talked hyperscale come azure , also think device . maybe n't enough compute power , centralized cloud image late . something 's kind in-between ? think sort distributive footprint azure relative , let 's say , edge cdn vendor might ? yes . well , 've certainly seen u continue expand global region 60 're slowing . -- multiple reason , one beyond serve , customer locally , sit performance perspective , also data set , data privacy , data governance capability , also become increasingly important . driver 's really catalyst continued global expansion broad region world . 's going important part certainly work q - philip winslow - julia white q - philip winslow - julia whitepartnership operator even today edge zone term working operator around edge zone u , edge zone . continuing expand even region look like certainly continue see well . well , okay got two minute , could n't pas opportunity ask question , -- obviously , 've seen every reason ( inaudible ) market azure ( inaudible ) play xbox exercise microsoft 's strategy call , content king game pas . maybe talk ( inaudible ) play role ? yes . well mean xbox possible azure awesome one microsoft thing gaming perspective , -- vision reach 3 billion gamers planet want make azure platform that's best building game developer , right , like building next fantastic game . xbox kind world-class game streaming experience xbox game past , leveraging azure behind obviously make azure better even thing like xbox game studio , minecraft , halo , gear war built using azure make azure even capable , also help refine think offer game streaming perspective . place first party gaming area actually wonderful kind synergy platform powering underneath . interesting thing , 's super useful gaming , -- high performance low latency application planet , right ? people 's -- gamers tolerance zero . , really push platformer , really push azure , 's also great , want run nasdaq cloud , gosh , , similar type type requirement transferable benefit broader industry versus gaming . right . awesome . well , super informative 30 minute went fast . touched lot thing thankfully u talk pretty fast , able cover lot . julia , thank joining u virtually . like said , super informative , talking . awesome . thank much .
