right . thanks crowd making end day . appreciate chris nvidia coming ir side talk u story . presentation today . 're going go straight q & . extent question , 've said 17 time today , please wait mike coming webcast hear . one way 've starting . 's little specific guy broad-based analog guy , et cetera . 've starting asking question current business condition . generally , 're seeing . compare contrast might help frame , know ca n't really change guidance , last couple year , back half year generally disappointing company , business gotten bit choppy , could talk seasonal perspective . either way , seeing current business condition versus 've seen year past second half ? 're number business . 'll try take segment . look geforce business , consumer graphic business , two different dynamic operate market . desktop side business , 's chieï¬‚y gaming business . seems -- going use word immune . 's probably strong word . right , seems , 's still growing strongly . 's immune pc malaise , going say . continues grow strongly , asp growing . market continuing well . pc gamers still want play game . side business oem business , largely notebook graphic . 's weak , like rest pc notebook market weak . course , 's consumer . 're exposed consumer side . ross seymore chris evendenlook number pc market , surprise . consumer worse commercial . obviously , 're feeling , like anybody else . netting . year year , revenue-wise , 's approximately ï¬‚at . course , profit going gaming business much profitable netbook oem business . moving quadro , workstation business , currently looking pretty strong . 've two consecutive quarter strong growth . 80 % revenue business driven manufacturing . cad biggest application area quadro . manufacturing data look pretty good . pmi data look good . took uptick last month . everyone know car manufacturing data fantastically good recently . reason continued optimism . reason focus market 90 % dollar share market . bunch promising initiative try grow market , dominant term equation , like , market . 's pretty well . business , 're small growth business bigger market . ca n't give extra market insight result , 's really share gain story , like tesla . tesla 's extremely well . talk later . 's small part massive high-performance computing market . 's necessarily relevant perspective . ditto tegra well . tegra relatively small part mobile computing market . well n't start diving main segment , ? gpu side obviously bread butter company . 'll stick consumer side first leave used call professional service business , psb , . gpu side thing , talk little bit strategy . guy done incredibly good job otherwise challenging pc environment making margin rise . revenue side equation relatively strong well . talk little bit 've able deliver . part share gain . 've competitive product . mean , kepler , architecture , current generation gpu architecture , genuinely good architecture . 's better chip . think fixed problem . 're back track . 're 65 % market share , feel like good level . part innate strength gaming market referred earlier . genuinely strong genuinely independent -- apparently independent aï¬ „ ictions affecting rest pc market . notebook market , like said , . ross seymore chris evenden ross seymoreso pc market , pc gaming market , diï¬ƒcult one measure . 's diï¬ƒcult find good data . believe 's growing 10 % annually , based software sale . software sale actually diï¬ƒcult measure , something like 80 % pc gaming revenue go online , online . 20 % packaged software sale . ca n't take best buy gauge health pc gaming market , give misleading picture health gaming market . 80 % online revenue downloads game , online version buying software . increasingly large part subscription game purchase , micro-transactions , sort thing . 's new model generating life software . frankly , chinese software situation forced game developer find new way generating revenue , people n't buying software china . innovation caught . see . mean , frankly , see phone platform well . people used paying $ 0.99 game , getting game free . mean , get grand theft auto shield android gaming device $ 4.99 , full version grand theft auto . 's different model . 's driving lot success pc gaming . 's diï¬ƒcult count . end day , 10 % year seems right number . talk notebook side , ultimate consumer side going market anything specific nvidia , core pc gaming side , close level 've started stabilizing notebook side . core gaming 's left revenue guy ? 's good question . 's hard say . think lot weakness notebook side driven fact tablet better solution consumer pc . 're using pc general computing task , like surfing web , updating facebook , reading writing email , tablet 's much better solution vast majority people . 's much convenient , 's instant , always connected , 's portable . pc , last laptop took 10 minute boot . 's general-purpose pc user migrating tablet . however , like said , gamers , pc specific purpose . 's specialized purpose . like designer workstation specific purpose , researcher tesla workstation specific purpose . 's like destination mind , rather something need . frankly , people email surf web facebook function adult 21st century . think 's one background thing done . chris evenden ross seymore chris evenden ross seymore chris evendenkind scary , n't ? well apparently adult . 've learned child old people facebook . instagram actually way go . tablet already cool anymore . yes . get gaming side equation . 'll stick even desktop side thing , impact think new console refresh whole process ? get console question 're playing much , generation . 's funny . 's little data . went back look data , people company adhere strongly completely opposite point view console refresh affect company . went back looked data . n't really data affect ( inaudible ) . 's diï¬ƒcult tell , pas data affect . downside , obviously , pc gamers typically 1.x console . 're gamers . money buy new console presumably come wallet used buy pc game pc gaming hardware . however , pc gamers spend $ 1,000 $ 5,000 pc . 're fairly well compared typical gamer . might mitigate . 's argument actually , since new console close pc , actually ; 're like entry-level gaming system . 're within band gaming pc , whereas , far , diï¬ƒcult port software across much work . generate asset specifically pc gamers . 's much higher quality gaming experience . 've got sort entry-level pc gaming experience console . argument go developer would developed console game find much easier port game across pc they're likely see greater amount high-quality content pc . would drive pc gaming sale . ross seymore chris evenden ross seymore chris evenden ross seymoreso argue , , way . honestly , n't know 's going turn . console generation going interesting one , market changed . alluded earlier . people spent last seven year learning buy software free $ 0.99 increment . idea spending $ 560 xbox one another $ 60 copy halo even start playing anathema large proportion modern gamers . 'll see . mean , pre-orders , 've read , pre-orders look satisfactory . 'd interested see 's early adopter whether stop whether continue evolve beyond . yes . 's hard figure much complementary much substitution effect , even bull bear company prospect could argue $ 0.99 game n't good thing company sell high-end graphic -- general . talked predominant portfolio . yes , $ 0.99 typically source income game . like one colleague recently bought game , car-racing game . think paid $ 2.99 android marketplace . subsequently spent $ 40 buying car . bought sucker . yes , bought game . 'm still racing prius 's got porsche . wo n't take . point way mean extracting value customer . people pay $ 2.99 game decide rubbish never come back . people pay $ 2.99 game , decide actually quite like . would really like next car . they'll spend $ 5 . 'll say , oh , , really want car . oh . car's part bundle . spend $ 15 , instead getting car want , get car sort would like well . know , $ 40 lighter . 's trouble high-bandwidth connection spent lot money quickly without even feeling . point funding high-end game , even $ 0.99 entry level . chris evenden ross seymore chris evenden ross seymore chris evenden ross seymoreright . yes . 'm arguing funding side . taking opposite side , many people would said -- leave tegra -- device like , play game , like said , shield device , $ 0.99 , play grand theft auto -- oh , see 're saying . would compete pc game . killed pc game . clearly , pc game market actually done quite well . similar analogy , think ( inaudible ) . two different type gamer , right ? $ 0.99 game casual game . , starting get decent high-end game sort entry-level price . 's different sort experience . 's lean-back opposed lean-forward experience . people used talk . pc gamers fiercely loyal pc gaming , mouse-keyboard interface . 'll hear 'll rather die conceding 's best interface ever developed playing game . 're loyal . mentioned earlier , 'll buy gaming platform well , pc gamers gamers . pc favorite platform , probably one invest . , 'll ipads . 'll latest android phone well . 'm sure much cannibalization get . 'll see people . moving back original part topic , get back game console side , guy played role ip side thing , actual silicon , prior generation . time 's gone amd side equation . happen ? focus much ? think 's really good question ask console manufacturer . there's reason console game industry . danger participating console industry cause lose focus core market . lot reason would want participate ; lot reason company would choose u amd . would n't want speculate . chris evenden ross seymore chris evendenwas architectural change looking like pc integrating amd call apu , putting cpu together gpu single die , something guy gpu side . n't x86 . true . n't x86 . . tegra . , 's really question microsoft sony . want specifically x86 ? part story ? switch -- talked gaining share part driver , going back 65 % level kepler involved . view dynamic , going forward ? steady state 're kind limited market grows , think maybe competition focusing game console side , 's share could find ? think , take step back look market , feel pretty stable level . zoom close , obviously , 're fighting tooth nail every single design win . 're fighting aggressively every oem . 're fighting aggressively channel . 're working hard . 'll see , they'll win win , 'll win win . 's awful lot backwards forward . 's equilibrium . 's dynamic equilibrium zoom . think sometimes people try zoom much . try conversation one oem oem . think , conversation , try hard make sure 're mistaking wood tree try stay focused big picture . step back , think 65/35 seems like good level . know , amd worked hard , aggressively software bundling promotion . 's hard imagine n't effect share . certainly n't ever feel 're position ever adjust price , despite fact giving away $ 240 software graphic card , extremely expensive promotion run , even though 're paying $ 60 . 're probably paying significant amount , given cost gpu system . 've got new product coming couple month . feel 've got pretty good bead would counter . course , point , 'll new product . , 's back forth , back forth , fight , fight , fight . end day , probably stable . ross seymore chris evenden ross seymore chris evenden ross seymore chris evendenthere ups down . 20,000-foot view , think 's probably fairly stable share . 20,000-foot view , without asking preannounce anything , course . think response kepler come . subsequent architecture kepler come , roughly speaking ? middle next year , early next year ? well think response come next week , understanding . 'll see put whether 's significant advance current architecture proprietary lineup . wo n't talk product . try . 're going announce announce , yes . right , right . -- bit ancillary discussion . pertinent long ago . shrinking side equation . small die . challenge getting access reasonable price . argument partnership versus customer relationship foundry , et cetera . important chasing moore 's law . fight appears ever-increasing cost chasing moore 's law ? think 's important realize architecture trump process every time . obviously , smaller process node generally better larger process node . architecture much significant impact performance . fact , software put architecture much significant impact performance . point numerous example past art ati ahead process node behind performance . see throughout history company ' competition . said , moving new process node valuable add transistor find new way differentiate add value consumer . long find way make consumer experience noticeably better , moving smaller node good thing . 'll keep . meanwhile , ross seymore chris evenden ross seymore chris evendenwe innovate process node well . improve architecture , come completely new architecture , carry tuning existing architecture make eï¬ƒcient -- either compact , power-eï¬ƒcient , performance -- work dimension . good thing moving fast one process node next mean n't re-spin chip often . would want move node point , point want move new node introduce new step function graphic functionality feature . slowing movement node node could actually good thing u , enables u reduce node transition cost . would imagine guinea pig node longer another benefit well . let ashcrofts guy . would think 'd almost certainly product advanced node available . 's question quickly transition . 's quite pressure . advantage term cost performance stark past , 's pressure move rapidly . make choice product move . last question traditional graphic side thing integration . guy used play chipset side . got pulled cpu apu , amd call . integration graphic capability chipset actual cpu always big concern . yet , last couple year , guy grown rather nicely , whether market share gain pricing what-not . see dynamic , threat integration low end , impacting business ? interesting thing . going back way described geforce market gaming pc market , equates approximately desktop . oem market , equates approximately notebook , 's quite perfect correlation , oem desktop gaming notebook . first order approximation , 's pretty good . , gamers , buy gaming pc 're playing game . something ; 's part . 's part self-actualization . oems buy graphic , graphic performance . want discrete graphic differentiate laptop . exactly . oem survive selling entry-level laptop . want sell $ 500 laptop , $ 600 laptop . . justify increase cost ? part intel brand , i3 , i5 , i7 . part integrated discrete . consumer buying laptop , general-purpose consumer talked , looking utilitarian notebook . 're buying -- 're using price proxy quality . 're getting graphic , accident . 's strong term . almost incidentally , part buying better-quality pc . get real benefit , course . 're buying graphic performance . guy looking 3dmark vantage score $ 600 notebook . 's like walk liquor store buy bottle wine . people , course , benchmarking guide , parker . benchmarking guide wine . many people know walk shelf , going , `` well 's $ 40 bottle wine score 80 parker 's . one 's $ 45 bottle wine score 92 parker 's . term point per dollar , 's much better bottle wine . think 'll buy one . '' people like . analogous pc gamers . pc gamers buy benchmark , absolutely . u buy wine based price proxy quality . 'm drinking alone , might buy $ 15 bottle wine . 'm trying impress girlfriend 's parent , meeting first time , might buy $ 40 bottle wine . gave metaphor jensen , way . laughed , think 'd cook $ 40 bottle wine . 's important point well , reason spend certain amount pc important technology much money ? u might buy $ 700 laptop love technology . others u might realize actually $ 400 going meet need well . 's fine , like people buy expensive car cheap car . toyota camry -- basic function car , toyota camry good bmw car . still u like idea owning bmw , even twice price . long , rambling story end day , say people buying laptop buying performance . intel getting better graphic performance displace discrete graphic . thing could displace discrete graphic , like bomb cost pressure touch screen perhaps one thing might displace discrete graphic . graphic performance one thing . 've debate 10 year . remember first started graphic industry , well 10 year ago , debate journalist way back intel launching , think , 945g chipset . much better graphic . different time . ross seymore chris evendenfor entry-level discrete graphic . 's recurring debate . reason never happens 're buying graphic performance . right . well let 's switch gear tegra side , smaller part business . probably larger frequency question get . recent quarter , 's july quarter end guy , tough quarter . know reason . 've guided significantly next quarter . thing ramping nicely . 're still two quarter , 50 % 70 % , roughly , year year . talk little bit transition away tegra 3 tegra 4. guess biggest-picture question really come win game even pseudo-incumbents , merchant perspective , n't seem getting best margin coming side ? 's bunch question . let 's post-mortem win ? post-mortem year tegra 4 late . , obviously , meant disadvantaged competing big tablet , important tablet , competing tegra 3. , reason lateness , sometimes product late . deliberate sense decided wanted double tegra 4 tegra 5. made sure going miss deadline amazon google tegra 4 , least tegra 5 would schedule . least tegra 4i , bring accelerate market , tegra 4i integrated product , mainstream smartphone product . 've seen 've sampling tegra 4i since february . we've started sampling project logan , presumably become tegra 5 fullness time . actually demo 'd early july . 've sampling since august . 're good schedule . 're right place compete amazon google tablet . company's , focused bringing tegra 4i market bringing tegra 5 revenue quickly possible . know , software team 's focused , hardware team 's focused , sale team 's focused . yes , mean certainly first half year diï¬ƒcult revenue standpoint . diï¬ƒcult choice . right thing , put u right place future year . mean , could doubled tegra 4 probably still late win thing . perhaps tegra 5 would pushed late win next year . 're really trouble . 're behind playing catch-up forever . way , actually really good product available right time compete win . ross seymore chris evenden ross seymore guess second part question , let 's assume tegra 5 hit market time google amazon refresh , et cetera . market standalone apps processor big enough warrant investment ? oh , yes , yes . look android , android ubiquitous . android everywhere . 're going see everywhere , manner device , phone tablet . 're going see car , 're going see tv , 're going see set-top box , probably whole bunch category n't thought yet . many application , visual computing important . , heart , visual computing company . value bring customers' product . differentiation consumer see . wherever android intersects visual computing , 's tegra succeed . that's phone , 's tablet , 's device mentioned . 's large market -- large , fact , succeed phone , tegra still success . emphasize 're wholly committed succeeding phone . 've got great chip tegra 4i . succeed ? well look -- talked state merchant 's market application process . said 's attractive market . pc market n't look like attractive market , either , yet pc business , pc gaming business , extremely attractive -- 10 % year growth , mid-50s gross margin , highly profitable , highly defensible well . put lot software around , actually , term driver also lot work 've done ecosystem . hundred engineer function work developer get latest feature -- feature -- game . defensible market . , let 's see replicate mobile computing market well , win specific segment , segment unique skill experience . one would likely defensible grow long term well . going head-to-head competitor across whole phone tablet market would seem suicide , right ? find defensible segment unique advantage . intersection visual computing android specifically make gaming matter . think 's good place u . point , 's certainly big enough profitably fund development tegra . 've going long way . let 's open question audience . unidentified participant chris evenden unidentified participant chris evendenhi . one thing 'm curious diï¬ƒculties market general integrating communication , lte particular , processor mobile space . 's something 've managed . certainly qualcomm done . seems something lot harder think lot people feeling would . want understand , really , hard whether give sustainable advantage , given 's really one competitor . think pretty good position right . 3g voice data modem 's shipping couple year . 4g data modem that's shipping year . 4g voice data modem 's currently well way qualification . 4g data modem 's likely qualification next month . think 're probably pretty good position . 's lot claim counterclaim company . diï¬ƒcult know exactly everyone . feel like 're right front pack , least . think , five year , none matter . 4g important part buying decision wifi manufacturer today , connectivity . 's important today 's one company . 's focusing everyone 's mind . think advantage u . fact , even importantly advantage u , cease headwind . think , operate high end market , solely high end mobile computing market . operate market without access lte modem tough proposition , lte becomes essential high-end phone . fact 've success , think , good progress u . ( inaudible-audience question ) . question , talk integration chip ? n't know want go great detail technical challenge . think issue much integration . lte , 's complex lot people would happen believe . saw recently . broadcom bought beceem . beceem 's wimax company . wimax lot feature common lte . 's lte . 's bigger step wimax lte think anticipating , hence last week 's acquisition renesas . ross seymore chris evendenbut integration , n't think particular hurdle . think 's actually building lte modem . 's computationally intensive task . 's complex term , particularly , handling voice call handheld . 's lot work need done . look integration , took u , u acquiring icera actually sampling chip integrated lte modem 20 month . feel pretty good . think 's testament skill engineer involved . like said , think big -- 's obviously technical challenge integrating product like . think big technical challenge lte modem . question audience ? 2 minute left . little bit different question . strategic question nature . shield getting hardware side bit chatter earlier week potentially tablet , nvidia-branded tablet , talk little bit thought process behind getting hardware one side , confirmed . maybe even one way . rumor , never comment rumor . 'll try quick since 've rambling far . shield side , 's couple thing shield . want sell lot . want make money selling . also , way shield succeeds u helping u build fortress gaming inside mobile computing space , 's bridge , like , strength pc gaming soon-to-be strength , hope , mobile gaming . 's great device . , build ? generally , 'm pretty conservative company 's capability . genuinely think 's company know much gaming hardware software . 've got experience mobile , pc , console market . hundred people spend entire life working directly game developer . 've got 20 year -- 20 year experience market . huge brand gamers . 70 million geforce user today know . brand awareness , brand preference , particularly country like china , huge . 90 % market share i-cafes china , example . there's big , big brand equity leverage launch product . succeed , n't think anyone 's likely make product succeed . 's niche product . 're going sell ten million unit year . n't think 's going offend existing customer base . see specific niche . understand , 've communicated ross seymore chris evenden operatorcarefully launch explain work . yes , think 're right people build product . great . -- ask question afterwards , time end day . thank making end day . chris , thank bringing u home strong fashion . thank . question answer question .
