'll take order . look broadly throughput . 'll start peak . want talk little bit 've done throughout dayparts recently . 'll remember , year ago , struggled throughput peak , particularly high-volume mop store . , created specific role trained role , peak , support mop . , maybe 7 8 partner working peak , 3 4 might portion mop , fulfilling order , consolidating order , handoff . 1,500 store -- trained either 1 2 role , store , trained run role consolidation . , partner would share calling handoff . really high-volume store , train someone consolidate order cold case oven espresso machine together get ticket ready go one partner call . could make -- 's 4 hour day , right ?

's call . really , 's based upon 's happening store , many people deployed . 's five year since 've done . way , absolutely weighted many transaction , course . transaction , complex transaction , labor earn . n't really weighted specifically product mix transaction , deeply product mix store-by-store . even transaction , sort lot average store type opposed store- specific . every store every daypart many people staffed , . . 'll rattle couple stats . go back five year ago , cold beverage % total beverage revenue starbucks store mid-30 % , think 's 36 % , 37 % . roll forward five year , cold beverage 50 % beverage sale . many store , they've doubled , right ? 've gone 30 60 something like . warmed breakfast sandwich doubled many store , yet play based upon average number transaction deployment based upon average five year ago . store , high mix cold . 'll 2 partner standing back back , one espresso machine one cold beverage station working concurrently . previously , might someone espresso machine turning around trying keep cold beverage . throughput suffers . impact inﬂuences everything . 's 3 week . partner response really strong . 'm copied lot . think 're something . think 're good start . even partner happy nothing else happens , 's going good thing . think also part help afternoon . could pivot . afternoon . give guy little bit math , 're comping positively morning daypart last quarter . lunch ﬂattish afternoon ... traﬃc ? traﬃc . yes . yes . total comp , given comp reported 2 % . lunch ﬂattish . afternoon quite negative . think afternoon evening daypart , 's pretty small daypart . think size negative comp 're seeing . 're seeing afternoon , holiday . 're seeing afternoon opportunity make sure partner focused customer first . 's 've taken eye completely customer . many thing going afternoon daypart . , sort driven u around q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan maw q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan mawjust cleaning training restocking . want make sure -- 're , 're keeping eye customer . think new deployment , help free . , afternoon , 's big opportunity , think , around product . move particularly warmer month , nitro big part . cold brew broadly . nitro . 've got lot thing planned around iced tea done well u . think afternoon daypart , right product . challenge , know , frappuccino declining faster new product growing . 's new product n't working . 's net given frappuccino decline slightly negative . , digital becomes big opportunity u , lighting new 1 million member coming . also , watch offer carefully lot sprint 're . star dash gamification pointed afternoon . come , afternoon bring friend come , afternoon next two day get 100 star . thing pointed afternoon . think start turn pretty negative daypart , -- probably positive year . even get slightly negative , 'll help comp ton . let 's discus frappuccino . mean , talked percentage sale , example , summer month ? excuse n't remember . yes . think 've talked , full year , 's somewhere mid-teens sale mix . 's meaningful category u . right . -- presumably , summer . stopping frappuccino happy hour , mean , belief , mean , longer discount someone going buy frappuccino anyway , discount actually driving increased traﬃc . allowing people spend le would buy . n't risk business ? guess , like much -- much anxiety kind pulling promotion obviously used put decent amount faith ? right . 's happened frappuccino -- got exactly right . what's happened frappuccino last two year happy hour halo get promotion gone away . used happen , frappuccino happy hour . 'd sell ton frappuccino , 'd comp well time period . would happen , people would continue come buy frappuccinos beverage afternoon higher rate throughout third quarter . really paid back . n't actually pay q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan mawback promo . wonderful . -- impact top mind people . softness 've seen last two year . financially , bottom line standpoint , really n't worth last two year would n't worth year . question top line , right ? 're trying year sort reinvent happy hour . 'll detail come . basically , gist using digital asset light frappuccino happy hour people think 's truly incremental . basically count fact halo 's probably going come try get real incrementality 're running happy hour . 've got another -- number product promotion time frame . think close gap . , thing , 'd remind , frappuccino happy hour early quarter positive , back half third quarter last year pretty tough . think comparison full quarter , get -- feel comfortable least 3 % get back half year . 's thing . fact , yes , little bit bigger comparison . big p & l driver . 've got number thing around cold beverage , probably specific frappuccino happy hour offer offset happy hour . , think good momentum move rest quarter comp strongly . thought get 3 % year . -- let take . least 3 % comp back half year , december 1 % . mean , think 've commented january 1 % . couple different thing . mean , let 's isolate january think impact starbucks card gift . let 's isolate lobby like experience might lapped . mean , 's possible isolate maybe throughput initiative , mean , deployment 2.0 n't put yet . word , january anomaly ? , secondly , 'll come back understand holiday . mean , holiday something 's always going low quarter 's something need accept expect ? holiday '18 -- 'm sorry , pressing u fiscal '19 , reason believe take december quarter back trend ? yes , let 's break little think 's fair question 's people's mind . think -- first quarter , holiday quarter , first 6 week , half quarter , strong momentum really continuation 3 % comp 've done . place went holiday . pretty much right went holiday , saw impact 're talking . back half quarter , math . 1 comp . said january similar without completely backing corner . obviously , 're ballpark . january soft well looked quite bit like back half holiday period . actually driver . q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan maw q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan maw q - john william ivankoeso saw january , 2 thing particular , continuation softness lobby . , think ongoing holiday typically get little bit carryforward january move final merch . , second thing , n't get gift card tailwind . gift card negative year-over-year . ﬂat . typically get nice tailwind comp get january . tailwind actually little bit headwind . small amount . meaningful . get january , 2 thing almost , definition , abate . 's still gift card coming . 's 0. 's huge number . thing -- talked , change deployment , product thing like blonde espresso , great start . thing 're digital , think 's enough move u back get towards 3 % run rate move rest year . 's give u confidence get 3 % year . think january -- sorry , john , maybe -- think driver january different saw holiday related holiday , think would harder sort understand 's going happen . 's little bit 's move forward . 's also thing momentum around . talk holiday ... 2018 , sorry . yes . first quarter '19 ... think , first , lobby entirely different . even wo n't negative comp impact , 'm sure positive , still year-over-year decrease number skus . promise , profitable . fewer mark-outs , fewer bogos , fewer write-off . thing hurt u lobby . top line standpoint , guess 's opportunity , maybe , go little bit better lobby . bottom line standpoint , 'll absolutely better . get holiday beverage , think 've learned last year 2 're going really go deep around digital holiday . channel , email app . also social medium channel really try make sure 're everything reach customer digitally . 's driving comp . feel like kind offset headwind 've seen . okay . annoying question , unicorn frappuccino big driver last year ? mean begun kind talk prepare u ? - scott harlan maw q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan maw q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan maw q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan mawan encore ? yes . -- mean , pretty big driver month april . 've got number thing teed , ca n't quite announce yet . think watch kevin talk annual shareholder ' meeting . obviously , earnings , 'll give update . look , think offset comp , course month april . course quarter . 'll see . 's relatively big number . n't think 're terribly nervous , particularly take little bit longer-term view . wonderful product . 've got thing planned , think , pretty cool well . never even laid eye one . n't either . mean , meeting john culver . n't laid eye one . said . sudden , mobile ordered paid one . someone brought store . 'm like , oh , 's . 's actually pretty good . 's lot . yes . well already gone time -- go every day . n't even know happens . okay . ... got number thing planned , think , offset . deployment 2.0. mean , 've focusing throughput side . cost side ? let 's take cost . , kind push part equation . obviously , u.s. margin wanted fiscal '17 . n't wanted first quarter '18 . begin least stabilize ? take grow america 's margin ? yes . go time tax investment came . go back guidance , basically . guided . said first half going challenged . back half , start see improved margin , margin expansion . adjust tax impact , 're still ballpark u.s. think get third quarter , fourth quarter , see little bit margin expansion . 's going anything like saw 2014 q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan maw2015 . little bit margin expansion , given investment , think , fine . 's driving think question . normal work around , 's easy . something 've around cost good sold . 's looking good . think couple hundred million target year . 're track get vast majority . year , launched 2 new initiative . roz really leading driving thing . background wonderful partner . labor saving waste saving . , 're sort three month . first quarter , running track . significant saving . know . big opportunity taking look store de- averaging . looking store surface , analyze seattle . surface , look like little waste -- little labor . want want add product . want add labor drive sale . ﬂip , call green tail . red tail distribution , 's much , right ? want manage cost . 're really good start . 's lean principle 're deploying . 's lot analytics we're getting store-by-store , working district manager , working store manager . opportunity significant . build obviously , back-end loaded , right , get pipeline built . feel like execute , get back margin growth , excluding tax investment . 're thinking , including tax investment ? 'll lap majority get third quarter next year . wage increase announced go place april . okay . lot company last -- yesterday , suppose , talked putting technology reduce labor hour , eﬃciency , effectiveness really driven nice , need , especially high-wage market home state number market business . extent technology -- enter tipping point technology consumer use brand potentially new thing ( inaudible ) , begin -- 'll start reduce number eﬃciency effectiveness term store-level labor expense ? yes , think one thing 've done around , example , supply chain . impact store manager obviously ordering stocking inventory . 're continuing look automation opportunity , manufacturing distribution center , robotics distribution center improve eﬃciency accuracy order . get manager le le involved store order . automated ordering something 're looking . literally , still chance look q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan maworder . 're filling order every day . come . 's highly accurate automation supply chain . 're well . within store , 're looking time , although lean technique , we're getting far smarter time motion around espresso machine get espresso machine positioned right store ? many need ? 're starting work upstream . matter fact , got new espresso machine test right couple store . 're working upstream manufacturer make quicker way deliver espresso . also enable -- bluetooth ; wi-fi-enabled constantly looking eﬃciency machine , grind look like taking work partner . 're adjusting grind 3 4 time day , happening automatically . helping within store . , talk deployment work , , 's really using analytics figure use people without folk . know , people transaction , earn labor . deployment 2.0 , probably 95 % plus store , 's simply redeployment better analytics . help store experience . goal -- way think , john , goal non value-added activity n't touch customer touch product . want simplify greatly . wo n't automating make espresso beverage . know 're saying . wo n't automating make breakfast sandwich . 've looked automating thing , like , could automate brewing ? anything really starbucks experience , always handcrafted . may free thing premium side . mean , thing like drip , example , 's automated would fine , especially there's handcrafted element term reserve bar within starbucks store . 's something couple year ago , thought going relatively big conversion opportunity within traditional starbucks u.s. store base term putting reserve bar . n't sound like that's big opportunity least short term . ability put customer-facing attribute within starbucks store , hey drive like additional traﬃc drive additional ticket term -- capital perspective ? yes -- answer yes . think intuition number new starbucks reserve bar , let 's call , versus converted , get 20 % store starbucks reserve bar , 'll meaningful number conversion . betting , would say would majority go renovation look opportunity even one 're testing u.s. , 're conversion . think intuition right . talk store return . talked fair bit yesterday , new store drive-throughs . . 've got 80 % drive-throughs , 20 % urban market . 20 % store , skew q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan mawway 're talking . new store reserve bar . many reserve forward . 're third place experiential retail , thing 've decade . store still really good return . 're high drive-through . u , 's absolutely critical . back away premium experience write expression brand . 'll continue invest store , get great return , maybe little bit lower see drive-throughs , drive convenience transaction drive-through store . last thing 'll say , really want see , little bit scale couple dozen reserve bar u.s. , go china , lot . whether 're reserve bar tag put , reserve forward store , pour , slow bar , clover , thing -- way enjoy coffee premium end . thank . mercato food solution ? mean , currently stand , mean , packaging 's -- austere might sound like negative word . minimal , 's fairly high priced . obviously , 's much harder manage inventory coming , coming store every single day . mean , permanent solution see 's right country ? going still going done market-specific basis ? yes , think 're still sorting . 're 2 market . 'll roll 6 market end year . 've said mercato roll , 's probably 30 40 skus . know exact number . let 's say 's 30 skus . 's couple dozen skus , right , okay , come mercato banner . skus really , really well . skus good . trying learn skus go every store across u.s. ? probably , right , supply chain eﬃciency standpoint . skus go every store u.s. ? perhaps . champion skus . skus go store along coast ? maybe . 's figure . figured cost good sold . figured delivery cost . 're still working 's demand equation , 's value equation 's waste solution . believe number fresh -- fresher skus store come mercato . question scale . think 's nature question . want go beyond food . food growth next year predicated mercato . little -- 've gotten question little bit folk . think 's upside u afternoon . 's upside u around fresh . look today , sou vide egg bite , new innovation , 're driving ton growth . 've got level bistro box everything protein forward . 've got upleveling 've done breakfast sandwich . driving 2 point comp . food comp innovation quite healthy . 1 point beverage comp , 'd different discussion . q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan maw q - john william ivankoe cannibalization , obviously , u.s. , especially given rate store growth relatively -- depending quarter , relatively ﬂattish same-store traﬃc , mean , measuring ? seen -- n't think seeing national basis . n't know 're seeing local basis . mean , seen cannibalization local basis , materially taken capital one market . said listen , higher return -- cannibalization real time data , example , robust ? yes , 'll use word sale transfer . look sale transfer , track -- there's sensitivity around word . track store-by-store . 're absolutely right , john . see sale transfer open store . plan , actually . couple slide yesterday . used store fort collins , colorado , really profitable store shopping center fort collins , think , $ 1.5 million , remember correctly , 700 auvs . opened drive-through , big , beautiful drive-through , couple hundred -- 'm sorry , couple mile away . $ 2.5 million something like sale . 's 1,000 transaction . happened existing store within first year . planned , lost 100 auvs , right ? , happens come back comp base comp . math around new store there's going cannibalization . add cannibalization track impacted store , negative number weighted basis . take positive lift get comp year 2 5 open store , 's comp base . take positive negative weighted basis . put together . 's basically 0. sometimes 's little bit positive . sometimes 's little bit negative . basically 0 % impact comp . 're left . picture showed , 're left incremental cash ﬂow 's come new store . 's hugely -- like huge percentage . ca n't give actual percentage . 's vast majority incremental comp . irr , given auvs given relatively lower cost investment . given margin product , 's big incremental benefit cash ﬂow standpoint . last thing 'd say , 'd remind everyone licensed store opened , 're half 750 store opened u.s. , different characteristic company-owned store . tend captive location . 's 's 0 cannibalization . way , track . model cannibalization licensed store well . 's different type impact . said word said 'd never use . model sale transfer license store well , 's different type impact . last question . -- 80 % store drive-through . n't talk significant drive-through throughput . mean , kind ultimate single - scott harlan maw q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan maw q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan maw q - john william ivankoe - scott harlan mawqueue , faster , people 're going serve . right . want talk -- place lean helping u today . time motion study . thing go look highest throughput drive-through store drive- , much telemetry 's ordering everything close , right ? unlike po n't yet dom rolled everywhere , 're closing every order . drive-through , close every order . know exactly long every product take make . find best drive-throughs , , using distribution . find best drive-throughs . time motion study . 're starting train drive-throughs . mobile order & pay better integrated drive-throughs . mean , 's -- mean , term customer come queue , product made right time . mean , 's always challenge . ...
