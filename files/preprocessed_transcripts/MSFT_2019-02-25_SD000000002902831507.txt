thank , everyone , joining u today introduction . thank dave o'hara microsoft joining u . get good stuff , please note important disclosure , including personal holding disclosure morgan stanley disclosure , morgan stanley public website www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures registration desk . microsoft , safe harbor begin . microsoft may make forward-looking statement presentation . sure refer sec filing risk factor relating business . 's true whether 're person listening web . right , 's way . dave , thank joining u . maybe benefit everyone room , give u little bit introduction sort , role microsoft , purview little bit sort history tenure microsoft ? sure , thanks . cfo commercial business microsoft . commercial business , people familiar . role working field term field finance expand field footprint well scott guthrie c & ai side harry shum ai side . question answer - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith weissgot . maybe like get product division , one thing dave talked fundamental behind research . lot primary work , lot survey work . one thing got excited microsoft part $ 1 trillion cio survey past couple year , really starting three year ago , saw real turn way cio seeing microsoft . went legacy tech something people increasingly looking invest 're looking increase wallet share microsoft budget . think happened past 3 four year 's really changed perception among cio microsoft vendor want push dollar ? well one think understand big focus enterprise thing enterprise looking . provide great security . 're trusted provider . think breadth software 're interested . look microsoft one-stop shop . one thing hear lot customer , `` n't want one-off solution . want person go . '' think microsoft represents closest 're going get . see . think really started seeing pickup cloud came hybrid strategy thought -- customer big microsoft footprint plus also want move cloud . want time frame want way work . best help ? that's came hybrid strategy on-prem , cloud , mix timeline . think really resonated lot customer . got . hybrid strategy pretty differentiated big cloud vendor , like amazon google cloud ... yes , think 's something microsoft uniquely others ca n't make offer . company partnering together trying come sort mocked-up hybrid strategy . feel like literally lot on-prem footprint lot cloud footprint . help make smoother transition . uniquely microsoft value proposition . got . dive hybrid side equation , want start azure . azure probably part portfolio get question . fundamental question people trying understand durability growth azure . long could really impressive growth rate continue ? 're beginning use really big scale term big business . talk u think growth trajectory azure ? - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'harasome key customer driver point ? 's driving customer demand platform ? sure . start meta level , every decision make generally start think total adjustable market ? every year , total addressable market cloud get bigger . remember first started , -- certain number . year , keep growing number . perspective , total addressable cloud market going continue grow foreseeable future . look opportunity say every year , get little bigger . every year , seem able expand footprint . feel good -- lot runway cloud starter . one -- message really resonating , first , heard lot customer say , `` go cloud ? go cloud ? '' 're well past . every customer need cloud strategy . they're saying , `` think cloud ? workload move ? '' 're basic thing like storage compute trying get aligned think cloud . 're much deeper . see much interested thing like security . em offering , see interested . think ai ? think iot ? 're much advanced . think , 's safe say really selling encouraging folk move cloud . way , 're pulling u . lot innovative idea . even see lot disruption industry , think newer company coming disrupting old player older player . see coming u saying , `` help develop cloud strategy . help get modern current . '' think 's sort -- n't know go far say limitless . lot runway . one thing cloud , 're selling offering sold per seat , effectively limit number people world . 's sort , lack better word , cap sort per seat offering . cloud offering , 's literally cap . take workload want move cloud . think 's really hard anybody say big going get , 'm confident 's going get bigger . got . dig little bit term workload running azure right ? kind visibility could give u ? net new workload people building natively onto azure ? people moving on-premise workload public cloud environment azure environment ? kind visibility could give u people azure environment ? yes . would divide couple huge category . one migration , migration existing workload cloud . see lot people , storage , compute even heavier biz apps moving cloud . lot stuff 're on-prem , run eﬃciently cloud get scale . see lot q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'haramigration work going . also see lot innovation work migration innovation . database big thing . cosmos db offering , sql database offering , pretty popular . 's . lot time , people want migrate , get going start innovating . increasingly , 're seeing folk saying , `` wait minute , 'm going move stuff cloud , 's great opportunity optimize . let 's optimize migrate time . '' innovate . 's . 2 major category see . got . customer going migrate existing workload public cloud environment , 're using compute , 're using storage , still see up-sell additional higher-value solution around ? workload tend cap compute storage ? definitely see lot up-sell . one thing 're finding , even sale environment transform field , need able create 3-year arc , story say , `` 's ought think moving cloud company . '' really want know , `` give sense end game . '' 's moving workload trying save money . 's like , `` really trying accomplish ? really trying get ? '' work , `` different way could transform business 's could work cloud 's could connected 's would get better data 's could use data serve customer better . '' need holistic story need know 're going . think get better sense 're going , 's easier say , `` okay , get . roadmap start moving stuff . '' end state mind . u , 's really important able tell story paint vision end state could . said , think 's sort interesting -- , lot u educating selling . oftentimes , customer pulling u forward saying , `` hi . ? try ? '' 're much innovative , think . look like lot guy side fence , 're thinking sort transition public cloud . maybe oversimplifying , look lot sort percentage workload run different environment . percentage people running on-premise environment ? percentage people running sort public cloud environment ? judge growth kind net new workload growth plus migration public cloud . sound like 's like third vector 've got thinking workload get , 's additional monetization workload public cloud sort -- migrated . 's functionality vector thinking . q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith weissyes , think even -- 're going pick category , iot , example , think iot still undefined think edge think device could benefit connected cloud almost literally limitless . mean , device room connected cloud already . even device , walk retail outlet , think potential cloud opportunity whereas , device . , addition compute , get data analysis think better serving customer . 's really hard put finger big 's going get think untapped opportunity people n't even thought yet . think additional monetization opportunity n't identified n't monetized yet . right . talked little bit higher-value service , like cosmos db data side . talked security . sort ai , machine learning functionality ? actually utilized big way today ? sort woven sort new application development older application ? really early get real mainstream adoption ? yes . think something like ai , perspective , 's different way could monetize . one build ai existing apps make better . people feeling like 're getting new additional value apps 're already consuming paying . think piece . 'll see lot integration product today . two lot company want understand like , `` possible , ? '' either mc partner organization , basically get consultant contract , 're helping drive innovation build business . think 's big service component n't tech , 's also thinking around tech evolve business . think partner u , 's big service component . 's going help drive revenue . 's folk want consume stuff sort per byte basis . service available , pay go consume want . monetization strategy well . think 's . add expanding tam . got . think biggest investor concern come sort azure public cloud general risk commoditization , big vendor putting lot capital work . going able differentiate solution time ? going differentiation microsoft brings market infrastructure service platform service sustain price ? going race bottom term cheap compute , cheap storage run cloud-based environment ? think differentiation infrastructure service platform service maintaining price point microsoft longer term ? - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'harayes , think u company , 's obligation keep delivering value top core storage compute . think 're good job . think ai one example . iot another example . even em security , continue expand security offering . top cloud dynamic . people always asking think dynamic strategy . oﬃce great saas offering . -- would agree ought storage compute business . adding value top . paas typically better margin iaa saas stuff much better margin really sticky . think 's incumbent u make sure 're driving value-added service top . think long 're , people pay u . got . one last one azure . term sort gross margin profile , overall , cloud gross margin trending really nicely past couple year . recent quarter ahead expectation . amy two year ago . talked sort azure gross margin scaling line 've seen like aws similar scale . still hold true ? still think could sort align sort 've seen aws time ? yes , think still hold true 've already said 'll -- believe could gross margin profile aws point time . reality business getting really big . think reach point sort hit ( chronicle ) gross margin number . n't think we're yet . still think room improvement . think eventually , get point say , `` gross margin going start least moderate . gross margin growth going start moderate . '' still feel like good runway . got . shifting back hybrid discussion , well think sort hybrid positioning help guy differentiate aws google ? seeing differentiation actually win guy deal today ? certainly see differentiation see hybrid message landing . think u , primary benefit customer -- 's 2 primary benefit customer . one 's cheaper way n't pay stuff twice . hybrid offering 're paying on-prem want move cloud , move window server license cloud they're covered . 's certainly cheaper option . two think timeline perspective , give lot ﬂexibility . one thing company said u along , `` hi . made big investment current infrastructure n't want throw move . think q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith weissabout ? '' think able allow continue run current infrastructure get cloud , able expand cloud really like . 's time frame , time frame . 's good news . got . think ﬂexibility expressed -- least satya amy talked u lot term azure hybrid use benefit , contracting methodology customer . talk u exactly , sort give ﬂexibility customer ? sort financial impact thinking investor looking result sort rise hybrid use benefit show income statement ? sure . basically , hybrid use benefit say licensed window server sql server 're current contract , run license cloud . 're going run license aws , example , 're going -- aws , 're going pay u additional license run aws environment . said , `` look , 've already paid microsoft , could run azure additional cost . '' 's 's cheaper . show income statement largely on-prem revenue . question keep getting asked lot think window server growth window server on-prem growth ? think 's perception , going start decreasing materially . obviously seen decent growth on-prem number . part hybrid offering , way structured , show on-prem revenue , fact , 's tied cloud offering . try stay pretty pure term account . stay on-prem side part . customer eventually shift sql server license cloud , still stay on-prem ? shift revenue ? right , way 're accounting on-prem revenue . think 's would continue account . 'm looking ir person make sure n't script answer . yes , would on-prem revenue . got . mentioned concern people around server & tool . part come sort expectation sort on-premise server shipment going slowing , go negative . window server tied server shipment , right ? concerned sort declining server shipment on-premise environment negatively impacting broader server & tool business microsoft ? - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'harawell server & tool business healthy people seen number . reported good , solid q2 feel good outlook intelligent cloud business . 're -- still feel like demand . 're still confident customer going continue purchase product . way look , going back gross margin question second , 's obviously former world , gross margin high simply shipping cd cost lower building data center , example . also feel like 's much offset expanding cloud opportunity . way look , yes , gross margin percentage important . really also think least equally important gross margin dollar driven business . continue expand cloud , gross margin opportunity absolute dollar perspective much material . feel like gross margin shift settle 'll end good dollar gross margin growth well continue drive percentage gross margin cloud . got . really asking question little bit different way , like driver ? like mentioned hybrid cloud . hybrid use advantage , guy started talking lot last year . business growing mid-single digit quite time . 's core driver on-premise server & tool business ? yes . well think core driver on-prem continued build-out data center people think using window server data center . one thing said along continuing geographic footprint build-out data center . others well . window server pretty popular product . people license data center , know 's going continue drive growth business . question get long continue ? n't see cloud 's role getting smaller anytime soon . think eﬃciencies gained . generally think growth continue . got . talk little bit azure stack sort 's problem customer azure stack looking solve particular ? kind traction guy seen azure stack ? think really first rolled last year . kind traction seen solution thus far ? yes , azure stack really intended customer , one , maybe want little bit control want azure stack environment , control . access cloud . 's sort intermittent . one -- example -- example folk q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'harado n't always connected . example , take cruise ship maybe connected connected , still need able run environment , whether 're connected cloud . 're trying give people comfort control environment they'll able continue run environment , whether 're connected . industry , mean lot . need able feature . 's early day azure stack . 've good customer demand . anything , one thing -- one thing customer like choice . n't feel like 're forced one decision another . azure stack choice make . lot time , 'll look say , `` know , 'm comfortable going cloud anyhow . let 's see . '' like fact option want . got . something think term impacting financials see yet ? still early day ? think 's early really see material impact . look part broader cloud offering . plus important thing able give customer choice across range option cloud . azure stack one choice . got . term looking sort financials , end support sql server 2008 window server 2008. end support significant impact -- expect another significant impact financials ? would n't say 's significant impact . think u , key make smooth transition customer . 're working customer . n't expect see material financial growth . want make sure transition , , 's good experience continue path . think 's taking care existing customer . okay . sound like -- guy talk percentage commercial revenue coming recurring source . bounce around like 85 % 90 % . since much recurring . much tied over-time contract individual product life cycle n't going much impact financials . ... yes , think 's right . mean , recurring number , last one pretty close 90 % , plus minus . 's continuing migrate customer move q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith weissthrough cloud transition . think 's recurring revenue net new . got . want talk competitive environment hybrid . touched little bit . seems like 's lot motion past year think people starting realize hybrid architecture going mainstay large enterprise . 've seen response sort microsoft 's strong positioning . aws came outpost offering . anything 're seeing marketplace today ? early see outpost ? well see sale environment . would say 's early day well . think benefit u hybrid offer big share big presence on-prem already . come new offering , lot time , 're cloud version old offering . transition much smoother , 's something anybody need ramp get going . u , existing footprint well new footprint , many case , near super helpful 's easier experience customer . come add new stuff 's growth opportunity u . think cloud vendor existing footprint . 're trying come offering , way , mimic mirror . feel like -- customer already 're using stuff already make better experience . guess , one could argue aws relationship vmware trying . 've got vmware on-premise environment already , something 're comfortable . could run vmware public cloud environment aws . kind familiar interface , familiar solution portfolio running public cloud environment . credible threat hybrid cloud storage microsoft ? well think aws -- obviously formidable competitor . lot respect aws . 's exactly 's intended . think still 2 company , 're 1. okay . 2 company looking become 1 , ibm plus red hat . similar -- least term sort 're positioning acquisition investor , ibm bought red hat , think 's going sort improve hybrid cloud strategy . guy compete red hat lot operating system side equation , 's lot different area compete ibm , think - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith weissthat 's really going change competitive dynamic , seeing 2 vendor get together ? well -- year ago , really started developing much better relationship red hat . right , half vms linux . feel like open source presence . lot customer want mixed environment . n't -- want open source existing vendor mix . want continue relationship red hat . think 's beneficial . think 're confident continue make work customer . think 's interest , think 's red hat ibm 's interest continue work closely together . see continuing . got . want switch back broader cloud gross margin . one way think sort cloud gross margin kind 's two-step function model view much capex investment sort expanding footprint , expanding global footprint cloud ( investing ) . much spent filling data center ? within , 's utilization function effectively utilizing capex within data center ? fair kind framework think cloud gross margin story ? yes , think 's fair framework . , point time , couple year ago , getting lot question cloud gross margin , said , `` hi . playing catch-up . got started game little late . expand geographic footprint pretty accelerated way . '' went . there's lot money go land data center networking thing go building data center . feel like good geographic presence . feel like best global presence cloud provider . think 's started seeing growth cloud gross margin focused driving eﬃciencies . rather driving geographic expansion , focused , `` okay , 've built lot cloud . get eﬃcient ? '' started vms per server 're kind good stuff really driving improvement gross margin . time , 's competitive market . aws google -- 're focused delivering best price customer . time price coming , 're driving eﬃciencies . key u make sure 're driving eﬃciencies faster gross margin faster price coming . still expand gross margin . feel like 's 're game . got . think potential drive eﬃciencies ? i'm assuming tech , tech software running top - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'harahardware . 's still probably lot eﬃciencies could grind plan . yes , think 's still . also think 's lot expansive growth 've talked . thing would say eventually hit law large number , 're going pretty big number . see abating anytime soon . ultimately , 'll get point think start moderate . right , feel like 's still good growth still good eﬃciencies . got . one thing came last quarter , -- seemed like disconnect 's lot data point investor getting component supplier oems ship hyperscale cloud vendor like , talking sort weakness demand trend sort shipment coming . cloud vendor , including microsoft , saw really good demand trend term sort azure growth dead stable term 76 % growth . capex number still really strong . 's disconnect ? getting -- n't want say bad read . sort timing difference see component supplier versus kind see demand trend revenue trend ? well think part move time , eﬃciencies drive core fabric , example , get utilization server utilization networking bandwidth . -- look series quarter even year core fabric get better , amount hardware . think maybe even though cloud market continues expand fast faster , think equipment perspective , 're getting smarter use -- utilization look like . n't know 'd call disconnect , would say 'm sure growth rate industry simply get better utilization hardware used . linear . got . shifting gear developer , one -- actually , always fond relationship developer good relationship developer . one biggest news item 2018 acquisition github , squarely aimed sort developer community fostering relationship . talk u little bit github ? important acquisition microsoft impact azure side house , , sort environment want developer building stuff ? q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith weissthat 's right . 're happy github acquisition . spirit even talked red hat partnership , started developing good relationship github year ago . satya scott guthrie , example , involved frequently meeting github management team . opportunity came acquire github , 's like brand-new u . clearly existing relationship . customer seeing benefit . management team knew . -- strength . opportunity came , said exactly said , , '' hi . 30 million developer , 30 million-plus developer . '' lot good news think azure . mostly , really embrace developer community . think satya clear articulating look acquisition , really look community perspective , like community serve ? community could benefit cloud ? even github , 're committed making sure github presence major cloud , microsoft cloud . think -- company work together even , 's opportunity educate azure think developing apps top azure . certainly promoting azure github community , github developer . really , 's whatever cloud want build , 're going support . think u , 's community growing community . 's benefit azure , 's great . github -- strength among developer . got . shifting gear oﬃce 365. commercial sort move oﬃce 365 , 'd say , one big success microsoft past three year work outside . think guy would agree half kind unit , seat oﬃce on-premise moved oﬃce 365. thinking world trajectory oﬃce 365 going-forward basis ? 're past peak term unit . enough pricing side hill , , sort sustain type growth 've seeing oﬃce 365 business ? think 's vector term think oﬃce 365 growth . one said 're sort halfway point little past term moving customer . 's still big growth opportunity u even though 're sort point . two e5 offering , example , think there's technology service provide maybe replace existing service maybe augment existing service . look e5 new sku , think 's arpu opportunity really go benefit customer taking advantage stack . third continue push smb space . still think 's seat penetration . arpu may . 's still strong solid . look existing customer base , think new skus like e5 think smb . growth vector oﬃce . - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith wei - david m. o'hara q - keith weissgot . think pushing arpu higher time , think likely , 're going see e7 sku coming corporate given functionality 're thinking today , maybe drop e1 skus push guy up-market force onto e3 e5 price increase start roll oﬃce 365 day ? yes . 're -- would say taking sort random order , feel like customer benefit e1 sku . long customer benefit , 're still going continue offering . think 's always new functionality add oﬃce . team great example . great adoption team tech . personally use internally happy think team . think 're going say likely , 's likely 're going add new tech current oﬃce offering 'll figure best strategy customer monetization . n't look oﬃce say , `` taking price side . '' 's focus u . 're focused adding value customer -- existing offering customer , new current . would say 3 choice , 're likely add offering tech . got . -- mentioned expansion term potential user base . 'm assuming 're talking f1 sku . yes . talk u little bit 's let take oﬃce 365 , value proposition 're giving front-line worker , mean , perspective sort number user ? 's huge expansion potential number user outside core information worker . 's big expansion term number user . monetization obviously different . think 's whole different user maybe , whatever reason old world , oﬃce seen tied pc . n't need tied pc , simple mobile device . type user . think user get organization using oﬃce way , shape form , loyal they're going microsoft . really 's getting expanded presence customer base . couple question . want take chance get question audience question audience . q - unidentified participant - david m. o'hara q - unidentified participant - david m. o'hara q - unidentified participant - david m. o'harayou 've signed lot recent deal large company . exxonmobil last week also walmart , kroger , walgreens , gap , et cetera . view evolution relationship existing customer moving , transformative , large deal ? yes , would say good news microsoft almost company customer way , shape form . lot time , 's existing customer . 's existing customer going whole new opportunity . need basically reframe conversation . personally get spend lot time deal , bigger deal . 're super exciting customer u . 're also looking u sort lead way . 's -- u , 's existing customer renews go process continuing customer . existing customer say , `` need think thing completely differently . ? think ? '' 's . 's like , `` hi . want continue customer . 're help drive transformation . '' addition exxon , announced deal walgreens deal walmart . lot big company want move new world . also mean 're continuing existing relationship . 's case . could talk gaming business integrate cloud going forward see opportunity ? yes , 'm sorry , said business ? gaming business , video gaming business . game business ? u , 've gaming long time . we've watched gaming evolve cloud business sort away hardware think cloud . good news percentage user gaming small , one intense . see gaming growth business u . would describe ? 're unique position sort like saas software running iaa paas gaming , also core offering well infrastructure . think put u unique position optimize also give lot choice gamers . said , lot gaming company popular title running u know q - keith wei - david m. o'haraget distribution . also help drive eﬃciencies . look gaming certainly expansive business u . got . unfortunately , take u right end allotted time . thank much joining u , dave . yes . thanks , keith .
