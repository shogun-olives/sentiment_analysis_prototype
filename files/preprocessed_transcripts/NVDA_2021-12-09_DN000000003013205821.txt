's ross.seymore @ db.com . without ado , n't pas stewart read forward- looking statement . stewart ? great . thanks , ross . thanks u . reminder , presentation contains forward-looking statement . investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business . , ali . excellent . 'm able see slide shared . , see . okay . hey , everyone . 'm going quickly talk drive platform . always talk nvidia 's entire strategy end-to-end provider automotive solution . mean computer car data collection apparatus , able take data car properly calibrated synchronize data , sending cloud build ai model . build model perception , mapping , planning control . build platform help simulate vehicle . drive sim platform run constellation based omniverse , use platform accelerate end-to-end ﬂow av development . believe important differentiator company av 's challenging develop safe av experience company really eﬃcient development ﬂow help easily find issue , root cause issue , fix issue , test issue able okay car . faster , successful av company 'll , 'll see nvidia unique 're investing every part ﬂow . let 's jump next slide . center strategy platform hyperion 8. way think hyperion 8 , essentially think like atx form factor pc , 's form factor automotive . 's computer architecture , 's sensor set , 's software platform run car . drive work middleware software fully integrated cloud . call dgx infrastructure run maglev software . take data come car automated way , label curate , train model simulate . everything connected hyperion platform architecture . customer , aligned hyperion architecture , help across stack design platform , 's easy go one generation next . could architecture based xavier computer , remove xavier computer slide form factor compatible orin computer vehicle design software 's api compatible . 's really easy transition generation generation leverage investment , across car one generation across generation . hyperion central strategy always talk help customer accelerate time market long sort aligned hyperion architecture . next slide . okay . developing av core , need simulation need real world driving . simulation end ground truth av development . -- type data need hard find real world . 's really hard come across , let 's say , something like road debris , like million difference kind debris might find road , 're actually driving , trying get data , never going able find . use synthetic data generation build kind data data actually perfectly labeled photorealistic , built omniverse . gtc , announced ability build synthetic data generation platform , call , omniverse data replicator drive sim . reason build need av development . partner align hyperion architecture , actually synthetic data immediately take help build model handle hard find scenario real world . sort give partner . accelerates development kind appreciate problem 're dealing 're building end-to-end platform . omniverse replicator something exciting 're building ecosystem customer base , help accelerate development like 's accelerated art . go next slide . think really liked neo announced vehicle 're building orin . 's going four orins , 's going go production next year . mentioned top new horsepower automotive . think really mean , n't actually think top important thing automotive , point computing power incredibly important automotive , vehicle software defined 're going get better life . build platform consistently upgradable . talk going xavier orin , hyperion compatible , mean orin , form factor computer designed exactly form factor compatible xavier . swap provide new feature function customer base new revenue generate vehicle . thing atlan . atlan form factor compatible orin , 's really easy go generation generation . 're we're constantly upgrading platform . 're talking chip , sensor set also increase generation ' higher resolution , sensor , diversity sensor , advanced network . thing drive need higher compete car 's 're trying make easy customer sort partner consistently give higher performance make easy leverage investment across generation . next slide . okay . , core strategy view , two fundamental disruption automotive outside electrification course happening . one av experience , self driving software , talk building stack end end delivers av experience , call drive chauffeur want car able essentially virtual chauffeur drive place place , park place place . 'll see 're building entire stack partner ecosystem design module n't want entire stack , want computer . 're welcome take u . actually wanted software either could active safety parking av , give ability scale take u based need want differentiate . also see huge innovation inside car talk concierge experience . mean , take technology like intelligent virtual assistant natural language processing . vehicle , talk car car know everything automobile . something wrong light ross seymore ali kani q - ross seymoreknow . got sign last week said rear light broken car . able say rear light 's broken ? tell , like halogen xenon type light . could order spot . 's fully integrated everything well vehicle fundamentally change experience inside car . two area av -- like automotive company need invest , redefining experience inside car . call concierge . redefine car drive place place , chauffeur experience nvidia investing full stack area . next slide . hyperion platform , 're proud type company 'd like , look think company building disruptive forward thinking software defined platform industry . volvo really exciting work , mercedes-benz , hyundai , nevs , whether 's nio xpeng li auto , 's full self driving company like zoox didi cruise . 're kind partnering , guy partner believe software defined development , building really advanced solution . nvidia successful platform , whether 's level 2 , level 3 , level 4 full self driving across robotaxi truck . go next slide , sort take win together , huge pipeline 's going quite bit larger 're today . next six year , $ 8 billion pipeline , sort span type vehicle talked passenger vehicle commercial vehicle . deal situation sell chip partner full stack situation we're building chip , full self driving solution 're providing end end infrastructure let sort find issue cause fix ota car quickly possible . okay , 's material planned . great . thanks , ali . n't run video ? christian , hit button run video . think plenty time . ( video presentation ) ali , let know video done jump q & . 's done . question answer - ali kani q - ross seymore - ali kaniokay , great . well , jump q & , anybody question email ross.seymore @ db.com . n't kick little bit , approach , end-to-end approach , open modular first slide , best every one aspect pull . believe nvidia truly differentiated ? attempt actual success fully end end , one attribute , whether 's software , simulation , training , hardware , semiconductor side focus semiconductor analyst like ? think truly differentiated ? think 's integrated infrastructure let develop code simulation real world software stack , could actually ota really quickly . basically 'm saying secret sauce software development ﬂow safe secure needed automotive safety standard . one world . like build ai code need safe secure every drop . ca n't release buggy code ota self-driving vehicle . well , build code ai heavy safe secure way , 's software development ﬂow 's end end infrastructure , essentially able really , really hard . one figured 's think nvidia differentiated putting development vehicle , virtual vehicle together really high quality eﬃcient software development . think 's core differentiator . given historically automotive company would iterate natural pace could handle driving real world mile car road sensor , situation could record , et cetera , mapping incident , prevalence diversity , sort thing . oems trusting sim diversion getting endpoint kind something 've earn trust year ? think whole industry know need sim real world together . 's -- 's hard problem heavy vehicle supposed self-driving . ca n't make mistake . 's impossible come across every real-world scenario driving ﬂeet vehicle . 's -- 's hard , right , like imagine life , many time seen something random road . 're building ai code 's supposed figure , 's never seen , handle , case synthetic data generation . take synthetic generation couple see real world , feel like enough diversity av experience diverse . say top , also need diverse av stack , everything based ai . code need vehicle need use legacy method sake , might recognized something , might trained q - ross seymore - ali kani q - ross seymore - ali kaninetwork . need maybe addition ai network see object something little bit legacy optical ﬂow base fuse together . stack 's synthetic generation real world , also element legacy architecture well modern deep learning based architecture , fuse together , -- combination , really disruptive safe self driving experience . nvidia technology point view , customer also -- basically running ? dgxs , constellation , . wanting take technology , whether 's supercomputer enabled development , sell dgxs . kind relationship across open modular capability reside nvidia customer part really ambivalent -- agnostic ? yeah , 's great question , 's always customer . part good kind able explain . case customer n't use u car . buy infrastructure u train network . biggest customer . n't even need use u car , buy chip car someone help dgxs simulation . customer buy chip u strategy training simulation . many case people buying chip u using u training simulation . case people buying chip u , well software car using u training simulation . literally based customer want feel need . fact 're developing full stack end end , give u opportunity help place , 's . many case , expertise n't need help that's great . sort say tell u help help specific way . look 10 year road , think nvidia would adding value car development side equation ? 's balanced . 's mix , think huge lifetime generational opportunity . believe starting today car active safety car , right . 's like keep getting accident . 's really driving , change time essentially every car one day able drive place place . need much higher performance computer much advanced q - ross seymore - ali kani q - ross seymoresoftware car . 're uniquely positioned able deliver kind computer software driving solution . infrastructure , training simulation need active safety really minor . look tesla talk term another building l2 plus experience . really big infrastructure , right . announced , close 10,000 gpus . 've announced . 's big infrastructure . 's l2 plus million car year . 100 million car year , l2 plus l4 . market going many 10 time larger . think 's million car year needed today l2 plus , every car needed l4 . going like 100 time size 's already large business u . think 's one , think 's , think 're generational opportunity . within car , see processing power delivered ? think one chip rule supercomputer trunk diversified distributed around vehicle closer sensor ? nvidia envision 's different company seem attacking different way . course depends 're trying enable l2 plus l 4/5 , envision distribution processing power ? well , think software-defined car , decision criterion platform architecture selection change . 're seeing already vendor like volvo mercedes-benz nevs like tesla , nio , li auto , xpeng . centralizing architecture . reason easier support maintain vehicle life . like -- vehicle 100 computer . ota , update manage c car . 's really , really hard . centralize architecture sort centralized approach , 's easier maintain update vehicle safe secure way , critical av . think see data . think 's , 's doubt whole industry move way already happening 's industry starting recognize really great transformation car becoming software defined vehicle get better day leave lot . going kind create new feature function life vehicle . 's like car best , day sold . get better buy . want architecture 's easy program update . get bigger computer middle . think definitely happen , we're still starting see transition already big way . mentioned 're watching video vehicle self-driving vision-based system , talk sensing modality nvidia support . know n't sensing side , 'd processor data - ali kani q - ross seymore - ali kanithat create . talk sensing modality believe prevalent going forward move l 4/5 ? sensing . like mercedes-benz example , 're going camera perception , radar perception light perception driving stack . think place camera radar passenger car believe get self-driving , need see innovation radar . 's really exciting radar coming imaging radar side . 's possible full self driving camera imaging radar . believe least two sensor modality , case camera see something want redundant way see , right . want second modality . least camera radar , get full self-driving , see need lidar , 're certainly going support lidar hyperion architecture . one platform 're taking market camera radar lidar . think lidar good role deal stationary small object , camera see radar good seeing like piece brick ﬂoor 's moving . radar wo n't even see . kind benefit lidar see . see value lidar well get sort full self driving functionality . question one investor . 'll read verbatim . nvidia system compared tesla self driving software live updated data ecosystem 1 million car road creating storing real data , synthetic data nvidia talking ? okay . think platform side , 're much open , right . , nvidia's platform developer platform , see entire community people building av software platform . rate innovation speed 'll see drive platform really , really fast fastest industry opinion , 's nvidia software development speed versus tesla . customer talked zoox cruise . 're building great software platform sometimes , people want l4 get benefit developer ecosystem drive platform n't tesla person programming tesla tesla . far self-driving experience , mean , showed guy drive 's l2 plus drive . ca n't tesla today . feel like best-in-class . 're really great work . think , tesla xpeng building production car today , best self-driving software . think best option available market . try differentiate developer ecosystem . differentiate even faster u . q - ross seymore - ali kaniand course tried progress faster . think two year ago , tesla driving better . today 're scenario . 'll see end full self driving faster . feel really good investment 're making strategy think speed development ﬂow really critical successful long terminating . great . thanks answer , ali , thanks question audience . anybody else question email . switched business model side equation interesting implication . move autonomy taken longer . 've talking . think 've holding autotech conference seven year something . seems rapidly approaching finally . rub [ ph ] sometimes get pay functionality . guy look like 're getting -- taking different business model least one partner mercedes subscription model . start beginning , 's general cost adder see adding autonomy vehicle , ali ? think get passed along offset way , shape form . change business model customer , necessarily sharing revenue supplier nvidia customer also customer end-user well ? okay . first , know , think fundamental transition industry recognizes vehicle software defined . fundamental change business model pricing strategy . first , software defined platform , want highest performance computer sensor set computer every time release vehicle . guy see iphone , right . 's always best newest slc first launch iphone put best sensor camera , launched vehicle . time , tried sell product relatively aggressively , lot feature function service provision device sold . find customer 're making decision , think like , hey used -- way people still , say , hey , want like cheapest cap car could build . 's something nvidia building thinking software defined . start thinking software defined , say want put best computer best sensor set car , want sell car cost effectively customer base we're going sell service time . business model pricing model change want sell many car , value platform size installed base . 're trying take investment , raise price vehicle . want take investment sell many platform . life , 'll larger installed base . value installed base far important valuable partner , spend q - ross seymore - ali kani q - ross seymore - ali kani q - ross seymore - ali kanilike extra $ 100 computer car . think see transition see customer thinking kind platform . trying increase price vehicle much increase installed base vehicle ability upgraded add new feature function life customer . got . one two minute left . n't ask last question , running -- automotive business nvidia running $ 500 million , $ 600 million year right . talked $ 8 billion pipeline 's think six-year pipeline . walk u , going $ 600 million $ 8 billion $ 1.5 billion annual basis ? 's sort trajectory investor follow ? think first start orange ramp happens sort second half next year . ramp , 've announced win many company . find china nevs go production fastest start [ ph ] faster development ﬂow would expect typical traditional oem . talked see transition happen second half next year . see uptick , 'll see pipeline number . know -- 're running $ 500 million $ 600 million year today , average six year $ 1 billion year , 're going see uptick six year , see attractive growth pipeline timeframe . margin expand whole size installed base focus initially subscription model service model mean maybe margin n't go initially , time nice tailwind behind ? yeah , 's right way think hardware margin hardware margin fairly consistent , software potential scale life car car sold provide increased profit opportunity nvidia . perfect . well , ali , thank much time . know 're exceedingly busy day , 'd like see dog popping saying hi , behind well . anybody question email , get folk nvidia . thanks stewart well . 're time , 'll wrap . thanks , . thank , guy .
