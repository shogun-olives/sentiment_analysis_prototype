( technical diﬃculty ) 're going advance first couple slide . okay . good morning , everyone . thanks joining . 'm crystal valentine , 'm going start today giving brief framework think 's helpful analyze lot market trend 're seeing , especially emergence new technology new paradigm enterprise computing mean legacy technology vendor . 're thinking company whether secular tailwind headwind , hope framework useful . large picture , 're seeing really remarkable fundamental shift way enterprise thinking spending money technology , go type shift transformation every 30 year generation . look macro picture , global technology spend $ 1.5 trillion excluding telco device , grows relatively rate gdp growth , primarily ﬂat . break technology spending constituent component differentiate spending next-gen technology versus legacy technology , see two different story taking place . next-gen technology , inclusive cloud computing infrastructure , well on-premises sort scale-out art [ ph ] infrastructure technology growing year-over-year . contrast , legacy technology investment slowing growth actually starting shrink . actually pas inﬂection point year ago 2015 , actually see decline growth core asset legacy technology company . technology perspective , think explain shift , opportunity save money using cheaper infrastructure cheaper device , instead something much fundamental taking place . still couple trend pretty well studied well understood point converging create shift . first one rapid growth commercially available computing power . 're familiar trend known moore 's law 's especially referring , essentially power commercially available transistor , number calculation per second per dollar basis commercially available market . double approximately every 18 month , equates 40 % compounded annual growth rate . -- chart , show growth , ( inaudible ) scale y-axis , actually includes upper right nvidia gpu chip . precipitating continuing trajectory know moore 's law . time , massive acceleration volume data 's collected analyzed enterprise . study mckinsey estimated 1987 three exabyte data , whereas projecting forward 2020 , looking 44 zettabyte data , 44,000 exabyte data . , course , data volume growing phenomenon also well studied , also see increasing diversity data type 're collecting . 's longer structured crm erp data set large enterprise collecting growing , instead 's largely coming unstructured source weblogs sensor data high definition video , beep audio file , et cetera . , data volume growing enormous rate 's even complicated 're diverse data type . third trend somewhat problematic relative first two trend , growth computing power growth data , 's collected , fundamentally storage access speed i/o speed lagged , growing modest -- much modest rate 20 % compounded annual growth rate compared 40 % compounded annual growth rate competition speed growing . today commercially available hard disk drive even ssd drive achieve 550 megabyte per second i/o speed , mean time take read write data persistence storage memory processor . , fact , fastest data speed get using , example , aws 500 megabyte per second . 's fastest i/o speed achieve commercially . , compute gone faster , data volume increased , storage density gotten greater cheaper , storage access data , right , meant , fact , data storage data access bottleneck . motivated shift architecture . , legacy world , saw predominantly known scale-up architecture , would multiple application potentially running thing like relational database would accessing data stored san traditional na storage device array . bottleneck would controller -- controller device . multiple application , trying access shared data storage device . essentially , -- data i/o speed became fundamental bottleneck . order transcend bottleneck , 've seen shift scale-out architecture scale-out synonymous large -- idea running application instead large cluster , sometimes thousand commodity linux server , inclusive on-premises , scale-out infrastructure technology thing like hadoop-based platform , well public cloud infrastructure service , also scale-out architecture . benefit leveraging scale-out architecture commodity linux server relatively inexpensive , 're able parallelize fundamental bottleneck , data access , computation data storage distributed across large cluster node , meaning processor parallel read local storage device , i/o parallelize across size cluster . , next-gen architecture helped overcome i/o bottleneck . mentioned , also benefit running relatively inexpensive commodity hardware . fundamentally done , change value data , mean , known time value data , value able analyze data order optimize business . 'm showing left legacy value model data . look orange curve top , 's simply demonstrating notion go data data , 's quite valuable . going data incrementally data , add value . point though , reach law large number get diminishing return adding incremental value , curve ﬂattens going towards right . however , using legacy scale-up architecture , fundamentally exponentially growing soft curve , cost storage managing data grew exponentially amount data management , 's green curve . net value , value minus cost upside curve simple calculation find curve maximum , 's - anurag ranaoptimum value -- 's optimum volume data manage order extract value data without incurring higher cost . today , leveraging next-gen infrastructure , scale-out infrastructure , orange curve , value data n't changed , changed cost curve managing storing data . cost slowly growing linear function size data management . 's indeed case 's going exabyte data management two exabyte data management , roughly double cost infrastructure required manage data . , , different net curve , 's value minus cost , optimal value -- optimal volume data store manage order extract value much right , 's much larger volume data really leverage benefit company . , final thought , think world term believe axiomatically true axiom , think true , least , today data essential disruptive application , know data leverage point gaining competitive advantage , disruptive company business model built data-intensive application . second , data volume continuing grow part data -- shifting value model , shifting value curve data scale-out architecture fundamental . finally , -- existing technology today , see data movement data access performance bottleneck , certain implication , meaning solution architecture minimize amount data need moved order application perform going -- going better one require large data movement , whether 's network whether 's i/o data access movement persistent storage main memory computer . 'll pause concludes overview transition question-and-answer portion . question answer thanks , crystal . one thing mentioned area next area development , could form ai machine learning . , look infrastructure company today , talk , whether 's start-up new workload versus legacy company older business model . way think world eventually evolve , whether 's going public cloud model , private cloud model hybrid cloud model ? envision legacy technology spending , mentioned $ 1.5 trillion ? envision shaping , let 's say , next 3 , 5 , 10 year ? - crystal valentine - anurag rana sure . think legacy technology , primarily characterized on-premises deployment indeed secular decline . think public cloud infrastructure offering offer performance , well economic benefit , least short- term company . 're seeing though different rate adoption depending size company analyzing . small company extent , medium-sized company well le technological baggage , potentially le -- made fewer investment large legacy deployment therefore 's easier rapidly adopt cloud needed technology , embrace cloud-first strategy . larger enterprise , fortune 500 company , large bank telecom , et cetera , different calculus , typically made decade worth investment legacy technology , whether 's on-premises data warehousing project , 's legacy etl software investment , expensive embedding decade business logic . straightforward refactor existing software technology , shift public cloud offering . straightforward path , example , teradata customer leverage teradata cloud , something personally would categorize true cloud-needed technology , fact , 's legacy technology , 's simply managed service offering . , think , larger enterprise longer journey public cloud , also becoming savvy idea cloud vendor lock-in , 's consideration 's coming mind larger company , 're thinking ten [ ph ] sometimes longer time horizon future , want understand relationship azure , aws , google going look like , 's going impact business going forward . also make another note believe lot conversation growth public cloud infrastructure missing one critical aspect , , 's true growth public cloud computing fast 's accelerating , actually estimated around 16 % 19 % compounded annual growth rate , lower 35 % compounded annual growth rate growth data volume . large part reason public cloud growing slower data volume , 'd think would little bit closer , 's simply lot data processing actually occurring edge , edge device , thing like connected car even lesser known technology like smart jet engine new jet engine , example , generate 36 terabyte data per engine hour . 's enormous volume data 's generated processed edge never make way public cloud infrastructure , 's important keep mind . 's fairly amazing perhaps start peeling public hybrid area maybe move edge computing . , look - crystal valentine - anurag rana - crystal valentineat -- take look legacy bank , said , lot baggage deal . strategically , best option ? mean , move portion workload public cloud ? move non- critical application refactor ? go hybrid cloud strategy , one , example , aws vmware together pitching microsoft pitching oracle pitching ? sitting bank , would mindset , would strategic direction would take ? yeah , 's great question . , fact , asked question long ago cio , chief information oﬃcer large u bank based new york . question exactly , future data ? think cloud viable location place data ? motivation behind question cognizant fact cloud -- data gravity data cloud , 's becomes -- ( inaudible ) , plenty reason n't want go hassle moving data . belief cloud vendor actually charge move data cloud . question , think cloud 10 year ? relationship azure aws going look like ? every hear story large customer actually hit inﬂection point decide leave cloud altogether re-purpose on-premises data center take , volume data management great . cloud longer economically viable option . , response question , strategy make sense try develop cloud-neutral application . 's way actually resilient change cost unexpected interruption relationship particular cloud vendor . develop known cloud-neutral application run on-premises aws , azure , google , could even leverage combination public cloud infrastructure , set position optionality going forward shoot shift compute data consumption public cloud vendor on-premises data center price consideration dictate . crystal , one thing mentioned data charge , coming lately lot discussion industry contact . perhaps , give u little detail enlighten u 've also heard isv trying figure vendor go , depending data charged ? perhaps , even give u little bit basic cloud vendor charging data leaf come data center , anything around would interesting ? sure . yeah . 's complicated actually make estimate much going spending decide deploy application , example , aws azure . 's complex analysis , 's function many different factor real way know -- project much 're going spending actually run benchmark , actually deploy application cloud check see monthly bill look like extrapolate . factor go determining , paying cloud , course , combination amount , volume data storage , different tier storage capability offer different i/o speed different slas guarantee different price attached . also charge per virtual machine per instance . essentially unit computation , unit computing power 're leveraging . different pricing model well , either use pay-as-you-go sort reserve certain instance exclusive use yearly basis . data movement actually one hardest task understand . , example , within aws , many different geographical -- call geographical region throughout world reason would -- optionality choose geographical region would like leverage 're building cloud application actually different price different geographical region depending supply demand . challenge one main drive [ ph ] leveraging public cloud infrastructure , truly global application , right , 're large multi-global bank , example , customer europe , well north america , would love able minimize latency time take customer interacting website atm time take data leave web-based application atm make public cloud minimum . actually want leverage combination geographical region , combination , example , north america european region . challenge , moving data region , inevitably happen 're trying aggregate across customer , example , talking money [ ph ] . fee , essentially tool moving data geographical region sometimes even tool essentially moving data public cloud back on-premises data center . many sort hidden fee suﬃciently complex application , really diﬃcult get head around total cost going . amazon also , example , number sort homegrown tool offer customer . one different fee associated . particularly cost-effective , think surprise lot people , example , amazon data warehousing product , known redshift . 's mean inexpensive tends large expense customer choose leverage . , course , lock-in problem , reminiscent -- problem legacy data warehouse . - anurag rana - crystal valentine - anurag rana yeah . -- mean , one interesting thing 're seeing public cloud growth gone people trying realizing 's cheap 's written , , guess , 's marketed . begs think , way look , public cloud infrastructure built way provides high amount scalability , back-up agility , thing legacy infrastructure lagged . sometimes , think large bank thinking future , wo n't want create private cloud exact similar specification aws look like try meter internally different department different area way , like would public cloud never worried lock-in issue ? hard create network , cut-off much revenue many employee , make sense try ? yeah . n't know exactly cut-off precisely . would hazard guess see least foreseeable future fortune 500 company maintain organization on-premises infrastructure system essentially annihilate agility usability public cloud infrastructure option . number reason , partially cost , point , 're right , economics deploying really huge volume data public cloud start fall apart , partially also security , especially within financial service see lot conservatism around embracing public cloud mission-critical application sensitive customer data . -- -- 'm sure cut-off going much size company age company . , 're going see company relatively new , relatively young , still would consider large consumer data embrace public cloud way sort larger bank fortune 500 type company would n't , 'm talking company like netﬂix uber , embrace cloud-native architecture paradigm beginning . large extent 's said , ability innovate rapidly infrastructure offered public cloud , fundamentally different paradigm developing application enables agility . n't public cloud infrastructure agile , fundamentally different way writing application . type company even though huge data deployment embraced cloud-native largely benefit , becomes much easier add new feature functionality integrate modern technology like machine learning artificial intelligence , 've embraced modern next-gen application architecture includes leveraging public cloud . - crystal valentine - anurag rana - crystal valentineso case , one interesting , would say , example came across u recently dropbox , mean , started life aws private cloud . saw profitability improved , mean , part due shift , could model others follow say , hey , pharma company lot data transfer region on-premise area , might create network rather using public cloud source ? , think , depends core competency company 's investigation . dropbox somewhat unique fundamentally they're offering storage service . fundamental 're offering storage service job operator optimize cost storing behalf customer . company much interactive sophisticated application , company like uber netﬂix many others really benefiting much sophisticated feature functionality fact application 're writing still much sophisticated dropbox running . , , 's really competitive advantage able leverage machine learning train model quickly deploy , model production quickly whereas dropbox leverage certain modern paradigm like machine learning much , much lesser extent . , think , dropbox somewhat special case . yeah . fair enough . another thing touched upon presentation edge computing . another , would say , driver could lead modernization legacy infrastructure view , today think , going lot data get generated edge n't make back public cloud , reminds kind old on-premise client server world . really , company going use lot sensor , lot computing endpoint , might well private cloud network lot processing power endpoint . 's kind take marriage private public cloud particular case ? , one size , 's decision iot application . think , give another visual relative growth data generated process edge . first , within data center , abstract , sort contextual drawing , talked growth data approximately 35 % compounded annual growth rate , break data 's growing within data center public cloud , data generated process edge , see two different story edge growing point much , much faster even size consumer internet . , data generated on-board car , autonomous driving vehicle generated three four terabyte data per vehicle hour , said , n't even compared -- example , pratt & whitney 's geared turbofan engine , - anurag rana - crystal valentinegenerate 36 terabyte data per engine hour . data actually largely never making public private data center . data largely generated on-board vehicle on-board plane looking anomaly , looking problem helping make real-time decision . , small percentage data aggregated sent back data center subsequent retrospective analysis , decision letter leverage public private cloud infrastructure 're developing iot application , really depends nature application sensitive , example , security concern latency issue , primary concern . latency particularly important application , might either set-up multiple private data center around world , might leverage multiple different geographical region , within public cloud infrastructure one example . cool , thanks . quick reminder , question , please type address . crystal , one thing talk lot , lot marketing hype around , around ai . think ai ? mean , think evolution -- tied public cloud platform , mean really want good , really need aws and/or google kind structure ? could premise world ? thought 's kind leading race point ? , mean , n't envision standalone operation standalone application , 's -- occurs 's 's going embedded application people building . compare different platform , 's first take initial take ? yeah . , obviously , artificial intelligence , machine learning massive secular trend . today , -- cloud vendor trying develop tool platform leverage cloud infrastructure machine learning application , example , tool available public cloud either open source , meaning deployed on-premises , well deployed cloud really interesting . , far , pretty rudimentary tool offered , example , aws acer google actually probably sophisticated one time , 're largely open source . rudimentary tool public cloud vendor making available incentivize net new application implemented leveraging infrastructure . , course , use tool going likely rely apis therefore , lock particular public file vendor foreseeable future . practice , sophisticated machine learning application leveraged enterprise 'm talking thing like deep learning model go autonomous driving even machine learning model - anurag rana - crystal valentine - anurag ranago making recommendation netﬂix . leveraging cloud branded tool . typically much homegrown . 're leveraging open source software 're highly customized order anything that's particularly interesting disruptive , end hire team expert , team phd write highly customized code way sort cookie cutter , public file vendor offering date . offering relatively low featured cookie cutter tool help really basic machine learning application . , think -- 'll probably see continuation merger acquisition amazon , azure google , particular acquire company start-ups , building tool framework enable sophisticated machine learning application development . -- today clear compelling reason leverage one side another , think within academia , google cloud tends little bit preferred within start-ups trying build cloud native application use machine learning aws . tends little bit preferred , course , azure preferred existing microsoft customer . experience ibm 's watson , working thing much longer industry expertise client base . experience ? thought ? yes . , watson would tell -- call cognitive computing . 's true artificial intelligence 's rather old technology , fact . watson fundamentally 's known question answering machine requires enormous amount annual -- annotation input data typically text corpus , -- watson creates semantic math semantic model entity relationship observed within text trained . semantic model representation able answer question . though 's relative -- 's fundamentally somewhat rudimentary least legacy use could loosely called machine learning , n't excite particularly technological standpoint particularly challenging implement process , public instance watson 's fail produce valuable insight , even significant investment , including md anderson , implemented assist cancer patient treatment . , , watson particularly interesting promising technology . 's interesting assessment . thank . one thing mentioned microsoft discussion lot . , look legacy world , 's hard define call vmware shop , microsoft shop closer oracle sap . see new world evolving , prone go one cloud provider , given legacy baggage frankly , n't matter , matter much money willing spend relationship company ? - crystal valentine - anurag rana - crystal valentine yeah . seeing different sale strategy cloud vendor . advantage microsoft think one reason we've seen strong growth azure , company truly hybrid solution . , obviously , existing microsoft customer , idea working known vendor appealing , addition actually offer hybrid cloud environment customer , mean combination competition within private -- customer private data center , well , azure public cloud infrastructure , leveraging really similar technology on-premises cloud . customer similar experience developing running application on-premises cloud , leverage varying infrastructure different motivation , including cost security consideration . amazon n't kind on-premises presence speak therefore , particularly challenging time approaching larger enterprise real requirement around maintaining mission critical legacy application -- deployed on-premises year year . also historically different go-to-market strategy microsoft azure . microsoft sale rep motivated fact , compensated based consumption cloud resource -- cloud compute resource . selling compute capacity actually motivating customer consume cloud compute storage resource sold . 's rep compensated , motivated work much closely partner , isv partner whose software would consume large amount resource azure cloud . aws taken strategy . think might changing within aws , 'm 100 % sure , certainly , azure much stronger proponent isv partner aws , aws partner company somewhat tenuous relationship aws . 's fair . well , crystal , n't question point , delight listening insight . hope sometime big thanks listener . thanks . thank .
