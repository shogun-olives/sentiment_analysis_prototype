're fine . good profitability beverage , drive traï¬ƒc . give u opportunity attach . said , 've tried -- 've trying up-level food offering number year . think la boulange acquisition , 've done . think food 's gone maybe okay quite good . 's customer feedback get . la boulange big part . continue expand build . far sale opportunity , 've grown food percentage total revenue u business kind mid-teens range 20 % last three four year . traction . customer telling u wallet like food . think next five year , think grow another 5 point , roughly double revenue food time period . know , getting 20 % 25 % , lot thing right . think karen's question . capture dayparts correctly . look last couple year , 've driving 2 point food comp pretty much every quarter . we're getting broad-based food offering across entire daypart . 're quite happy 're seeing . hi . could please talk tea segment ? progress 're making teavana ? whether 've shifted tazo 's tea teavana amount starbucks store ? overall plan growth segment ? q - unidentified participant - scott maw q - unidentified participant - scott maw q - unidentified participant - scott mawso teavana starbucks store ? yes . mentioned think opening comment , n't , 'll mention , 've 1 point comp growth tea past quarter . tea 's meaningful part business year . 's 8 % 9 % total revenue range . frankly , given adjacency tea coffee , 8 % 9 % , 's $ 1 billion business , $ 1 billion business u store . think 8 % 9 % , 'd agree better . think teavana bought , much like talking la boulange . feel starbucks coffee , believe platform brand drive significant tea growth across daypart . that's hot tea , 's iced tea afternoon . 've seen recent quarter . particularly limited time offering . right mango black tea lemonade 's 's extremely well . , give u ability , team ability introduce great recipe . we've executed well store . much shift 2014 2015 within tea ? yes . term product offering ? maybe much term product offering , although . would argue better , seasonal offering . would say traction 're getting teavana brand significant . 2014 , drive significant amount comp tea . n't full point . far 2015 , contributing full point comp . 's got tremendous momentum head summer . , 'll go back . 's kind common theme . starbucks give u capability , recipe design . innovation coffee . continue build . brought evolution fresh 've done around juice . 've seen significant uptick profitability juice store . given high quality evolution fresh , 're thing around yogurt parfait space . q - unidentified participant - scott maw - karen holthouse - scott mawthen moved la boulange . food . build platform innovate . teavana 's exact thing tea . think alcohol roughly 75 location . curious could discus evening activation plan might look like next three year . food offering conjunction alcohol offering . thanks . sorry , acoustic n't great . sorry . yes . increased evening program . started really last couple year 30 store 've testing trying understand need evening , offering standpoint , well ambient standpoint . 's right level investment . learned lot time period . based upon success store , 'll ramping evening . 'll add , move 2016 , hundred evening location . 're actively working licensing thing . believe 's real daypart opportunity u . 's beer wine . 's really broader ticket opportunity people generally come small group . someone might order decaf espresso . someone might order tea . someone might order beer wine . might share couple small plate food , said earlier . 's early day . think 're quite encouraged drive .

'll see play . could build platform u . rest mid-single digit comp come kind call core platform . includes espresso , thing like flat white . includes frappuccino , continue comp every year . 's 1 , 2 , 3 point , depending quarter , pretty much every quarter . think 's build going forward . 's underneath , think driving acceleration 've seen recently investment 're making around msr , much sharper marketing . thing 're partner investment , thing we've done labor staï¬ƒng store , helped peak . underlies help deliver category base comp . , 's question audience . 'll continue . 're thinking topline growth , pretty much question today really centered what's opportunity grow comparable store sale ignores opportunity grow unit . 's one express store 's open new york . learned term potential unit address unique real estate location u internationally ? told unmet demand term peak capacity demand versus existing store footprint ? 's one store early day . level transaction 're seeing store 's got 500 square foot . 's third size average store starbucks . 're seeing transaction comparable store much larger . comparable kind average portfolio . 's store across street store 14 wall . 's cannibalization store . picking incremental traï¬ƒc . reduced menu little bit streamline thing store . look forward , think 'll lot opportunity open call express store urban market , u large city . perhaps internationally . think nature question important occasionally get asked , saturation unit growth u ? think ï¬‚exibility 've store format give u lot confidence continue grow 4 % , 5 % , 6 % portfolio growth rate 've growing last year . includes drive-thrus , 've accelerating last year extraordinary drive-thru-only store , express store . 'll start open reserve , starbucks reserve store generally larger footprint , brewed coffee offering might able order clover , pour-over , - karen holthouse q - unidentified participant - scott maw - karen holthouse - scott mawchemex enjoy brewed coffee several different way .

're talking mobile order & pay . yes . think 'll see 're seeing early day 'll see build adoption curve . frankly , kind like build comp period think multiple year . happens launch mobile order & pay 're working build awareness . first group 'll build awareness starbucks reward member , particularly use mobile app . natural adoption curve people become aware , try , like . try frequently . good news adoption curve running business plan . 's higher market 've rolled wave . think roll new york next week , 'll higher , given density store market . think 's way achieve mid-single digit comp think number year . minute left . final wrap-up question , 's hard imagine really part story people n't excited right . piece think maybe misunderstood people missing opportunity , would ? think always remind people mid-single digit comp double- digit revenue growth company $ 20 billion revenue . try grow 10 % year top line 15 % 20 % year bottom line $ 5 transaction , need number thing going . 'll always number investment rebuild mid-single digit comp . think get - karen holthousequestion lot ca n't deliver well 20 % . thinking high-single digit ? 's -- take enormous amount focus execution grow $ 20 billion company across geography . well guess , wrap webcast presentation move breakout , although 's actually going stay room . 's pretty large fireside chat breakout .
