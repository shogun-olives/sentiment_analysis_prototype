okay . well thank , everybody , -- , attending event . we're super honored cfo microsoft , amy hood . amy , thanks coming vega attend event . thank . definitely kind town . 'm happy . think 's perfectly appropriate microsoft luncheon keynote . 'm exaggerating say microsoft one amazing success story enterprise tech last five year . mean , n't long ago talked microsoft , growth relatively modest . story smartphone going kill microsoft stock 20 . look today , 's public cloud story , growth approaching mid-teens stock 110. , 's amazing . 'm sure behind scene , took lot work make happen . outside , 's fun story watch , amy . yes , would describe work . yes . 's -- n't happen . yes , agree . amy e. hood karl emil keirstead q - karl emil keirstead - amy e. hoodyou 've got proud change 's happened microsoft . . 'm proud team . team 's done really nice job . 's nice part something like , play small role . team done amazing job past 4.5 five year term realizing ambition , setting ambitious goal could , every day , working achieve culture allows achievement . feel great still feel happy excited come work felt got job , right ? that's ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) want ) . 's fun . yes . 's good . question answer well microsoft team done lot good thing . maybe 'll start q & external benefit helped along . long ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) microsoft rarely gave commentary earnings call sort state spending backdrop . n't want play part economist . last couple quarter , amy , 've gone way , n't know whether 's right term . voice view feel good enterprise spending robustly . wanted start asking whether 's still case . given conversation , feel factor drove fairly robust enterprise spending environment 2018 , think leg next year ? feel ? let back first . 15 year ago , writing earnings script others read , actually comment macro geo spend . n't -- want think 's new thing excited opine . would , first , theme , meant make grand statement inclusion , simply statement look u , unique seat , business . within , think said end july , important thing control thing control . say , `` fine . spend ? '' seems like felt , , right , fine . bigger issue , execute well matter environment find ? , really , 2 thing , right ? pick market execute , whether engineering , marketing , sale , finance , et cetera . , feel great market 've chosen . amongst highest grower overall market called gdp whatever spend bucket want put . secondly , feel quite good execution within , product portfolio , competitive positioning day-to-day execution market . think u , important thing set great example focusing q - karl emil keirstead - amy e. hood q - karl emil keirsteadthings control . tends , think , manage inside company . got . okay , make sense . maybe zero part microsoft story . azure might le 10 % revenue . 's probably least half inbounds get . start ? 's couple interesting dynamic happening within broadly azure bucket , saas em business certain growth rate . 've got consumption- based core azure certain growth rate . get blend . talk little bit relative growth rate 2 piece shifting last year next year ? sure . think maybe 's best , point , talk dynamic sit underneath . em business , really , -- field organization customer , azure em business would feel much like 's part oï¬ƒce microsoft 365. 's sold way . 's sold per user basis . thing sold per user , tend different dynamic . seeing simply dynamic . amazing growth story u . em business probably one largest multibillion-dollar franchise 's built , certainly u . offer tremendous value customer . 's always sits -- believe sustainable business customer value . em certainly offer . dynamic ultimately look far like think oï¬ƒce , right ? saas-like margin . 's sold per seat . 'll installed base growth . 'll arpu growth opportunity add new feature . use kind lingo , e3 e5 . could apply language product . 'm excited big . 'm surprised -- 'm excited value offer . 've good execution . dynamic look different , gross margin structure business , quite high . `` rest '' azure lot thing 've always talked exciting . represents one largest tam expansion opportunity think ever existed . see continuing large expansive . every time spend time thinking large , feel like larger . applicability number -- excitement around development often utility across every industry across every country , high . business , think , little different , right ? tam n't set user , tam set workload . mean bit multiplying factor workload changed disrupted transformed , guess , word 'd like use . business -- increasingly large base . growth rate mitigates . growth rate , seen , remained quite healthy , even base gotten larger larger . got . amy , think trying model azure , u trying , one thing look , increasingly , , felt like azure , early day , pay-as-you-use model . lot large enterprise become azure customer make large upfront commitment , lot commitment - amy e. hood q - karl emil keirstead - amy e. hooddo n't sit intelligent cloud revenue piece , sit balance sheet , unearned revenue backlog . 's certainly tricky know much backlog unearned revenue increase attributable azure tricky try waterfall subsequent azure revenue . maybe could comment sort much balance sheet uptick due azure commitment . guidepost offer translate subsequent azure revenue ? tricky ? 's tricky per se . 's different dynamic . go back conversation , em coming balance sheet onto p & l look like oï¬ƒce dynamic , right ? mechanism . 's like subscription . azure , general , recognized 's used . pacing utilization , balance sheet p & l , absolutely different rate . simplifying fact , 'm sure , ratable , fine . people know signing big commitment mean nothing p & l get used . mind -- think said pay-as-you-go . way hit p & l quite similar , right ? 's -- move get used . think maybe different leap think may make sound tone question . 's talk importance driving utilization consumption , 's much motion field focused customer success . customer success thing make ï¬‚ywheel work business like azure . project picked well , value , customer derives value , meter spin . revenue come p & l . without , without customer success , without customer value , without focus customer deployment project picking , wo n't right dynamic . 's spend much time investing sale force , whether 's technical capability , direct interaction customer , project project success increasingly , everything putting people ground making sure customer support world-class . thing drive customer outcome . direct way , leader , make sure thing come balance sheet p & l business make sure process easy smooth customer could possibly , opposed thinking accounting construct . yes . got . okay , make sense . maybe , amy , moving little azure broader , `` on-premise '' server product business . 's another big success story microsoft . 's giant business , sql server window server . suppose couple year ago , many would argued business slowly decelerate workload transition successfully public cloud model . yet 's actually -- growth hung remarkably well , put terrific quarter . think variable business fiscal '19 , ? give confidence maybe , big enterprise server product business hang something close , call , low mid-single-digit growth rate put ? q - karl emil keirstead - amy e. hood q - karl emil keirsteadin general , people really want decomponentize kpi would prefer . server kpi talk lot , server product service kpi , really mechanism see success hybrid architecture sold customer . one match sale motion value prop customer ... azure plus ( business prop ) ? 's azure plus on-prem component . reason 's important think collectively . 'll talk dynamic sit underneath on- prem number specifically , sale motion customer increasingly want want understand best utilize , whether on-prem cloud , value architecture 've ( built ) ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) . feel like focused hybrid five year ago started talking . think market moved increasingly talk value hybrid . 've architected way beginning . real customer value choice , timing . seen value customer , whether purchase sql server license whether ultimately use sql server license hybrid -- azure hybrid benefit azure data service pool , great outcome , mostly 're great outcome customer 's given choice value . accounting construct land one place , 'm really happy follow 100 % compliant way . message first kpi , say , `` people making commitment vision compute , storage , data . '' whether buy one licensing mechanism azure commit , 'm probably focused maybe individual model builder would . said , dynamic impacting on-prem number , 2. one hybrid benefit talked , add ï¬‚exibility price benefit deep value customer , allows ï¬‚exibility using license right cloud small price premium . massive price advantage customer utilize right take workload cloud . secondly premium mix . 've continued see increasing premium mix , obviously come arpu increase on-prem . -- recent release , value , 've continued see . 's consistent driver , would say , on-prem number time . newer driver would hybrid benefit available ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) okay . 'd also love ask ( ) core oï¬ƒce business microsoft . obviously , 's another big success story , n't think many people year ago , given size , maturity business , would thought commercial oï¬ƒce growth rate could 10 % -plus staying level . congratulation . think spent part career microsoft unit , n't amy ? - amy e. hood q - karl emil keirstead - amy e. hood yes , . . 've spent long time microsoft . 've almost every unit ã¢â‚¬â€œ many year . okay . yes . well 's amazing success . wanted ask sustainability , 're getting , obviously , deeper on-prem 365 shift , deeper e1 e3 shift . look growth driver oï¬ƒce business fiscal '19 , couple would encourage u focus attention ? well 'm sure 's per se . logic -- value offer customer , 've tended sell particular business suite . investment 've made past couple year meant make suite work terrific across multiple endpoint , multiple operating system . many people 's mind , would show investment mobile application well mobile application ' ability work across io android device people use addition window experience . 've also invested new workload new value , always plan , would say oï¬ƒce 365 maybe broadly microsoft 365. value 've added past year generally manageability , security , communication thing like team collaboration ( tool ) ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) . value -- also add analytics think progress 've specifically made power bi past year , -- probably best year 've business long time . look say , `` wow , playbook new one u , '' look say , add value suite come mean far people word , excel powerpoint . represents many tool use every day get job done , whether 's onedrive , really terrific year , specifically onedrive business , whether that's team 's momentum 're seeing , especially 've launched viral motion well team . -- whether 's power bi . start define redefine oï¬ƒce broad suite tool , could see concept saying , `` wow , installed base could n't grow . '' and/or could n't charge per seat . add value , provide good value price . continue believe 've added lot feature provide great value . say , `` well amy , guess 're adding 's really arpu story . 's installed base story ? '' installed base story really growth small business , make ton sense . ability access type tool modern consistent n't resource , seems relatively obvious , 's still lot runway business global basis . feel quite good . place 're excited call first-line front-line worker scenario , allows u even grow installed base inside enterprise . 've seen u talk possibility hololens scenario . think hololens many extension another endpoint oï¬ƒce , reach new user , new experience . also mobile-only , also really good opportunity u , q - karl emil keirstead - amy e. hood q - karl emil keirstead - amy e. hoodespecially emerging market , product like kaizala , tend think mobile oï¬ƒce-type product . emerging market u another way add installed base . amy , listed number feature add-on , like power bi onedrive team security . force picking favorite . -- 1 2 perhaps 's others 're excited coming fiscal year next ? think way , business big , want 1 favorite . many way , 're -- go different opportunity . opportunity team go opportunity power bi go . -- value bring suite , stickier know lower know churn . workload get deployed , real focus u , better higher value ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) customer endpoint , really matter . okay . maybe , amy , ï¬‚ip gaming , 's right . 's spotlight . go e3 talk phil , 's jacked future gaming . maybe could talk little bit . think 's number dynamic going . need careful model sector microsoft coming super robust fiscal '18 . want careful getting carried away growth expectation . hand , 's really interesting stuff going gaming , namely cloud gaming , et cetera . mind addressing outlook ? yes . 'll lack maybe passion phil , grown business built spend life , 's -- 's special sense connectivity get phil say . 'll best phil impression , optimism equivalent , even delivery . would ask everybody step back second gaming . gaming , way , u , would urge everybody think another incredibly interesting workload exists worldview intelligent edge intelligent cloud . chance listen satya 's partner sort deck speech , would urge spend time , want understand sort 're -- fundamentally , 's understanding vision intelligent edge intelligent cloud . within , way think gaming way think 've increasingly thought gaming another first-party workload , different dynamic oï¬ƒce , ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) ( sims ) , 's made different viable expressive built cloud intelligent . workload allows u build cloud 's built different latency expectation , different usage pattern , different level 3d , different level interactivity . 's one best expression digital transformation business , q - karl emil keirstead - amy e. hood q - karl emil keirsteadthe way transaction occur , in-product , user-led , user-loved . said , `` well want every product ship microsoft , '' look exactly way gaming . 'd want passion emotional reaction get excel , want everybody get workload build . gaming fan love . 's absolutely reason people ca n't feel expressiveness . gaming great personification 're trying accomplish . endpoint . made better enablement cloud . developer , call gaming cloud , able utilize azure , build best gaming cloud , run first-party ( service ) . -- great content . know developer want . 's reason feel like owning dynamic make u great partner saas platform , reason oï¬ƒce make u great platform saas provider . make cloud better richer . think grade cfo , would said , `` wish would talked gaming way past five year , 's absolutely way 've seen said priority opportunity u . '' also happens pursuit played across device . 's really user- centric lead -- many way , play strength platform company . 've seen maybe third-party gaming success past couple quarter . show software service kpi , think referencing , karl , think , come modeling . company great success game , , , benefit platform people come , purchase interact xbox . business 've transitioned quite bit . 'll hear u . 've done -- think maybe -- n't know 's little year , talk xbox service kpi really ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) ( important ) one u . 's ability continue monetize user build incredibly healthy platform . 'm really proud team . 's place -- 'm sure 've gone many e3 conference talk ai research team . team one aggressive adopter ai technology one important partner azure team 've ever seen . really show 're able provide customer . actually -- n't spend ton time playing xbox , 's team 'm really happy advocate , made world difference u . think phil would proud impersonation . 's pretty good . 're $ 10 billion business . 'd better able talk . that's goal . well one . 's cloud gaming front . could zoom , know lot people audience early stage maybe along thinking 's going play . surface , seems like microsoft actually pretty well positioned . azure leverage . 've got , said , first-party content . 've got long-standing relationship third-party developer . seem 're well positioned . think uncertainty time frame evolve . thought - amy e. hood q - karl emil keirstead - amy e. hoodthat ? know 're going tell u 's going take next year . maybe challenge getting liftoff ? sense become reality ? well 's sort interesting . actually feel 's quite realistic today look gaming company globally adoption azure platform , even maybe 've launched specific tool help gamers . 's absolute recognition gaming enhances experience end user . cloud enhances gaming experience end user . make easy use easy developer , better . made acquisition space playfab , think great interesting strategically important transaction u . 're even starting see early success game pas , game subscription . opportunity u , taking content others ' content , package make sure people able play game love . predictive way . 's really think interesting transitional moment gaming 're able watch quite quickly , type game played . they're making money . ability commerce platform , user-centric behavior , platform broad adoption , content cloud , think , strategic advantage u . think already see kpis ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) year . feel confident 's long-dated concept . okay . 's encouraging . ï¬‚ip github ? thought , super interesting acquisition . microsoft indicated pretty publicly oversimplify , 're going leave alone sensitive open source github community . hand , obviously , want extract synergy github . maybe could talk -- might premature , given n't think deal closed yet . plan . maybe ca n't go , broadly strategy . yes . n't raise teeny bit , 'll talk -- 'll answer github . 've seen pretty consistent logic come acquisition space especially larger one . said , `` well , team , satya i. management team , leadership team , done term large acquisition together ? minecraft , linkedin . we've announced github , , rightly point , closed . went list said , `` well common surface , '' might say little . really common quite bit . number one , 're believe structurally important growing market . matter applied , -- linkedin going important growing part professional network gig economy professional identity , people professional identity move online ? course . course , global basis . minecraft symbolic ability spread gaming across mobile , pc console way n't possible ? course , . q - karl emil keirstead - amy e. hood q - karl emil keirsteadgithub representative believe largest growing one largest growing important group worker world ? yes , developer . today , modern devs sophisticated devs view github home . increasingly , believe growth developer . incredibly sophisticated developer . developer skill everybody every company across world going need type digital transformation u believe occurring across industry . absolutely see growth number developer ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) . believe ability ability support github's mission , make developer effective educated trained impactful , tool microsoft visual studio , v code one interesting product 've built company . support provide tool expose tool support github 's mission growing market , 's great thing . great valuable thing . 's beyond . say , `` okay . great . consistent point 've made 's tam expansive . '' additional point made happen generally also network community . actually thought , connected , tend actually reasonably sticky tend communal aspect contribution , come value . 's talk -- get value , every time somebody say word synergy , get little nervous , absolute important thing network community community guide future , support exists , right , remember exists remember grows . synergy wo n't come way think many people normally think word . apply logic either prior largest acquisition 've done either . next thing would say , logical best owner , right ? feel like asset correlated company ? felt really strongly . linkedin professional , minecraft expanding gaming strong position ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) ( add ) github , many many year developer company . 're platform company , 're developer company . ( speaks ) ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) . feel good github . look forward getting closed . could thrilled leader 've chosen . nat friedman absolutely right person focus making github great , keeping github , , wanted buy . quite excited brings u . importantly , mean future development next ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) . okay . helpful . maybe , amy , last 6 7 minute , 'd love hit couple financial question , could . one ... kind think one , . 're welcome ask . perhaps one slightly . feel like messaging microsoft team , look fiscal '19 broad question growth margin , 's tilted little bit towards growth camp , feel like - amy e. hood q - karl emil keirstead - amy e. hooda lot larger business performing well year focus rather focus driving material operating leverage . , broadly speaking , directionally least , right framework fiscal '19 ? 'm sure 's new framework . fy '18 , pretty focused growth . continued invest area felt expanding tam strong position ability land revenue . n't think 's actually change u look '19 , see expanding tam , see opportunity , feel well positioned . n't feel constrained investing . continue feel constrained investing going forward . take step back look opex guidance gave 7 % , think cost living , massive opex number . n't think meaning send deep message -- 're continuing focus 've always focused , , continue work portfolio get highest roi -- matter number 're investing ? actually even reï¬‚ect back guidance gave july , -- clear say , expect fy '19 operating margin slightly . 'm believer year , message actually far consistent maybe would see different , feel really good execution . feel great market 're . want make sure invest take capture opportunity revenue . want focus customer success . want see land customer satisfaction . want u continue focus gross margin improvement business 're . want u stay focused lose passion around making sure every dollar spend spent highest roi see possible . 'm sure mindset wildly different . actually might describe 'm pretty consistent . okay . 's helpful . maybe time one . 's question 'm getting little bit lately . 's around capital allocation , amy . mind sharing u current view around use cash , apart obvious , restart buyback post github , think know . 's framework would encourage u think around capital allocation day ? 've consistent point . -- view capital return meaningful component total shareholder return . 've believed long time . especially past year , 've focused using buyback dividend tool one tool . first , might imagine , mostly daily existence focus 're investing capital organic growth , continuing look inorganic opportunity , whether small size , 've seen u use well , tool . feel good return 've gotten especially larger acquisition we've made inorganically use cash . n't see difference we've continued view . think remains important component satya well management ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) board focus . n't think q - karl emil keirstead - amy e. hood q - karl emil keirstead - amy e. hood q - karl emil keirsteadchanged today . 's commitment ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) rather anything else . okay . make sense . well 've covered lot ground . congratulation , amy , amazing success story microsoft last couple year .
