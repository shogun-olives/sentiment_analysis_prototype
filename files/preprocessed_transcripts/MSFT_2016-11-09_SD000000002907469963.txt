( technical diﬃculty ) -- microsoft conference today . microsoft , takeshi numoto . takeshi cvp enterprise cloud ; run marketing function . front row , mat mcbride . work takeshi , senior director finance business unit . , course , omnipresent zack moxcey investor relation . zack asked read little regulatory blurb . . begin , microsoft may make forward-looking statement presentation . refer sec filing risk factor relating business . 's true whether person listening web . , takeshi , let 's start . maybe start role . first , help u understand actually day-to-day role . adjunct , 've microsoft 20 year , would love get perspective microsoft today relative microsoft 've seen last number year . first , name takeshi numoto . 'm corporate vice president cloud enterprise marketing . 'm responsible basically going market driving worldwide marketing strategy microsoft application platform infrastructure service server product . includes product like azure public cloud service , well on-prem server product , window server , sql server , software tool like visual studio portfolio product , well business application around dynamic 365. get work wide portfolio product . 've company 19 year , quite 20 year yet . started actually one engineer window nt . 've around . ross macmillan takeshi numoto ross macmillan takeshi numototruly inspiring see customer technology day transformational impact business . 's really exciting time . 's great . let 's start azure . math , 's $ 3 billion revenue run rate business . 's actually accelerating , kind amazing scale . also pretty amazing think probably five year ago pre- revenue . amazing business -- according math . according math . maybe let 's talk differentiator . know microsoft player . know friend amazon aws really kind maybe [ ph ] catalyst market . let 's talk make microsoft different 're talking customer . think 's great question . think lot cloud dialogue see , people focus specific property , azure oﬃce 365 individual portfolio . important . u one key thing rallying behind whole notion microsoft cloud . talk microsoft cloud , 's basically handle representing commercial cloud service offering . includes azure constituent service underneath azure , well oﬃce 365 dynamic 365. think differentiation highest level , individual property level . microsoft cloud differentiated , think really boil three thing . one global scale reach offer . take azure region example , one region -- talk azure region , 's one data center ; 's essentially logical representation multiple data center within sort network latency represent one logical construct customer . 's large-scale thing essentially span multiple data center time . 38 . essentially offer choice customer partner term deploy solution closer market , closer customer , closer company -- partner employee . 's huge benefit offer . 's -- think really sort ( inaudible ) enterprise requirement , u one key design point microsoft cloud really designing enterprise -- enterprise requirement afterthought . relates second point sense notion really meeting enterprise-grade requirement , 's something 've privilege working many , many business customer size , large small . really feel like sense going deep customer understanding business requirement investing need . technology . engage customer , support lifecycle product consumption . part really making sure helping comfortable us technology cloud . trust huge element . , 've , deep investment sort security capability , well compliance certification . everyone [ ph ] think compliance certification , compliance certification global cloud vendor . 's horizontal certification , whether talk numerous certification around iso , iso , well soft one , two [ ph ] , also vertical one like kitsa [ ph ] pci whatnot . broadest portfolio compliance certification essentially designed reduce increased comfort confidence trusting customer able use cloud . 's really paying well . , thirdly really hybrid . think approach , know despite fact reason giving choice customer able deploy application solution closest targeted area , also want build region every country every geography . whole notion able offer solution let customer essentially use prem . almost enterprise customer investment on-prem asset . building technology 's really deep comprehensive . let use already prem thing cloud . taking synergistic copacetic sale something feel like uniquely positioned provide cloud service . also deliver software customer use premise . , enables u go beyond hybrid sense narrowly connectivity . oftentimes , get talked 's connectivity thing connect prem cloud . 's much deeper . oftentimes , maybe people talk infrastructure , hybrid sense may able move storage around compute around . u , hybrid far deeper . 's really platform consistency . productivity , like oﬃce 365 , way thing like application platform data platform like sql , identity management like -- baked actually deep hybrid way infrastructure , way ross macmillan - takeshi numotoup application layer . feel like 's something 's really resonating customer . three thing , global , trusted . hybrid . last point , kind dovetail little bit commentary around higher tier service , 's big message microsoft , think evolution azure service , 's continuing add incremental value stack . curious . think customer journey azure , way u sort think typically approached , customer start . look customer advanced platform , going ? question answer think consistent pattern see customer ' journey cloud , regardless entry point . mean different customer start different asset cloud . customer start essentially consuming saas service first . might go deploy oﬃce 365 might deploy dynamic 365. 's first entry cloud consumption . cloud customer start infrastructure . okay , want drive storage cloud move virtual machine cloud . 's kind infrastructure-centric approach . third ( inaudible ) essentially customer saying want essentially net new thing cloud . on-prem investment , 'm going continue harvest . net new application , particularly one extend capability already premise , perhaps web , mobile device , cloud provides great leverage point able . think application modernization , new application . typical three entry point customer start using cloud . common pattern see matter start amongst three entry point , end needing element , saas infrastructure higher- level service . whether machine learning whether face detection voice detection thing like , application cloud consumption pattern basically become increasingly sophisticated customer need vendor essentially address portfolio need business . think , , sort feel uniquely positioned azure . microsoft cloud approach able offer thing need journey cloud . includes also thing like - ross macmillan - takeshi numoto - ross macmillan - takeshi numoto - ross macmillanmanagement security capability , advanced analytics data level -- data service would probably classify higher-level service . thing 've embraced open source way microsoft historically done . 've made comment much 30 % workload , think , running linux o opposed traditional microsoft window o . important messaging important customer consider azure ? think 's huge boon cloud business , frankly , become really clearer around sort core goal around driving azure consumption end furtherance customer ' business transformation cloud . , course continued invest heavily software ip asset . great customer use software top cloud . 's kind best combination software purview . basically , particular individual product goal , essentially driving cloud adoption . helping customer transform business broad consumption cloud primary goal . order , really deeply embrace notion basically want [ ph ] pursuing kind , pro ( inaudible ) kind bring skill set consumer cloud based skill set already . invested heavily operating system support linux variant . also lot open source-based framework , whether database level language level , name , low dev [ ph ] , python , php . we've invested deeply able recruit developer skill set able productively use azure . like said , one-third -- quarter azure vms one-third region running linux ( inaudible ) cloud right . 's huge ( inaudible ) standpoint 's exciting u driving new growth . yes . 's let 's ingest workload regardless platform . 's good thing microsoft . yes . last thing wanted touch azure . maybe little esoteric . 's something amazon done . guess 's called nomenclature service -- serviceless computing . function lambda . microsoft something called azure function . - takeshi numoto - ross macmillan - takeshi numoto - ross macmillan - takeshi numotoand hear . wanted spend minute . maybe could talk u getting airtime ? becoming something hearing market ? well 's basically sort talked serverless compute , basically 're essentially server running time may idle . actually able compute capacity demand something invoked , message come signal come . right processing time right . actually shuts job done . 's kind whole notion , whether 's lambda azure function . 's one -- another element essentially cloud computing bringing eﬃciencies overall compute . think overall journey , started basically bare metal server . would virtualize . mean actually virtualize essentially pack virtual machine given hardware box overall hardware utilization higher . kind another way take next step . wo n't address customer scenario . best , sort fit -- 's purpose fit thing would n't initially use every scenario . 's certainly one scenario extends cloud computing eﬃciency something offer azure function well . boost eﬃciency vendor provisioning standpoint . also customer standpoint . prepurchasing compute capacity ; buying , , reserved instance . basically putting app consume need demand arise . exactly . yes . let 's talk little bit oﬃce minute . 85 million active user commercial oﬃce 365 product , really impressive . thing that's really interesting see growth still 40 % . guess one question , clear oﬃce 365 actually driving new user platform ? held analyst day maybe year half ago talked unit growth within oﬃce franchise . 'd love talk minute . oﬃce 365 able term attracting new user platform product think pretty mature ? - ross macmillan - takeshi numotoyes . background , right , actually 've current role four year . , actually got eight year working oﬃce , including actually launching oﬃce 365. 's great see ( technical diﬃculty ) 'm different role oﬃce 365 -- growing seeing tremendous success customer . 're right ; 40 % see [ ph ] growth actually representing , think , 56 % revenue growth . 's see growth . 's actually driving average revenue per customer well growing . one phenomenon’s 's really encouraging u see oﬃce 365 momentum actually resulting increasing install base oﬃce . n't pure substitution ; 's actually adding overall install base oﬃce . 's great impact . , actually moving selling pure essentially desktop application , like word , excel . powerpoint , actually selling service includes email , includes collaboration 're seeing reﬂected essentially upper uplift . seeing install base increase upper uplift . 's great see . 've driving higher tier skus , well , e3 , e4 , e5 . offer , 're adding whether 's business intelligence capability unified communication capability . something expect sort - - path , , could see value , higher tier skus . sort , , sit continuum sort higher arpu time ? think 's logical thing u continue think . like think transition 've oﬃce 365 essentially traditional license business perhaps highest economic case lifetime value standpoint take transactional customer may bought license every year subscription relationship . certainly increase way deliver value customer therefore increase lifetime value customer . , certainly also want increase aperture value deliver . whether going pure desktop set application plus collaboration communication . , okay , 's certainly seeing see growth arpu growth , like talked . next step continue drive . 's logical u say , hey , additional value subscription relationship add . right , ca n't talk 's next . right 're really excited opportunity around oﬃce 365 eply [ ph ] offer , certainly really seeing lot resident customer security value - ross macmillan - takeshi numoto - ross macmillan - takeshi numotoproposition represents . also really liking fact also let u -- offering essentially position u participate additional adjacent market opportunity area , like business intelligence voice . security , obviously last couple year number acquisition microsoft security domain . maybe high level help u understand 're weaving new security functionality oﬃce azure on-prem product . feel like 's become elevated part strategy . absolutely . particularly work customer help take advantage cloud , security huge issue want make sure address . one thing focused essentially drive security intrinsic part workload deliver . thinking security kind bonus [ ph ] product side . security infused additional capability oﬃce 365 , security infused intrinsic value proposition window , security infusing part manage mobile device em . , seeing tremendous amount success across product portfolio whenever infuse security value proposition workload go market , whether 's oﬃce 365 , whether 's m , window mass [ ph ] threat protection . , essentially also making easier customer sort secure employee base across board offering called secure productive enterprise . make super easy customer one transaction cover employee , whether 's security technology window , security technology baked oﬃce 365 , across device em , enterprise mobility suite , grew 85 % ( technical diﬃculty ) tremendous amount success . 's kind approaching term infusing security deeply workload deliver essentially making sure work seamlessly across . monetized , said , infusing product portfolio becomes part offer ? basically , 's -- lot time 's part higher edition offer . security always one thing want make sure even baseline product secure . want able layer additional value proposition perspective . - ross macmillan - takeshi numotoand , oﬃce 365 e5 one let way layering strategic value proposition top base oﬃce 365 workload . window enterprise essentially also delivers additional enterprise treatment ( technical diﬃculty ) additional security capability top would get window subscription , well em essentially let deliver mobile device management mobile application management across device able deliver security capability . think essentially value proposition infusing product . also layering top workﬂows . great . last thing wanted touch , announcement earlier year , dynamic 365 business . maybe high level talk u , 's different dynamic 365 versus dynamic . customer standpoint would look say new , something n't get microsoft ? taking different approach dynamic 365 traditional way bizapp , think , vendor gone market , sort segregation different functionality business processing piece . sort notion crm versus erp separate . separation largely sort vendoring use notion sense customer standpoint , want able solution go lead way cash order fulfillment . basically dynamic 365 , we've essentially unified traditional used crm erp offering one cloud service go across entire business oﬃce lead order fulfillment way . time unifying , 've also made modular purpose built n't buy monolithic mixing [ ph ] end end . start one business process want address . want start customer service , . want use u field service process service automation customer sale automation , get going , knowing fully well 's essentially future proof future expansion address application business process move forward . that's kind different approach thinking marketplace . also building top goodness azure capability , higher-level service , take advantage . 's infused would think intelligence capability , whether thing like essentially building model customer use product thing like inventory stockout alert , able relationship helping customer ' sale automation depending -- regardless human judgment ability close deal , actually say , hey , deal really going close based relationship help observed customer engagement system . - ross macmillanso think infusing business -- connecting business process across different area . essentially letting customer start wherever want , knowing fully well 's future proof expansion . great . 'm conscious time ; coming end slot . could probably go another half hour , easily . breakout ; across way . takeshi , thank much coming today . appreciate .
