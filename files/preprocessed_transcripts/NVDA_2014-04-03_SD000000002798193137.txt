okay . great . well pleased chris eveden nvidia come chat u bit nvidia today . thanks much chris . perhaps start gpus . mean nvidia gpu company . used nifty graphic desktop . 've actually broader quite considerably 've done gpus . could run sell gpus day roughly revenue breakout ? yes , sure . describe visual computing company , reﬂects fact core activity say gpu . wrap differently take different market . take gaming market graphic driver . 'll wrap professional software driver give u quadro business , professional graphic . 've built whole ecosystem around power computing , cuda platform . give u tesla product . built hypervisor gpu well . 's new grid business going come . four business use exact piece silicon , although different price point . different piece silicon different price point . exact piece silicon . difference value put software ecosystem put around . 's come . even tegra , tegra gpu , . wrapped -- , whole bunch software , ecosystem . also silicon well . 's system chip 's tegra business . david wong chris eveden david wong chris evedenbut 's leveraging ip 've got core competence , like , gpu . look much effort put , actually software engineer hardware engineer . although categorized -- know semiconductor analyst , categorized semiconductor company , make decent case fact software company make gpus run software . 's -- 's business structured . term revenue , let see approximately head . geforce around 60 % , quadro around 20 % , tesla around 5 % , tegra around 15 % . got ? get 100 % . want get 105 % ? probably , yes , 's well 's licensing stuff like always . 's broad rule thumb . that's look business . impressive . within 60 % ( multiple speaker ) 's -- ( multiple speaker ) yes . divide two market . geforce pc product pc consumer . divide market two segment call gaming oem . 's really -- used think desktop notebook , easy knew chip going form factor . n't actually informative end market . gaming oem actually almost gaming almost entirely desktop oem almost entirely notebook . quite . gaming notebook oem desktop . 's also much informed way looking market , segment different behavior . gaming segment strong . 's growing high single digit year , probably whole market whole . asp strong . 's market -- someone buying pc play game specific need pc , whereas oem business -- oems buying gpus really differentiate pc within marketplace . oem want sell entry-level notebook n't make money . want upsell . one key cell gpu . david wong chris eveden david wong chris evedenwhole market lot pressure right typically , average consumer general-purpose pc , task , better tablet . something jen-hsun 's saying couple year . 's seeing lot cannibalization . 's lot price pressure market well . 's competition feature might used laptop manufacturer differentiate product . thing like ssd 's touchscreen . expensive add-on might put pressure bottom . market see decline . 's offset actually strength gaming . oem market characterized large number unit low asp low gross margin well . low gross margin percentage . come proper contribution 's much smaller gaming business . jeff fisher talked analyst day last week . actually -- see big swing occasionally unit number n't reﬂected hardly revenue . profit . 's 've got base low value high-volume notebook oem part n't generating much profit . overall , think geforce business strong least ﬂat year year . within , look like mix going get richer . excellent . pushing bit . gaming oems . said gaming 's primarily profit . think revenue -- ? two-thirds , one-third ; gaming earlier . yes . okay great . 've begun give u number . could perhaps step give u view growth potential ? talked bit geforce . professional graphic , tesla , tegra ? right . professional -- let stop take really high level 'll step one . high level , see geforce quadro -- growing slowly , single-digit gdp . generating awful lot cash . 's cash returning quite lot cash shareholder moment . tesla proven growth story . 's smaller base . 's profitable 's growing strongly . grid option growth like . 's lot excitement around grid . 's early day . enterprise . 's two-year purchase cycle . 's really hard u say -- give -- n't got enough dot graph draw line right . 's certainly , promising many way . tegra , put take tegra . automotive business strong , growing strongly . withdrawn mainstream smartphone business . still high-end smartphone tablet well . 'll see unfolds year . 's look high level . taking business bit detail within geforce , quadro - - quadro 82 % market share according idc . 's unit think wallet share 90 % north 90 % dollar share . really , grow business grow market bunch initiative place . suspect dominant term equation going forward , least coming year , likely gdp . specifically , manufacturing gdp , since 80 % sale generated cad sale cad workstation . quadro gtp-plus . tesla , proven growth story . grew 37 % last year . 's really broken . stable $ 100 million year . -- 've broken 've added support code 've got broader channel . let 's give example illustrate mean . 1.5 year ago , sell tesla something , team nvidia -- nvidia team would go company , evangelize tesla particular application . would port code guy application . would sell hardware . , hypothetical example -- research johnson & johnson , looking protein modeling interaction large molecule . know molecular dynamic code accelerated tesla . know ibm sell tesla server . phone ibm salesman get one delivered friday . 's completely different . . 1.5 year ago knew customer . many , many customer n't know . course that's way business scale . ibm -- used ibm randomly . particularly important partner 32 % , according idc , worldwide installed base supercomputer , twice much anybody else . build supercomputer system anybody else . important partner supermicro , huge space ; nec , cray , dell , hp , pretty much 's high-performance data center . computer data center working tesla supplying tesla product . , support code right across molecular dynamic code , seismic code , financial code modeling black-scholes equation . modeling derivative pricing actually something port , well hardware . 's sort application area . 's growing really fast . tesla . next one grid . grid described option growth . grid -- grid -- let differentiate one always cause confusion . tesla computer . although using gpu , 're using graphic . using perform calculation . good example black-scholes . black-scholes nothing graphic . pricing derivative modeling plasma something like . yes -- , nothing graphic . grid data center well . grid graphic . grid serving graphic power remotely 's bunch way monetize . way looking 're excited short term making virtual desktop environment better . 're familiar citrix vmware , make user experience better . make user experience better extend application 3-d application well . right , install virtual desktop environment , generally speaking , using old-style user interface , window 95 type appearance . change . bring window 8. support video support 3-d. say support 3-d , 'm talking high-end quadro type application like kfir . even thing like autodesk , , light 3-d application . light fact 7 million installed seat worldwide , majority intel-integrated . they're even using 3-d graphic card . 's still much 3-d virtual desktop infrastructure . putting card , support 3-d application want . make detailed nature , like . high-level business perspective hundred trial running worldwide . david wong chris eveden david wong chris evedenit 's two-year product cycle ; bit early say exactly 's growing . there's lot excitement around . literally think last time came 466 trial enterprise worldwide . lot lot potential business . tegra . tegra final one n't talked . tegra number market . one 's predictable automotive . 's -- grew strongly last year . expect grow strongly year . going top , expect tablet win , set-top box win , possibly high-end smartphone win well generating revenue year . actually , look current revenue , let 's say recent quarter expected year , look tegra , roughly break segment ? n't broken detail . think roughly , think number said publicly roughly 40 % revenue automotive last year . automotive actually becoming one biggest subsegments tech growth . already one big ( multiple speaker ) . 's market visual computing important actually increasing importance . look advanced driver automation system , strong differentiator . even 're looking infotainment , traditional market we've successful , automotive , quality pixel really starting matter . really affect perception quality car . know , around example life ; barcelona mobile world congress february cab priuses digital dashboard ; needle dial , pixel . recently luckily lucky enough drive friend 's tesla car digital dashboard well . wholly different experience , right ? tesla one clearly dashboard inside $ 100,000 car prius one n't . really brought home -- quality pixel impinges -- affect ability -- impression quality car . david wong chris evedenanother example looking car couple year ago great car , nice engine , beautiful leather seat , great stereo , sportive , handled really well everything . could n't get fact nav system clearly badly translated japanese . tainted whole experience car . , really believe experience bring graphically car going say much quality car hand-stitched leather inlaid walnut used say . 's differentiated placed heavily strength . great . mean , thinking various segment . different application , somewhat different product , talk different competitor ? got one session gpu , different one tesla . let 's go list . geforce quadro , competitor amd . 2/3 market share geforce , said , 4/5 share quadro . ? think best chip . also think term ecosystem driver feature built around chip , really help u hold onto market make stickier otherwise would , give better user experience . really come quality user experience . ecosystem software build huge part . specifically , couple example . one geforce . driver generally considered much better quality amd 's driver . driver layer software sits fit hardware operating system . huge impact performance . life graphic card , continually update driver , thing huge impact . also , 's question putting feature game work geforce card . game better gaming experience geforce . physx example physic simulation run gpus . 's built unreal engine 4. 's built many game . 's going appear titanfall , biggest game moment right . 're going see feature based improves immersiveness whole gaming experience . 's differentiate software . quadro -- 's performance well . 's also stability reliability . enormous amount qualification enormous list professional application across improbably large list system configuration . 's -- director want waste time supporting product . need level qualification give . actually competitor , run list , n't ? 's competition . amd made lot noise competition market actually . geforce , know 's possibility gain share sort low-end transactional oem business . might impact number unit . might see market share number . much impact actually revenue much profit , much smaller number , . think continue growing share gaming , think 'll increase revenue profit share , regardless happens unit . workstation business , quadro , market 's driven price . 's market 's driven quality 's driven performance , dependability stability . think typical cad workstation 's $ 10,000 -- $ 5000 $ 10,000 workstation . $ 20,000 worth software . got however much engineer cost say $ 200,000 year whatever $ 400,000 year , whatever number . 're selling competitor $ 4000 graphic card $ 3000 , matter . n't help , n't get anywhere . need better product . 'm really concerned market , either . go list -- grid ; sorry , tesla -- competitor tesla well , 's two competitor intel . entered market , alternative . wanted high-performance parallel computing , currently running enormous number cpu answer give . since , intel launched xeon 5. first launched xeon 5 , launched graphic card . always said 116 graphic card . might branded tesla competitor point 's exactly happened . larrabee dead . long live xeon 5. 's technology . , expected . 's actually helped u perverse way competitor , traditional xeon cpu . , challenge always overcome inertia . would go potential customer would say hey , look great thing power processing -- much performance per watt , much raw performance , better deal . would reject david wongand say well wait next year , intel going come much better cpu everything going get better automatically right ? would n't anything . wo n't code reporting 've warned . everything get faster automatically . intel market well , intel essentially saying thing u , 're going move parallel point want get performance per watt . running performance per watt gain xeon . moved xeon 5. point , 's question get intel go nvidia ? nvidia got far code ported already . nvidia 's got massive cuda ( rico ) system . 's training 20,000 people year program hardware . intel n't got code ported yet . make claim code run automatically xeon 5 , 's true loyalty sense , like . code reported xeon 5 , ordinary cpu code ported xeon 5 run xeon 5. run slowly ran cpu . 's actually worse . yes , answer question run yes . answer question anyone actually . programming model xeon 5 actually , similar programming model tesla product . 's basically see extension essentially . compile directly help compile figure bit going parallelized bit n't . 're incumbent . intel lot money throw problem 'll certainly win deal . would still anticipate -- 's big market would anticipate tesla continuing grow strongly market . competitor -- , tegra competitor really qualcomm . automotive , incumbent freescale ti . -- n't know capable going moving next generation infotainment certainly hate ask . qualcomm started space . 's got lot term making lost ground term software tool ecosystem built around chip . truly resource 're going compete strongly . , visual computing expertise strong differentiator , strong differentiator already . move next generation advanced driver automation system , ada , 'll even stronger differentiation 're people anything like sort image processing right . - chris eveden q - david wong - chris eveden q - unidentified participant - chris eveden q - david wong - chris evedendo question audience ? anybody ? question answer went minute , n't question . 's u . anyone ? well 're going think question . could talk . chris , , guess , assumption manufacturing technology availability future ? also , plan move finfets ? bit careful say future manufacturing plan , 's competitively sensitive information . moore's law -- jen-hsun talked last week . said moore 's law slowing slowed . find way innovate . innovation like nvlink , think , specific one talking -- fast interconnect cpu gpus well , cpu/gpu gpu/gpu . 's one example innovation . move -- move 20. 'll move 16. whether 'll go hard fast typically gone new node open question . 'll see unfolds . amplify . favorite topic , gentleman asked last week attitude intel past . run nvidia saying know -- ? ( ) . look . mean right tsmc best . best technology . best commercial term they've fantastic , fantastic partner u many , many year . 've used supplier past badly burned . n't mean say completely blind idea actually one supplier q - david wong q - unidentified participant - chris eveden q - david wong - chris evedenmight seem risk . n't need mba wonder aloud . look vendor . would absolutely open looking intel samsung global foundry . look quite closely one ever technology lead right commercial term , would , seriously consider taking least production . think today tsmc best . ca n't imagine relationship tsmc anything stronger today yesterday , thanks announcement amd . certainly got -- 's surely enough strengthen relationship tsmc . question ? anyone else ? relative success automotive tegra versus smartphones smaller display size , -- ? size display n't value much ? thing , power management thing ? certainly bigger screen , pixel driving sophisticated application 're driving screen , fall bailiwick , like . think also mainstream smartphone market cost-driven high level integration market quite important . 's , strong incumbent market qualcomm . motive . connectivity integrate . make diﬃcult market anyone else break . differentiating factor primarily price , 's going diﬃcult place u compete . differentiating factor visual experience , note , car even high-end smartphones tablet , think much better prospect market . answer question ? cool . anyone else ? wondering comment smartphones . 've exited mainstream smartphones . leave baseband capability ? still need baseband , automotive . connectivity going become increasingly important market . 'll keep developing q - david wong - chris eveden q - david wong q - unidentified participant - chris evedenstandalone baseband voice data . 're going develop integrated baseband application processor . okay . 's product 's got one target market mind mainstream smartphones . taker ? chris , see best embedded opportunity available tegra going forward ? well automotive obvious one . 's predictable one paid . said -- pipeline , like , $ 2 billion worth business next year . 've got visibility . sat hand n't make new business call , five year time ' whatever number , 'm saying five year specifically , would $ 2 billion worth revenue . clearly , sitting hand . 're clearly trying go sell company . 's great , predictable , significant revenue line . embedded application looking , suppose 'd count set-top box embedded application . like apple tv , think device like , could add decent gaming well , run android put decent game , think would compelling device , could sell similar price 'd huge differentiation . moving head around much mic ? finished ? right . okay . 'm talking . sorry , 'll finish question 's interesting example . 've got shield , right , nvidia 've got portal running valve game . 's game absolutely loved pc came year ago 's running perfectly well shield . available publicly soon . playing last night , put console 've got high-end -- 've got real gaming console experience , , $ 100 maybe $ 130 . q - david wong - chris eveden q - david wong - chris eveden q - david wong - chris evedennow 've got high-end gaming console . extraordinary , right ? completely change game . playing playing back tv , blu-ray player . right ? mean 'm sure much extra value get . add gaming capability suddenly becomes quite interesting device . 's open , 's android , access whole android ecosystem . 've got portal running shield . 've got angry bird running shield . 've got facebook app running shield . 've got factset running shield . ( multiple speaker ) factset running shield ? 've got factset , 's android app . 've got running shield , yes . maybe need shield . come analyst day . giving away free . already talked , i. oh well . think webcast time anyway . appreciate stopping , chris . 's always great catch nvidia . thank much . sure , thanks david . anyone question , 'm going little longer . reach talk . cool . thank .
