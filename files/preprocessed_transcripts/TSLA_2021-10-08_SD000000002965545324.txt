welcome elon musk . welcome annual shareholder meeting . coming live austin , texas . 've fantastic year . thanks great work tesla team . 'd like start thanking tesla team incredible work past year get . well done . record vehicle delivery , 've already reported . see 's pretty -- mean think might fastest large manufactured object grown . like -- yes . certainly , one fastest , perhaps fastest . look like good chance maintaining future , really dependent supplier challenge . -- basically , get chip , . hopefully , chip shortage alleviate soon , feel confident able maintain something like , least 50 % quite . model 3 became best-selling premium vehicle globally . premium vehicle -- got arrested one point claiming 'd 5,000 week , literally . anyway great . think model best selling vehicle kind globally . think exceed model 3. think 've got good chance best-selling vehicle revenue next year think quite likely best- selling vehicle -- kind , numerically 2023. basically , need olsen get online berlin get online reach volume production , think 's going happen . cash -- term free cash ﬂow generation , obviously tough year back . think 're looking little dicey say least 2017 2018. want go back . got thing looking really good . think 'll see continued strong cash ﬂow generation . especially multiply unit volume time autonomy , increased eﬃciency factory -- think time , 'll see manufacturer make electric vehicle . eventually , manufacturer make autonomous vehicle . think tesla 's open licensing autonomy think autonomy significant lifesaver preventive injury technology . think morally right license manufacturer would like use . ... course made lot progress cost reduction . despite average selling price actually going significantly introduction model 3 model , much lower priced car , 've managed still decently well gross margin . getting average price gross margin diﬃcult , 've managed . yes , 's good . goal really make car affordable possible . seeing significant cost pressure supply chain . 've increase vehicle price , least temporarily , hope actually reduce price time make affordable . yes , unfortunately , expedite -- mean sheer amount money we're spending ﬂying part around world great , hopefully temporary . - - need lot battery . hence , battery day shirt mean . -- going need lot battery . going combination battery supplier . supplier discussion , supplier asked outright , going put business something ? 'm like , . many cell want make supply u affordable price , buy . limit . 're like , oh , okay . like want -- yes , increase 100 % . sound good . basic plan 're really going order lot -- mean ordered lot battery supplier , basically telling supplier literally go much make , 'll take . 'll prioritize battery vehicle , use excess cell powerwall megapack time , think demand stationary storage going least high demand vehicle . sustainable energy , primarily solar wind , intermittent . wind blow time , sun n't shine time , obviously . need battery buffer power . fundamental pillar sustainable energy future basically solar wind . primary stationary battery electric transport . 3 , sustainable energy future long sun shining . people ask fusion , like idea . way think 's totally doable . 's giant fusion reactor sky show every morning zero maintenance . 'm like -- sound like good deal . i'll always catch little bit sunlight power earth . shockingly small amount land needed power earth . 's like couple hundred mile couple hundred mile solar panel power entire united state . 's like , okay 's hard . believe calculated needed one square mile battery . think like , wow , lot battery . one square mile battery . 's crazy . 've got plan reduce cost per kilowatt hour battery . supplier similar plan . really supplemental supplier . 'll make cell , make cell , 'll use . fundamental good tesla , think many year accelerate sustainable energy . fundamental , think way think value tesla . able accelerate sustainable energy year , good . hence , need grow quickly . 've got three new factory . giga shanghai done incredible job . giga shanghai exceeds fremont production . actually , 'd like give special hand tesla china team . 's best quality , lowest cost also low drama . 's great . -- said , continuing expand fremont operation expect hopefully increase fremont output 50 % . -- 's still make old model x made fremont . kind make sense , especially high-volume vehicle production 's least continent consumer . otherwise , -- 's also good environment shipping car several thousand mile . basic idea high-volume vehicle customer approximately least . also great progress building giga texas , right giga berlin brandenburg . hand team well . factory cell production well . really kind raw material , car . really , really big . yes . mean thing like unit pentagon basically . let 's see . impact report . 's lot , think interesting stuff impact report . go quite lot detail thing 're . tesla certainly company 's -- try hard right thing respect . try hard right thing respect . always succeed . 're looking company say company really trying right thing ? tesla . okay . really tried . okay . mean 's -- anyway . mentioning , 've got three part sustainable energy future , solar wind . think primarily solar main source energy sustainable energy -- energy general . need store energy stationary battery pack need electric vehicle electric airplane boat whatnot . yes , great . yes . average life cycle emission u.s. , going get better - - move sustainable grid electric vehicle , obviously move fully sustainable energy economy , want get quickly possible . sooner , better . carbon tax ? mean hell ? people say like , oh , comment would benefit tesla . 'm like , yes , would hurt spacex . carbon tax , really needed . see battery material definitely cyclable , burning gas . co2 extremely stable molecule . mar ' atmosphere primarily co2 billion year . 's extremely stable . soon people worry methane , worry much methane . methane quickly break co2 . methane stable molecule , co2 extremely stable . -- course recycle battery material . think battery essentially high-grade ore. either get lithium nickel various constituent battery rock battery . much better get battery . battery basically high-grade ore. tesla already started recycling lot company going basically pay recycling battery . 're seeing increased extreme weather event . 's like wildfire . austin , massive snowstorm turned power . actually austin snowstorm house electric , light , power , heating , internet . could n't actually even get food store . could get food store , food . went several day . however solar plus powerwall , car would light electricity actually , 've starlink internet , 'd internet . thing need prepper basically . doom's day come , could helpful . factory safety , 've done -- made huge improvement factory safety . 're 18 % better industry average . great . 's always tough safety ramp production line start battery . - elon muskbut 's steady state , injury naturally decline people get used iron issue . 're seeing excellent battery safety tesla . goal saving factory earth . ai day think important change fundamental perception tesla people -- sort think tesla car company , yes , made car , ai part tesla well understood . tesla much software company hardware company . also chip . designed full self-driving inference computer . 're designing training computer 's going able , think eﬃcient neural net training computer world far . 're seeing tremendous response . daily applicant role . see , 's basically y-axis . ai day 's ai applicant increased dramatically . thought successful day . team great job . yes , 's going important part future . self-driving obviously one function . obviously mixed thought ai , 're going watch ai danger . 's happening either way . guess , try best make sure positive . good ai , hopefully . yes . 'm excited announce 're moving headquarters austin , texas . clear , though , continuing expand activity california . matter sort tesla leaving california . said , intention actually increase output fremont giga nevada 50 % . -- 're hitting side bowl . mean -- go fremont factory , jammed . mean jammed . 's like whoa . first went , like -- 're like kid parent 's shoe . ridiculous , like tiny -- giant factory 're like , -- ca n't , like put stuff ? 's tough people afford house lot people come far away . 's -- 'll take -- taken far possible , 's -- 's limit big scale bay area . austin , factory 's like five minute airport , 15 minute downtown . 're going create ecological paradise -- colorado river , 's going great . emphasize gain continuing expand california significantly , even texas . , go question . question answer okay cybertruck production begin ? rate ramp-up happen ? well year constant struggle part supply . clear , like five extra product , would change vehicle output basically limited multiple supply chain shortage , like many time , chip . lot supply chain shortage . -- really would n't matter like semi-auto cybertruck anything , would able make . semi particular need lot cell . need lot cell , lot chip . -- 've got enough otherwise , pointless . think likely 'll see cybertruck stock production next year reach volume production 2023. hopefully , also producing semi new roadster '23 well . severe supply chain shortage '23 . i'm optimistic , case . 'll see . stock split ? well maybe yet . maybe 'll consider stock split point future . think 'll quite quite yet . see 4680 battery cell production texas ? n't think see 4680 production texas year . making 4680s california -- pilot plant , big plant normal standard . 's like capable 10 gigawatt hour year . 's mile away vehicle factory fremont . 's -- basically -- factory able make enough cell giga texas scale production model y. want emphasize like point factory able start making car reach high-volume production typically year . 's considered fast . 's -- take longer -- least tesla land , take longer build factory reach volume production factory built . like shanghai , built factory 11 month , get high-volume production took year . expect something similar . 'll start production year , 'll deliver -- comfortably deliver car giga texas year model y . wo n't reach high-volume production probably end next year . -- also expect 'll reach high level production , 4680 cell giga texas next year well . factory . man , 's hard build factory . 've said many time prototype easy . production hard . like -- whatever 's like 1 % inspiration , 99 % perspiration . think production , 's like 99 % perspiration . think -- mean might start scouting location next year , think lot berlin austin , expanding china , -- expanding fremont . nice thing like least factory europe factory china , factory north america . 'll least factory high-volume product -- continent customer . great . -- like one biggest challenge q3 get enough chip like huge chip shortage . challenge . got stuck panama -- mean suez canal , course -- thing n't expect thing , happen . n't know , we'll probably get new factory location , start investigate next year . maybe make decision '23 . tesla plan offer dividend ? currently plan dividend . kind feel like time company offer dividend 's kind cresting hill , . 's -- usually -- 've run thing invest internally . run thing invest internally long shot . , provide quarterly update energy along automotive ? yes . mean need make progress energy . -- yes , year limited , like said , chip shortage -- chip go stationary battery pack car , prioritize car . -- need inverter solar kind thing . year good guide progress energy . think next year , probably good guide , start providing update think people would interpret correctly opposed explain either short car energy pick car . . right . yes , model 2 car . 's model 2. 3 mean e. 're -- model 3 , try get -- 're going call model e , ford run sue . said , let 's call model 3. 's , 3 , x , instead know . anyway . gigafactory getting bigger iteration . gigafactories get bigger iteration , think . yes , get advanced , eﬃcient . looking sort taking first principle approach manufacturing , want look volumetric eﬃciency factory average speed factory kind like rocket equation , delta v like exhaust velocity time log start end mass ratio . think 's something similar factory . also think like chip , like make chip -- get chip making bigger bringing thing closer together increasing clock speed ? actually , think 's tremendous opportunity factory actually bring thing closer together increase cycle time clock speed . 's actually , think tremendous opportunity improve eﬃciency factory . tesla 's long-term competitive advantage manufacturing cause electric . eventually car autonomous . thing 's hardest , think sort match tesla copy manufacturing . think long-term advantage tesla . yes , limiting factor growth engineering . yes , 's really like factory stamping amazing engineer . 's hard -- 've got basically recruit people . 've got train right way take time . -- like sometimes company think hire anyone engineering degree , slap together get amazing stuff . case . often adding engineer program make go slower . -- excellence engineer matter tremendously . huge difference engineering talent -- boggles mind . wonder today like nikola tesla applied tesla , would even give interview ? 'm sure would . 's like , obviously . concern like , think could better job vetting resume . really , 're looking evidence exceptional ability . like whether somebody graduated particular school whatever . like three bullet point , evidence exceptional ability . say wow , read three bullet point , great . approach . okay . 'm actually big fan original vw sort bus . really cool . really seen new one . yes , mean think time , tesla make basically major variant vehicle , ? one every significant category , think . yes . right . guess people see slide , right ? 'll -- n't need read question . yes . think 're actually making rapid progress solar roof . lar general energy general , got kind short-changed couple year 're desperately trying make model 3 reach volume production . moved everyone anywhere company could possibly work model 3 , working model 3. hand deck , know . 's couple year -- got save -- model 3 fails , whole company dead , could move everyone solar every help model 3. 're couple year behind . think 're making rapid progress solar roof , particular , new homebuilder . obviously eﬃcient way get solar roof put -- put roof instead like -- retrofit obviously fundamentally expensive solar roof new home . relationship number new homebuilder . expect -- gather significant momentum . 're going campaign , kind like , well , updating , want mtv . want solar . ? think actively asking new home development , well , solar roof powerwall generate power help stabilize rest grid . 're using powerwall . 're partnership utility . like thing think people need appreciate 's lot electricity production need occur move electric vehicle future . two home car electric , power electricity usage approximately double . n't local power production home battery battery got buffer power . otherwise , solar without battery , cause massive wave grid . battery stabilize grid . battery act collectively stabilize whole grid . that's software 've developed -- think 're first going go houston , australia , 's going , think quite compelling . really need sustainable energy future , address electricity homeowner level . essential . still prosperous future utility electric power approximately double . transition heating electric well , approximately triple . lot work local level electricity distribution utility . utility better expand 's got solar battery homeowner level . tesla solar battery mean power , matter . utility shuts reason , still power . austin blizzard , 's like staying friend 's house , n't solar roof battery . 'm sitting dark cold . like , okay really brings home need solar roof battery . anyway think 's going see -- think solar roof see massive growth year come . 10.2 ( inaudible ) yes . much inside baseball fsd . -- 're going start rolling fsd beta customer perfect safety driven record tomorrow night midnight , california time . 'll see go . want cautious rollout . q - unidentified participant - elon muskif 's looking good , 'll -- 's like little 1,000 people perfect score . 'll start giving people 99 , 98 , 97 forth . 'll probably cutoff . 's like 60 % . n't know . 's got willing people extremely conscientious driver beta program . -- 's looking really good . actually drove friend 's house 'm staying austin , quite far away quite complicated drive , car took way friend 's house gigafactory intervention . perfect drive . yes . right . -- question ? guess 'll take -- yes , audience ? sure . yell whatever n't ... ( inaudible ) . need mining battery ? basically , 've got extend ﬂeet . ﬂeet car gigantic . 's 2 billion car truck use world . 's lot . annual global capacity vehicle $ 100 million year roughly , kind make sense . like car truck tend last 20 year go junkyard . 's important important statistic bear mind , like even car -- vehicle electric tomorrow , still take 20 year change ﬂeet . think people n't -- like see lot noise sort story electric vehicle . ﬂeet matter . -- basically round nothing . look total ﬂeet vehicle earth electric car point , think still well 1 % ﬂeet . -- n't know , probably 30 years-ish , 30 , 40 year . yes , 's bad . yes . yes . think clarify thing sometimes misunderstood . lithium extremely plentiful . one plentiful thing earth . rare . 's hard avoid lithium . said , dig bunch rock n't lithium ? would hard time . 's seawater . 's -- basically lithium salt . salt ? 's little bit salt pretty much everywhere . 's lithium everywhere . 's issue . also lithium like maybe 1 % 2 % cell . actual thing matter cathode . -- well , actually , higher -- long-range vehicle use nickel-based cathode , people think 's cobalt-based cathode . q - unidentified participant - elon musk q - unidentified participant - elon musk q - unidentified participant - elon musk q - unidentified participantno cobalt used phone laptop , use nickel nickel higher energy density long-range vehicle . standard range vehicle stationary storage , think move iron-based -- iron cathode . iron also extremely plentiful . nickel rare , 's -- 10 100x iron nickel . moving iron-based chemistry , sort finally point competitive range combined eﬃcient powertrain , think vast majority battery future iron based . see shortage . 's question making equipment kind process cell pack . ( inaudible ) off-planet factory . off-planet factory . like way think . 're many year tesla 's first off-planet factory . mean 'd like see one 'm dead . would cool . n't know got like 40 years-ish . hopefully , 'm dead , basically . would great . ( inaudible ) . 's safety score ? oh great question . n't know actually . yes . n't know . 'll check . 'll check -- think 's -- mine get turned . yes . 'll pick one . way safety score calculation obviously imperfect . 's try emphasize much beta , alpha safety score calculation . 's going get lot change -- yes , expect improve accuracy substantially time . really -- 's early stage algorithm . ( inaudible ) . anything grid system ? yes . fact , tesla number project tesla -- texas . tesla , texas . -- 've got large battery project , believe houston area . yes , houston area . ( inaudible ) 100 megawatt ? - elon musk q - unidentified participant - elon musk q - unidentified participant - elon musk q - unidentified participant - elon musk q - unidentified participant sorry ? 100 megawatt ? yes . 100 megawatt houston area . 're talking ercot major installation . tesla megapack system actually really great dealing power ﬂuctuations . look power usage , varies dramatically day . get particularly summer day winter day 've got electric heating electric cooling , 're going see big spike hotter cold day . -- even day see big variance . -- like order power -- power grid sort energy storage buffer , 's resilient worst second worst day worst year . 's -- 's obviously great . sort -- 'll throw peaker plant , peaker plant reliant natural gas , people start using natural gas heating , kind happened houston , people using gas heat peaker plant gas . like , okay battery would work great . there've tesla megapacks -- waste power would gone . target capacity megapack factory ? target capacity megapack factory ? . n't actually know target capacity , 's big . 40 gigawatt hour . okay 40 gigawatt hour . yes . actually , 's example expanding -- also 're expanding manufacturing california . -- -- california , opened big mega pack production facility . ( inaudible ) . - elon musk q - unidentified participant - elon musk q - unidentified participant - elon musk sorry ( inaudible ) . ( inaudible ) . tesla insurance . yes . -- like degree insurance regulatory labyrinth insane . like designed hard feeling guy . n't know 's -- certainly diﬃcult . 's zillion application , wait bunch time . get 's come long complicated lot state state . state state . 're processing application state across country . state also different regulation . ca n't actually -- n't legally allowed offer insurance every state . 've got adjust software different every state . 's basically complicated . think we'll offering texas soon . like maybe month something . next week . great . phoned friend . yes , tesla insurance go live texas next week . knew month , - - california . 're going upgrading version california -- want kind real-time insurance -- insurance cost based driving history , like right way . 're currently allowed california reason . we're trying get permission regulator allowed give accurate score like 's thing 'd want . hopefully , n't know , probably country next year aspirationally , 's goal . ( inaudible ) . 'm really getting weed . 're definitely going making cybertruck . probably atv , . atv interesting design challenge atvs pretty dangerous . want make atv least dangerous atv . 're going atv , well , miss least dangerous atv . 'll really low center gravity battery pack low think thing suspension . make really hard roll thing . -- atvs roll bad thing happen . q - unidentified participant - elon muskgoing atv wo n't roll . would cool . got one cybertruck . okay . 'll take one last question . yes ?
