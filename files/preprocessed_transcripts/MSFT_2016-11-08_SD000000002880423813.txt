welcome , everyone . , n't know , name mark moerdler . cover global software bernstein . 's distinct pleasure welcome takeshi numoto , corporate vp cloud enterprise . takeshi microsoft since 1997 brings today 's discussion deep knowledge microsoft 's commercial product commercial cloud solution . since n't jacket , 'll take mine roll sleeve . hold -- ( inaudible ) 's okay , want relaxed . 'll lay lot interesting question . 'm going start , would call , speed dating question , blast question , get quick answer question investor asked u high level , give ( inaudible ) . 'd like start high level make microsoft 's cloud platform , product . talk externally microsoft cloud cloud run rate revenue metric , example , 're talking commercial cloud service offering . includes thing like azure . 's inclusive underlying offer , like em power bi , well oﬃce 365 dynamic 365. excellent . high level , many datacenter region worldwide ? takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler well 's really customer demand driven , sense customer need , term environment look , , complex . whether regulatory requirement like data residency ability really datacenters close wherever want deploy application solution , 's kind look term giving customer option able deploy solution application closer either employee market 're trying address . big datacenter region datacenter ? comparable microsoft amazon google might build ? one thing first want clarify , talk 38 region azure , something may heard , region datacenter . region essentially logical representation one datacenters . typically set -- region represented huge datacenters , one large datacenter region . case , typically , 're aggregating multiple datacenter location . they're within network latency proximity , logically represent one logical datacenter . call region . 38 announced world . 's basically competition offer wide margin . , like said , reason offer really geared towards enterprise need . think one key reason enterprise customer look u ability deploy application solution closer need application solution deployed . 're also unique sense offer -- essentially , 're global provider legally licensed operate cloud service offer china . offer partner called 21vianet . also unique -- essentially data trustee model germany , datacenter offering germany , data controlled , term access data , controlled partner microsoft directly . give , particularly customer germany europe , additional isolation term data sovereignty . great . thank . big datacenter footprint ? mean , could say built support 10 % world 's compute -- mean , 's fair metric takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdleryou 've built date ? share bunch collateral term sheer scale datacenters . quite impressive . sometimes people talk cloud , lot people immersed kind thing like server room . think , well , cloud , . sheer scale datacenters . let alone sheer scale region aggregate multiple datacenters , quite staggering . could sort show sort video reel [ ph ] talk amount concrete used one datacenter , number cabling 's used one datacenter exceed -- essentially circumvent , encircle earth multiple time thing like . scale quite impressive . sense term -- built capture big portion world capacity ? think question implies cloud largely sort mere shift trend [ ph ] . u -- sort customer adoption pattern bear -- cloud , course , place shift workload . many time , cloud also place new thing n't . want advanced analytics , want learn machine -- machine learning ( inaudible ) want apply data , may activity done on-prem . 're surely thinking building datacenter capacity percentage world 's computing capacity even on-prem capacity ; 're really basis customer demand . basically scaling meet need customer demand . consumption growth azure substantial . q1 , think talked compute , azure compute growth doubling year year . overall consumption growth around 120 % year year . we're basically looking -- 're seeing customer interest consumption growth across world . keep capacity . n't think ratio talked . okay . 's fair . little detail -- azure adoption cycle ? still early adopter , guy kicking tire ? enterprise running large production enterprise workload ? think ? takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto would say 's -- 's certainly , quote-unquote , early adopter . would say , best -- one way think almost like early inning , play baseball . okay . everybody 's playing game . everybody 's game , varying degree . customer starting sort tiptoe water , maybe saas application like oﬃce 365 , azure , maybe something like disaster recovery . , customer far deeper term really deploying mission-critical application , like sap running azure . question essentially -- answer question participation cloud really taking across customer base . degree . sophistication , still high variable . level participation cloud , think , broadened dramatically last year . okay . expect continue , obviously ? yes . good , excellent . microsoft 's cloud value proposition customer versus sort enterprise software vendor , workday vendor ? future , see customer using multiple cloud , like azure aws compute . oracle workday apps ? think world moving next number year ? journey see customer going -- entry point journey cloud could different depending customer . customer may start mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdlerby introducing saas application environment , whether oﬃce 365 dynamic 365. may one part journey . might start infrastructure first . may start something like storage disaster recovery . might actually start using cloud term developing net new application -- 's sort hard conceive deploy on-prem . particularly around thing like new data ai type application . whether start saas first infrastructure first , net new application cloud first , see customer evolving end needing three . might actually start one three different scenario . time , customer essentially need , whether 's saas thing [ ph ] thing net new application development platform . see customer number . q1 , example , talked fortune 500 company , 90 % -plus fortune 500 customer running business microsoft cloud . 60 % running three microsoft cloud offering , basically 20-point improvement year year . kind go show u , customer may start one different entry point . actually evolving use . compared application-centric vendor , really [ ph ] approach 're far comprehensive . 's see even partner like sap basically bring application run azure . 've made announcement week ago . application know enterprise stand alone . 're never silo , integrated different application . data need shared across different application , 's huge role horizontal application platform cloud platform like azure play . course , customer want go essentially deploy saas application purely sap workday , actually connector integration point , whether thing like active directory , go integrate . want make sure customer way use azure , whether 's conjunction existing saas app using azure horizontal line business model . okay . brilliant one [ ph ] number . said 60 % customer running -- 90 % fortune 500 running three solution . 's still , , early inning within opportunity build use azure , correct ? yes . first , 60 % n't within 90 % . takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numotookay . 's actually 60 % ( multiple speaker ) base . talk three , sure 's even within three 60 's already using three service . lot consumption growth opportunity , may starting use one three service . use volume service , addition consuming service . 's lot opportunity . excellent . provide sense opportunity azure third-party saas solution vendor building running top azure ? -- gave sap example , big 's going run , think could run azure , going saas member ? 'm quite sure get particularly fixated notion saas . interesting really think opportunity essentially enterprise isv application essentially move take advantage something like azure . given historical relationship many enterprise isvs , opportunity work talk enterprise isv solution take advantage cloud . also move essentially on-prem business model one cloud . example , esri delivers geospatial solution top azure . they're historically on-prem solution . , bring cloud solution cloud . teninose [ ph ] core vacuum [ ph ] solution historically on-prem solution . 're working u ( inaudible ) via cloud . opportunity think whether 's delivered sort multitenant saas application deliver essentially cloud host solution n't necessary saas multitenant . 's huge opportunity u work enterprise isvs bring solution azure help essentially transform business . time , also opportunity work net new isvs net new world developing net new solution . offer sort faster hopefully better chance succeeding marketplace , use azure ingrate enterprise environment . enterprise customer , example , n't necessarily want set another directory authentication scheme new saas vendor , particularly established [ ph ] player . offer help saying -- hey , integrate azure azure ad [ ph ] , example , offer sort unified authentication scheme application enterprise cio csos would like mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdlerto able able manage application . opportunity onboard net new enterprise isv stack [ ph ] well . whether helping transform existing enterprise isvs bring net new enterprise isvs azure , think great opportunity . , course , catalyze consumption azure . following , azure versus cloud platform building datacenter ? well think boil three , four thing 're focused microsoft cloud level . 's initially azure segment . 's sort microsoft cloud segment 're focused . first , talked sort global scale set level region actually -- address data residency need , essentially deploy -- far option competition offer term able deploy solution application closer need , whether market employee partner . 's one advantage . , , much focused really making easy partner customer able trust cloud implementation model . trust huge deal key enterprise design point u . think work around security amount compliance work , far -- compliance certification global cloud vendor , think soc [ ph ] iso even vertical compliance standard like hipaa pci , name . competition . essentially lower barrier customer partner use azure . 's huge differentiation point . thirdly , think , big one really deep notion hybrid . u , hybrid mere notion connecting public cloud on-prem . 's even moving virtual machine on-prem public cloud . 's far complete consistency platform . way application layer , thing like productivity business application , data technology like sql , way identity infrastructure , provide really consistent platform . essentially enables partner customer able much ﬂexible deployment model , focus app . deploy -- think best way deploy . three big differentiation versus others . takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numotoexcellent . define approach almost 're giving client ramp cloud versus rip replace [ ph ] cloud ? certainly , 's part . like said , lot cloud consumption taking place initially lift shift -- right . -- also using net new . also like new scenario combine already on-prem . net new n't mean 's isolation on-prem ; oftentimes share data , share technology already on-prem . using cloud extend . 've focusing much energy ai machine learning , creates new use case ? well u , cloud perspective , consumption almost prime directive . right . want everything drive cloud adoption consumption . could enriching new offering , like delivering new offering use case like ai . would n't like able add speech recognition application , would like -- scenario face detection useful , emotion detection useful application ? offer apis use build apps azure . certainly add new scenario business opportunity n't monetization opportunity apis offer . also broader application consumption brings sure . similarly , 's 're focused essentially expanding tam . speak , cloud offering embracing os solution . think supporting variant linux , including red hat , operating system support broad set os technology , whether 's mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numotodata side , like mysql mungo [ ph ] , 's language framework lot os developer familiar . 're spending lot time making sure sdks php goldman sachs [ ph ] whatnot first-class . bring os developer azure . 's certainly showing customer adoption . think azure vms , quarter vms running azure linux right . right . okay . 're opening opportunity open-source , opening linux , saas guy -- many running linux open-source capability . shrink opportunity window server ? necessarily . think -- might expect , 're fairly rigorous tracking installed base sort share enterprise term percentage server stop running [ ph ] enterprise , window versus linux . 're initially seeing dramatic shift term window business regard . continues pretty healthy . even think on-prem business result q1 , reported double-digit growth premium version server product . part , customer become increasingly sophisticated use cloud [ ph ] , want on-prem technology sort compatible copasetic model . 's driving sort higher addition adoption on-prem server , . n't initially think cloud transition essentially shrinkage window server opportunity . 's really certainly cloud giving u opportunity participate market n't participated linux market . 's 're embracing . following -- feel investor comfortable window business continuing , growing business , given put take everything else ? certainly think lifetime value window server . whether on-prem healthy growing mix annuity . actually thing like azure hybrid use right , 're baking annuity business model , essentially buy window server , actually take license deploy essentially run window server cheaply azure . 're basically , -- 's almost -- think hybrid business model . 's one way make sure -- customer 's journey cloud accretive business overall . mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler excellent . one window -- think much window server use case tied hosting traditional microsoft window workload like exchange sharepoint , et cetera ? look use case , 's vast amount long-tail application deployed window server . first-party application , like sharepoint exchange , certainly important application u . term overall impact installed base window server , mean , say 's dominant . okay . changing gear -- dynamic -- n't really -- investor n't really focused yet dynamic . yet , quarter , really good result dynamic crm online . cloud version seemed growing fast . focus dynamic product ? midmarket , enterprise ? think ? well think 's . historically , might recalling asset originally started dynamic business based acquisition centered around midmarket . right . might cause -- hey , 's kind midmarket-based asset . think business growth , 're seeing really , really strong business growth would call vpe space well . increasingly , dynamic business midmarket business ; 's certainly growing rapidly enterprise well . 've market win , whether 's vhv 's switcher salesforce , -- get customer like american online 's [ ph ] adopting crm . seeing adoption enterprise sure . takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numotoand today 's predominantly dynamic crm ? think long term ? mixed vrp , new product within dynamic family ? well actually , one thing 've recently done -- spend [ ph ] time increasingly -- 've announced new approach biz apps going market unified branding around dynamic 365. 're really break sort vendor-imposed silo exist market today , crm . 's erp . treated completely differently . kind segregation duty separation segmentation largely vendor based , customer really want ability think really -- hey , actually run business best way possible essentially lead way cash ? , 've gone onto market . 's available today market called dynamic 365 , essentially unifies asset 've traditionally used call dynamic crm , well erp asset . basically one unified cloud offering essentially handle process end-to-end . addition , addition unifying sort [ ph ] crm product erp product , 've also done way 's one large monolithic thing buy . want start customer service , want start sale automation , want start field service project service automation , get going essentially scenario like , knowing fully well platform fully integrated . add additional application , business application . actually consume capability . 're done way actually start bite-sized way . think way approach product . even pricing model licensing modeling , quite disruptive marketplace . we'll quite bullish . excellent . fully integrated dynamic 365 ? span oﬃce 365 similar name . azure . product ? dynamic 365 unified biz app offering across sort crm business process way operation finance . product , biz app mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdler takeshi numoto mark moerdlersuite , integrate oﬃce 365. 's lot capability offer get email oﬃce 365 within outlook , 's -- let 's say , customer emailing includes like quote number whatever -- right . -- would recognize essentially prompt quote backend system dynamic 365. 's lot integration across product . dynamic 365 encompass oﬃce 365. basically peer product integrate across . future upsell opportunity ? absolutely . okay . give u sense cross-sell advantage oﬃce 365 , dynamic 365 , azure -- much -- big think sell module upsell , sell suite ? big . sticky opportunity ? well mean , , number quoted , think , sort speak point , seeing customer use multiple cloud offering . right . going 60 % fortune 500 , 20 point increase year year substantial movement . takeshi numoto mark moerdler q - unidentified participant q - mark moerdler - takeshi numotoright . think speak power really thinking microsoft cloud holistically . think get lot question community essentially attempt take kind think narrow comparative view azure versus aws , google versus oﬃce 365 , pretty category-by-category narrow way . real power seeing customer adoption cloud end needing element cloud . 're uniquely positioned able address need holistically opportunity able essentially address need across different cloud need . , we're seeing number , think . excellent . let open couple question audience . keep question short . -- 'll able make sure repeat . 's mic . thank . question answer ( technical diﬃculty ) . question , go methodology , internal thinking term insourcing datacenters versus outsourcing ? well say insource outsource , use -- sound like 're asking kind lease-or-build kind question . whether facility leased , want make sure like actually run datacenter operation . 's like azure datacenters somehow outsourced term operation , whether underlying asset leased built . 's one clarification wanted . , 's really -- hate might like answer . 's really case- by-case basis . sometimes know think ability get market quickly . sometimes lease might faster option . build might take slightly longer , might imagine . think long term , cost build q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numotomight slightly cheaper . like think element . , per-country per-region basis , think best way . none business fixed stone , sense -- , region encompasses multiple datacenters . given region might encompass datacenters two different implementation model , one 's leased one 's built . 's one region represent customer . really , 's implementation detail think case-by-case way . excellent . next question ? good . 's easy . look microsoft cloud vision , look commercial side business , expectation much , fast transformation [ ph ] cloud ? going fast 'd like go ? well guess would always like go faster . right . right ? ask ( inaudible ) hey , azure growth pretty substantial , satisfied , would say -- hey , want . course , say , want . tell want time . ( inaudible ) overall , think quite encouraged growth 're seeing . continuing see triple-digit growth consumption . compute consumption , like said , doubled year year . first time 's ongoing quite . lot work . notion essentially real technology stack bring bear , public cloud also consistent platform customer use on- prem seem resonating . 's really also helping -- cloud approach also helping u address new tam n't participate . overall , think 're quite bullish . excellent . would limiting factor , , continuing grow rate 're growing . within azure business oﬃce 365 business ? q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdlerhmm . maybe n't . well course , always execute better go faster . 's across . azure side , need great job consistently balancing two key growth lever . one acquire new customer . 're basically adding 200 subscription week . 's high run rate either customer acquisition . time , great job customer acquired growing consumption . right . 's make product easier use , engage customer sale resource investment made . actually help accelerate consumption cloud ? thing go continue fully execute . really upon -- market momentum clearly [ ph ] behind u . really upon u seize opportunity . excellent . changing gear sql server -- see biggest direct competitor sql server ? would compare oracle delivers today versus aurora [ ph ] delivers today ? think really disruptive value proposition particularly sql server 2016. think value capability 've added product . whether in-memory capability . advanced analytics right top database , in-memory oltp [ ph ] performance implement made , in-memory bi [ ph ] , capability added would essentially add-on product oracle product realm . right . - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler 've documented roi difference , total cost ownership -- basically 12x cheaper . really bringing differentiated value prop table . folk like gartner really recognizes u sense 're like tippy-top right top corner magic quadrant two year row . right . 're sort bringing increased value proposition table really seeing opportunity growth business , existing base also taking share . excellent . see key differentiator new version sql server could drive adoption ? well total -- tco [ ph ] value difference capability ( inaudible ) talked , think , , big lever . another one 's worth talking . go previous statement around hybrid , really thinking deeply mean deliver hybrid capability . sql 2016 , actually deploy sql 2016 on-prem basically set policy portion table getting drifted [ ph ] stored cloud , application remain unchanged , database would basically provide unified query back data sits across on-prem cloud . right . 's example 're delivering true example , really rich example hybrid use case , premise sale motion really catalyze also dialog around cloud way make sense customer . 's -- sql 2016 n't growth opportunity sql license business per se . 's also great way engage customer cloud . excellent . - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numotooﬃce 365 -- e3 version , e5 version market today . see core thing driving -- going drive people e5 ? end ? future possibility keeping expand market term capability price ? two answer , actually probably three . one , oﬃce 365 e5 motion per se , within sort product dialog , 're seeing tremendous amount customer reaction , particularly around security value proposition . approach security bolt-on product essentially intrinsic securing workload . customer customer want secure oﬃce 365 workload . right . security element oﬃce 365 , particularly thing like advanced threat protection , really resonating . security portion e5 rally [ ph ] proposition , think , going really well . , certainly lot accelerate adoption essentially analytics voice capability , really happy fact way 're participating market -- big market opportunity opportunity grow term advanced analytics bi also voice . e5 vehicle give u lot opportunity . excellent . okay . e5 give opportunity , especially security side . 're heard earlier today another speaker much resonating , security compliance , et cetera . analytics seems part . important voice [ ph ] capability within e5 ? ? 'm sure 'm sort best person talk opportunity voice . , 's huge opportunity horizontal application essentially necessary . 's something small population employee need ; 's something everybody need . right . lot resonance compatibility way general sell cloud . 're generally bullish opportunity . q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler q - unidentified participant q - mark moerdler - takeshi numotoone thing 'll talk term -- relation e5 oﬃce 365 e5 great opportunity . 're also helping company rally around , particularly around notion security creating offering called secure productive enterprise -- right . -- really make easy customer buy essentially product across window , oﬃce . em altogether . right . essentially , upsell opportunity security perspective . making easy customer buy transact u , way , solution essentially protects window device , protects mobile device , protects oﬃce 365 environment across endpoint -- actually something 're bullish . excellent . let see 's another question audience . continue . yes ? ( technical diﬃculty ) question azure stack . customer feedback . customer interest feedback azure stack tremendous . we've seen -- forget exact number . certainly higher expected number term downloads customer trying . we've dropped essentially technical preview , , night week -- month ago . customer feedback interest strategy really delivering hybrid cloud solution , use public cloud service well create environment 's highly compatible offer public cloud on-premises , resonating really well . q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler excellent . let ask little azure , since 's obviously lot question space . azure accelerated quarter , obviously quite bullish opportunity , company building datacenters . driving ? simply fact 're moving little farther inning . 's people driving adoption ? magic going ? think 's sort combination three factor . one seeing quite healthy growth existing customer . right . customer get going azure , month month , year year , consumption customer 've already acquired azure going well . 's big driver consumption growth . another one , course , really focused , addition consumption growth , acquiring new customer . talked 200,000 new subscription . 's sort metric look term 's velocity customer acquisition . need get customer started . right . initial consumption might small . get going quickly possible . grow time . , thirdly , consumption grows , seeing really healthy growth premium service . consumption growth happens customer , use pattern use case become sophisticated . perhaps may originally sort base compute storage network initially . we're seeing good growth thing call azure premium service , like database service advanced analytics service machine learning service . we're seeing , think , nine consecutive quarter term [ ph ] growth premium service . essentially catalyzing consumption growth . - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numotoexcellent . move stack premium version -- thing going continue drive coning improvement premium ? done add capability ? well think 's three thing . one certainly continue invest product make product richer better time . secondarily , 're seeing nice roi sale investment 've made , term really dedicated resource engage deeply customer use cloud deeper sophisticated way . continuing sort drive good return another one . thirdly work 're isv ecosystem , -- tech . solution isvs partner si partner build term practice deliver value end customer ? building ecosystem they're growing [ ph ] accelerate consumption . microsoft 's always partner-centric organization . obviously , initially selling cloud downloading direct . 're selling , guess , lot cloud . see mix ? keep driving ecosystem get bigger better ? 're absolutely right . strong dna company partner- centric . 's really important cloud . particularly think product like azure , 's like end customer wake say want virtual machine , database . 's furtherance solution . solution come form solution customer develops . likely , could iv [ ph ] si partner implementing . notion really cultivating partner ecosystem able better take advantage cloud [ ph ] invest important u . 's part reason 're investing new business model like csp partner program , enables partner essentially deliver finished service end , building top microsoft cloud service , azure also oﬃce 365 dynamic 65. saas vendor n't point taken direct-only model . -- many infrastructure paas vendor taken almost shopping cart -- pick couple thing dropping . -- drill little advantage approach 're taking today long-term payouts microsoft ? q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numotowell two way think . one certainly would like engage saas vendor customer -- right . -- deliver saas , perhaps even unbeknownst customer run azure . 's azure ( inaudible ) need . 's key engagement model u . announced , since partnership adobe example , 're bringing marketing cloud , document cloud , creative cloud -- saas solution -- azure . 's important opportunity u . time , like said , apps , particularly enterprise , live silo . data shared . application integrate system . opportunity u basically provide platform saas application vendor customer use collectively share data . , think , sort best world . excellent . 've obviously -- started purely microsoft-centric offering azure . 've expanded adding third-party open-source database technology . think add , add . whether add simply something available virtual machine versus something 's platform play ? think certainly striving incredibly feedback driven . rather team sit redmond think technology add next , actually lot signal get consumption . see , okay , people stuck consumption ? improve documentation ? improve better [ ph ] sample ? -- many point data able collect . even documentation -- n't know whether know . core documentation github . anybody community , anybody internet , basically sort give u feedback , hey , need thing like , need capability like , need document done . essentially , commented get u open way . team look say -- hey , actually take feedback either improve documentation include way product presented , essentially change capability product ? q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numotoand think 're really feedback driven , given feel like critical mass footprint community . github recently gave u award one biggest contributor code base , also contribute code , . engagement model broader set community really feedback driven , think , way we're going drive . feedback type loop used -- need add zyz's brand linux open-source nosql database -- 's based customer interest ? absolutely . yes . totally . customer interest , 're constantly monitoring make decision . way think -- n't want put word mouth . ask , microsoft think , purely consumption model . therefore whether 're consuming someone else 's 're consuming microsoft 's , something want chase ? yes . think , like said , 've gotten really clear , typically around azure , consumption prime directive . right . , course like software , . love . people use software cloud , 's kind best case . right . time , going basically clear fact 's -- prime directive consumption . particularly many customer , 's like 're really picking two technology . already preferred technology . 're saying -- hey , use azure ? really make sense u basically . sort basically try embrace thing people want , whether 's os q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numototechnology language framework operating system standpoint , database standpoint ; big-tented humanly possible . reason push sql linux ? 's certainly one element . also saw great opportunity add value , frankly . capability sql really , really great . actually deliver set developer write application exploitive in-memory capability advanced analytics capability ? essentially address tam sql -- okay . -- expands tam sql business . , given market expansion purely traditional sql database nosql hadoop database rest , -- think ? think sql opportunity [ ph ] traditional market . variant part market ? think sql moving able support nontraditional , 've added capability respect ? yes . well , certainly working expand relevance product . think lot capability like hadoop , added capability sql 2016 , called polybase , example , allows basically write query across relational database non-relational data source unified way -- right . -- get sort unified result back -- 's another way continue essentially expand aperture sql useful . time , 're also directly embracing lot nosql type technology well . thing like dot tv service cloud . 've basically made api dot tv compatible long wave ci [ ph ] . 're familiar q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numotolong wave tv , actually use dot tv essentially exactly way already familiar using long wave tv , example . across data technology portfolio , broad base technology sql . capability like dot tv . hd insight , essentially managed hadoop service . even advanced technology like azure data lake , highly differentiated sense fully managed service literally put petabyte object . system handle sort charting ( inaudible ) query automatically . broad portfolio , furtherance recruiting application data leveraging azure . given breadth depth 're offering , give sense much traditionally , five 10 year ago , addressable microsoft sold ? guess , many new thing , particularly thing exist azure , probably would addressable previously . net new tam expansion . also , think -- go back -- n't think azure versus aws sense way really -- spent lot time thinking microsoft cloud holistically . example , azure data lake technology originally sort started capability originally built bing , term huge data store 's capable indexing internet . technology originally used first-party bing . right . , market expanded people require level capability . figured way essentially offer commercial service azure . n't work azure team showing azure cross-microsoft team 's capability showing azure . thing like face detection emotion detection similar sense 's essentially way microsoft company surface investment 've made place like microsoft research shine lens azure . 's lot capability offer oﬃce 365 essentially engineered azure engineering team show . 're trying q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdlerreally customer-centered way n't package monetize product based engineering team work , essentially think ﬂexibly -- regardless engineering team work , 's best place show customer , whether 's oﬃce 365 azure . 's we're really sort rallying around microsoft cloud whole way 're running business . cloud reach commercial cloud ; 're feeding bing window live xbox live everything else . cross-pollenating appropriate . yes . course , make commercial offering , go compliance , interpretation ( inaudible ) 's value azure team often commercializing technology . right . wanted give example way think microsoft cloud really manifestation microsoft engineering capacity showing way make sense customer regardless engineering org . okay . 's significantly different saw many year within microsoft . think whole notion customer-centric engineering output customer packaging make sense something 're increasingly getting better . okay . speed market , term going idea something , also improving change development strategy process ? - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler q - unidentified participant q - mark moerdler yes . mean , 've company 19-plus year . yes . time experienced speed delivering new capability . fact , one thing 're constantly working keep partner ecosystem seller field partner trained date level new thing coming ferocious rate . right . could argue 's good problem . something work . want make sure product customer representation product reﬂecting latest greatest . right . okay . guess 's also part value prop , get client going premise running either hybrid cloud pure cloud , lack better word , client going able get much faster , capability , new improvement , et cetera , et cetera . feedback traditional on-prem customer driving acceleration upgrading latest version window server , sql server , et cetera ? well 's certainly intent . 's 're trying execute . excellent . question audience ? yes ? ( technical diﬃculty ) question , fortune 500 company running aws decides move azure , 's cost , 's time ? - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler answer , many aspect , conversation customer initially switching 've already done . 's -- like next workload , may already done . next project -- cloud penetration , cloud consumption happening rate oftentimes , 's far le switching . 's far next opportunity , 's net new . increasingly , customer , particularly may invested heavily aws definitely looking multi-cloud strategy . 're saying -- hey , want make sure 'm single-vendored cloud . want able manage portfolio sits across different cloud . , course , give u opportunity say -- hey , 're next project going azure . perhaps relook one 've done . first -- likelihood success n't focus switch . actually focus next workload . would imply amount greenfield opportunity massive point , compared ability interest taking one cloud vendor another ? right , certainly believe market expansion momentum growth initially come expense . okay . mean 're going see -- n't mean n't competitive situation , n't mean competitive bid . right . 's always procurement expert every company . get earn business sure . also , time , 's initially always switch required u win . right . okay . much switch . q - unidentified participant - takeshi numoto q - mark moerdler - takeshi numotoone last question , think , audience . ( technical diﬃculty ) yes . let explain 've done term essentially simplifying pricing october , really done . may come across price reduction . 's really simplification , sense historically azure pricing somewhat different based contractual ( inaudible ) used buy azure . basically seeing lot growth , particularly customer may traditionally engaged u , may -- we've learned lot actually n't know sort check channel distribution find greatest price . 're maybe startup , may relatively unengaged customer microsoft distribution mechanism . order make sure simplify pricing model , particularly azure . reach new audience price-competitive way . already price-competitive way priced overall . n't visible website . simplified . website price basically reﬂect offer channel . excellent . apologize , 're going cut point . takeshi , thank much , really appreciate time effort . thank . thank much .
