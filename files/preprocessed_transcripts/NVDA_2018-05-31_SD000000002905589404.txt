're able learn recognize different type situation . camera data , radar data , lidar data . complex process . 's iterative process . 's ongoing , 're constantly collecting data testing training algorithm . reality though 's way generate enough data driving ï¬‚eet car around . part problem drive car around , 're seeing everything want able train system . simulation playing big , big role term able train system also able test validate . 'll talk second . finally , drive car , need supercomputer . 've actually brought one . maybe afterwards , people want see , 'll share . drive xavier . , course , automotive grade . 's supercomputer . particular configuration single xavier chip . soc got safety assessment tãƒå “ v sãƒå “ , leading safety expert germany . adheres iso 26262 standard . asil d. highest level safety integration . ready go production . 're working 25 different robo-taxi company part ecosystem well , , major automaker truck maker others alike . mentioned simulation . talk afterwards . essentially , , 's way drive mile capture need , train nomad . also 's dangerous , right ? thing need train child running street car running red light front u , somebody splitting lane cutting u . n't want put real car kind situation training testing . 've developed something call drive constellation . leveraging , , multiple part nvidia together . one server constellation full gpus . we're essentially rendering virtual environment . 're simulating sensor car would see front-facing camera , rear camera , side camera . simulate radar . simulate lidar . build virtual world . essentially , create scene , whole road network . bring map . photo realistically create environment . basically drag drop sensor put car . position , type camera radar , lidar , vehicle , point wherever need point , run simulation . create driving scenario , car driving highway city , q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiroother car merging . 'll see center upper say autosim visual 's generated simulator . output simulator go nvidia drive computer 's also data center . essentially , 're driving virtual world . 're running entire software stack data center test . output simulator go nvidia drive process information driving road . computer n't know 's data center . think 's cruising 101. sends command turn left , turn right , accelerate brake back simulator instead actual steering wheel pedal . virtually drive billion mile safe way recreate kind hazardous condition , bad weather , bad lighting condition , blinding sun , snow , whatever . benefit , course , create robust neural network handle blinding sun . ï¬‚eet self-driving car cruising around , test blinding sun minute day . simulation , 24 hour day . , becomes , valuable tool customer training neural net testing hardware system . finally , think strength built , slide point testament open platform , scalable platform software tool 've built leveraged industry . many partner developing many different project . 's really great build , get chance work see 're able really help push industry forward . point , think 'll pause sort dive whatever question want . question answer okay , perfect . great overview . actually , go nvidia specific question , one pretty big announcement today gm essentially getting $ 2.25 billion investment softbank . maybe could least provide quick overview thought little team large amount money think 'll end using 'll need want essentially compete create self-driving vehicle well . well think investment show fast industry moving , important challenge 're trying solve . 's big complex problem requires lot investment . think want right . hopefully , 're going spend lot money nvidia gpus data center , n't know . would pretty nice . think , see huge growth marketplace , big investment , lot -- lot start-ups . q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapirocompanies acquiring start-ups . bigger company acquiring start-ups . think consolidation . may use money . , think capital intensive build vehicle build data center required put safe car road . yes . guess quick follow-up . give somebody large amount money , would kind structure thinking term would need kind create environment create self-driving car ? obviously , nvidia chip would list . else kind product general would need go path ? yes , ca n't speak gm 're going . , think creation deployment ï¬‚eets . need collect data simulate data , think , key thing . 're probably hiring people build team . got . turning back earlier slide , 've got $ 20 billion tam robo-taxis , $ 40 billion self-driving vehicle , self-driving car . think asp segment . would trend -- well , guess , 2020 kind 2025 ? think -- nvidia , , 're developing scalable platform . benefit customer single unified architecture . whether 're level 2 plus 2 , level 3 , level 4 , level 5 ultimately , 're starting high end , 're going bring . either way , 's single development effort ; they're deploy different team different type technology . there's huge benefit space . 're hundred dollar asp lower level autonomy several thousand robo-taxi . guess , 's kind driving large difference term asp content ? well , drive pegasus highest level platform 've unveiled far . 2 xavier processor 2 next-generation high-end gpus . rated 320 trillion operation per second . hugely powerful energy-eï¬ƒcient supercomputer car , whereas held single xavier processor rated 30 trillion . , 's scalable approach . work automaker tier 1 develop right level compute 're trying accomplish . q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiro right . check box , 'll turn back autonomous second . guy also pretty big presence infotainment . think term type content 'll see infotainment side create self-driving vehicle well ? think u company , several year ago , shifted focus away infotainment , basic infotainment , initially saw huge growth . shifted away autonomous focusing engineering r & deep learning processing sensor data . think 're going see time , transition personal revenue infotainment autonomous . said though , think 's going next generation infotainment infused ai . 's see playing space . thing gesture recognition , facial recognition , speech recognition , require lot processing standard graphic processor 's going vehicle . think 'll see resurgence new feature new capability . -- 're talking fully driverless vehicle , get inside , could hotel wheel , oï¬ƒce wheel , living room wheel . case , sure , think see even graphics- intensive processing might -- window could become sort like holodeck . transformed different environment watch movie play game thing like . play ( computer ) , right ? could , sure . come -- road lead nvidia , think , 're trying say . exactly . perfect . turning back little bit autonomous side . there's always debate term type product need self-driving vehicle . maybe help u understand technical explanation need nvidia product , ca n't use another person -- another competitor get level 5 driving ? think , u , safety important thing endeavor . discussed earlier pretty much every confidence , right ? 're going save life autonomous vehicle road . safely requires massive amount processing . need redundancy diversity algorithm . want able ensure 're able detect everything 's going around u incredible precision detect q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro steves q - unidentified participant - danny shapiro q - unidentified participant - danny shapiroobjects understand 're , 're moving intent understand behavior . done ai . every time new neural network , requires processing . , think industry recognized ai way . computer vision -- sustainable early , hard coded algorithm detect object given away artificial intelligence . right . think 'll one opening question . think another big announcement actually virtual reality testing vehicle . maybe -- 'm guessing ca n't name company describe adoption look like term people using vr atmosphere test drive car make intelligent . yes , think , mean , 've seen news year company developed in-house simulation . 's really vital part able scale really able validate what's created , right ? 've done really put together system we're developing using house . 'll rolling customer enable better scale -- , reality need able drive many mile could humanly life -- lifetime test ï¬‚eets . ï¬‚exibility simulating using expertise nvidia graphic side well using ai able generate new scene take even scene maybe 'd driven car we've recorded data sunny day . resimulate create rainstorm fog snowstorm . multiplicative factor term data 've actually obtained data simulate achieve higher level reliability essentially certify , car handle need handle . 'm going stop real quick , see 's question audience . ( inaudible ) right ? well ( inaudible ) think put back ( inaudible ) . yes . n't good answer . think 're trying develop best product try -- understand . think 's true across q - unidentified participant - danny shapiro q - unidentified participant - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro stevesindustries , right , people want competition see benefit . think , u , 're developing best product , highest performing delivering fair value . usually , mean , 've seen jensen 's keynote , right , deliver compared competition huge cost saving . think 're thing vehicle , people sometimes say , `` oh , chip expensive . '' well n't realize look platform deliver system 's able replace 4 , 5 , 6 silver box car . also development cost much le nvidia 've created tool , long history , many part deliver , 're able scale multiple system . , think customer recognize value bring table . ( inaudible ) think question see specialized silicon coming . think development tool infrastructure 've put place widely adopted . think everybody recognizes . reason space moving fast . 's new algorithm weekly practically . need highly -- high level programmability . n't really see changing anytime soon . , car software-defined car , like phone , right ? continue get update . broad base ï¬‚exibility deliver let continue iterate come new algorithm try new approach . 's going new sensor get added different data format . , -- pay close attention competition . push u . 's good . force u alert continue create higher level performance , higher level integration , energy eï¬ƒcient possibly . think key thing look gpus today , mean , new gpus tensor core gpus . continue evolve gpu well . 's lot custom silicon inside n't year ago graphic . 's like 're competing new technology n't . continue evolve improve ai capability well . essentially , custom ai asic . happens able play video game well . ( inaudible ) know 'm robot ? know n't simulation ? . something worry . 're able deliver solution superhuman certain level perception specific task . getting rethought original thinking quite different . - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiroi guess . case 's another questioner , turn back . basically , think negative headline 've seen uber ride , terrible thing happened . exactly think going biggest hurdle let 's call 2021 , safe , term get self-driving car ? nvidia essentially help solve problem ? well , think simulation piece play big role . want able show technology safe . need able prove 's reliable . say 's going . , able simulate let u achieve higher level number scenario invalidate . think legislation moving forward enable . think 'll different type rule different region world . , 'll ready . term spending , since 're going get closer closer self- driving car , within 3 four year , message people investing spending like robo-taxi company going essentially edge already best technology . 're going able start deploying car faster ? think 's going evolve term automotive company eventually , probably obsolete become larger larger monopoly effectively , right ? think spending relative , guess , time frame ? kind lag need order self-driving car still production ready ? yes . 's -- n't know really good answer . mean , think spend lot money make progress . think investment , , good development engineer bring right technology able deploy ï¬‚eets , able back-end infrastructure . , think 's different business model different player . think go direction . think deploy level 5 solution . much easier , course , dial back level 4 level 3 case . , customer starting lower level autonomy slowly building . think 's going work way . n't see necessarily one camp winning . right . guess one high-level one . 've given tam number . think unit term ramp ? think 's little bit diï¬ƒcult . 1,000 asp car , seeing unit ramp , think , would pretty helpful . look 2020 2025 , 's like rough cadence ? q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiro q - mitchell toshiro steves - danny shapiroi n't think -- would refer market analyst . mean sort number . really n't disclosed . think number put like 20 million 2035 robo-taxi number . exactly ramp go something 's totally known point . okay , perfect . last question anyone audience ? everyone 's exhausted . need get robo-taxi go home . perfect . thank , . thank . right . thanks much , everyone .
