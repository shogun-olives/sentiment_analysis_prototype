okay . good morning , everyone . mark murphy , software analyst j.p. morgan . absolute pleasure morning rajesh jha , evp oﬃce product group microsoft . rajesh , thank much making trip u . well , thanks . , perhaps start trying put oﬃce high-level perspective . many juncture 've lived last 10 20 year . people would basically assume oﬃce pretty penetrated , right , pretty saturated . look today , 's $ 45 billion business . 's growing low-teens . think perspective . 's larger oracle , 's larger sap , growing faster . view key ingredient ? think broader phenomenon kind driving oﬃce business deliver durable growth ? mean , technology evolved , importantly , scenario focused 're working customer , taking look trend , evolved year well . ten year , 12 year ago , started oﬃce 365. vision -- way pandemic , vision time allow people work anywhere , place , time . delivering productivity communication collaboration solution , enterprise-grade security compliance . mark murphyand think thing got right early really trying work customer get make transition cloud term . choose go cloud , decade ago . others , hybrid set-up . whether , 's user moved cloud , stayed pram [ ph ] workload moved cloud . five year ago , really took step back felt -- way , one thing cloud economy scale , economy skill . microsoft , took upon actually keep customer updated integrated got customer version product , enabled lot new scenario . allowed u create something like microsoft team . would never able create something like microsoft team classic on-premises world . cloud , customer base line different infrastructure . team , took step back said , 's apps , 's device , 's people group bring sync async communication collab together . security compliance , knew area needed investment . system record , system engagement started come together , knew invest automation power platform . guess would say , mark , thing taken -- 've stayed word productivity , 've taken broader broader perspective oﬃce . initially information worker even information worker , go back oﬃce way back . people thought saturated oﬃce creation . word , excel [ ph ] , creation , collaboration communication security compliance automation . n't stop information worker . 80 % worker planet first-line worker , front-line worker . company go digital transformation front-line worker incredibly important productivity . 've gone information worker , knowledge worker , front-line worker , small business , tam . one thing productivity , think addressable market . continue grow addressable market creation tool , collaboration tool , security , compliance , think employee experience productivity , especially hybrid world , come together . 'm incredibly excited stay , know journey define productivity individual level , team level , org level . 's amazing vision . rajesh , look back march quarter . aggregate microsoft , solid quarter . came , raised forecast oﬃce . contrast , many software company saw slowdown . investor concerned perhaps whole demand environment moving forward pandemic . get question , reopening caused rajesh jha mark murphyzoom slow , right ? n't cause team slow , instance ? perspective , impact pandemic lockdown well pivot remote work whole oﬃce business ? yeah . pandemic , definitely accelerated move cloud many costumer . mean , growth saw oﬃce 365 microsoft team , even small business , really reinvent new way working . , brought forward lot people moving cloud perhaps sideline , perhaps fully using cloud . , created thing like trial let get onboard really quickly . created specific small business offering like team essential , affordable collaboration , meeting tool , usage never higher . even coming pandemic , 's never higher . people think , case ? well , team 's multimodal . team meeting solution . team , said , hey , group people collaborate ? whether 'd know , project team board room , first-line worker working manager , work ? 's synchronous asynchronous , 's across different time zone , different shift . 's people either face-to-face distributed . , even actual number minute meeting go , collaboration , especially 're trying go digital transformation , 're digitizing business process . need collaboration never greater . , usage team continues grow , 's team oﬃce 365. take look usage today oﬃce 365 , 's never higher module . customer would use four module , maybe using six module . 's number module , depth usage module continues grow . , wonder , think hybrid world , digital tool -- work get represented , work get done , 's collaboration happens . 's work ﬂexibly across different time zone , across base time . know , think strong base line , growing base line usage consumption , continue grow -- scenario want serve customer , whether 'd phone system team , whether 'd house space -- whether 'd focus room , open collaboration space , conference room , small-medium-large different job , involve team . thought employee experience viva , balance productivity , wellness , learning , knowledge . device become incredibly important , try virtualize device window 365. usage never higher , 'm excited continue serve customer hybrid world . rajesh jha mark murphy rajesh jhaso , great hear usage never higher , want come back touch many product mentioned ... yeah . including phone team device . let 's start assumption moment remote work hybrid work permanent societal shift , going u . type differentiated experience creating currently , perhaps , maybe 're even considering yet , right ? try help worker connect collaborate world ? yeah . mean , couple thing would note . couple thing would note . first , think hybrid work , individual one thing recently released latest work trend index . interviewed 30,000 information worker first-line worker across 30 different country . thing microsoft 365 oﬃce 366 massive amount signal . see lot data usage pattern communication pattern . would heard u talk thing called hybrid paradox , three-fourth employee , want ﬂexibility work . whether work oﬃce space work elsewhere , time two-thirds employee also want face-to-face time colleague . paradox . three-fourth , want ﬂexibility . two-third , two-third say hey want face-to-face build energy . thing 'll say striking , even though intuitively [ ph ] reﬂect , make sense ; remote work , hybrid work tends make strong tie stronger , weak tie weaker . important , . -- serendipity , water cooler , 're coming conference room , meeting talking somebody immediate work group , immediate work group strong tie . matter organization set org structure , always done hierarchical manner , work transcend boundary , 's weak tie . thinking , let 's take microsoft viva , example , application 's built microsoft team . team putting [ ph ] group center , people center , bringing right apps , right data , right ai , right automation people . viva , hybrid work , 've heard triple bump day people took three peek , one lunch , one lunch one evening going bed . 's like productivity balanced well-being . mark murphy rajesh jha mark murphy rajesh jha mark murphy rajesh jhaat microsoft alone , third employee started pandemic . world costumer higher attrition , new people joining , remote work ; knowledge get discovered ? create knowledge ? get discovered ? balance wellness effectively ? learning take place ﬂow work ? different team align core mission ? thing , front-line worker connect leadership ? thing think broadly employee experience world strong tie tend get stronger , weak tie tend get weaker . thing come ﬂow , would say microsoft team viva , thing thinking . document today super monolithic . get document ﬂow communication , also hand together document thing like microsoft loop ? got lot thing gotten going learn , 're going iterate [ ph ] . mentioned loop end , correct ? yes . want make sure . 's okay . 'll come back well . yeah , okay . oﬃce 365 commercial bulk business . recently ran survey showing u o365 going exceed 60 % penetration corporate employee , right , coming year , high number . 've seat count growth running around 16 % recent quarter , shared hit 345 billion seat oﬃce 365 , let begin simple question , much runway see seat growth ? yeah , mean , [ ph ] growth , think three different dimension . think three different dimension . first , let 's talk said . seat growth . seat growth , billion information worker , projection 2025 information knowledge worker ; couple billion first-line worker front-lines transformation mark murphy rajesh jha mark murphybusiness process . small business , industry-specific role offering , education . think broadly lot room grow seat oﬃce 365. dimension addressable market . , oﬃce 365 , 's creation tool , collaboration tool , communication tool . 's security compliance , 's employee experience , 's learning , knowledge management , 's content management , know even industry like phone system , involve future , space evolve allow hybrid work . think addressable market pretty broad . mean , 's great thing productivity . like heart modern economy . , always start take step back take inclusively look productivity . final item 'd say , talked usage usage never higher , usage , customer , see opted renewal , lesser discounting , thing like e5 's premier tier , bring together customer early day seeing play installed base . aperture broader billion information worker , right ? go well beyond . mentioned e5 , wanted touch moment . sense , much value packed skus e3 , e5 . speculation e7 coming point , think process packing value skus monetizing ? 'd say , know last year , said 8 % installed base , commercial oﬃces installed base moved e5 , like , still early . remember , know , , talking information worker . , like said , aim go broader smb first-line worker , industry-specific role offering , mix e5 play time depends flws , probably e5 user . information worker quite , early still -- cycle . value , term value e5 , agree . mean lot customer . customer choose get bundle , choose get security offering , compliance offering , phone system offering , analytics offering , choose get separately . think value taken together customer e5 skus , many actually want get entire suite , 's incredible value . rajesh . team , part incredible value . rajesh jha mark murphy rajesh jha yeah . couple year ago , satya described team , believe said 's fastest growing app seen . step back , thinking . 's pretty big statement , right , oﬃce grew quickly , loop [ ph ] grew quickly , exchange grew quickly . earlier year , believe said team crossed 270 million monthly active , right . 's far behind oﬃce 365 commercial seat . view significance team ? step back say , put u historical context u , , team experience would say fundamentally different competing product world . 's great question , mark . mean , 've oﬃce around oﬃce business long time , would say team remarkable . think fundamental -- even said make different ? make different fact 's multimodal . 's one modality meeting , one modality chat , one modality creation . 's -- team , take step back said , whatif n't start tool first , started people first group first . people congregate together , whether informal chat formal group channel , bring right modality chat meeting phone system document file dashboard business automation , bring together . tool find , n't go tool-to-tool job , group , work group 20 people independently seek different tool , 's going work . team , remarkable see relevant board room , ceo leadership team taking look business performance shared context shop ﬂoor , seeing success , broad success . recent cio survey showed 50 % cio standardizing microsoft team , three year number projected get two-thirds . really remarkable team multimodality application , usage , fact 's platform . 's platform ecosystem transcends given device . isv even microsoft , like 're creating thing like microsoft viva application team . write application microsoft team , application run window , mac , web , mobile device , io angular . servicenow workday adobe monday.com lot lot isvs . fact , take look number third-party custom application built microsoft team , two year ago , grown 10x . , ecosystem real differentiation team . ecosystem also play device side . poly , logitech , zebra , mark murphy rajesh jha mark murphy rajesh jhaand folk building device optimized microsoft team . tel-co operator connecting backplane microsoft backplane . customer want microsoft team phone collaboration conferencing configuration go . feel base line , differentiated point view space , company ' space evolves team room , phone system evolves , employee experience evolves , yeah team truly special . said tool find . yeah . team phone finding lot people . help u understand strategy ? far ambition stretching team phone would think scale specific opportunity ? yeah , know , mean , see 's interesting . seems obvious , phone course make sense anchored desk anymore . especially hybrid work , phone got around individual , 's got around person , desk . lot customer want get legacy pbx system something much person-centric setup hydro world . one thing phone , 's -- people n't -- work somebody , like three chat , want escalate quickly phone call . quickly synchronous modality , go back asynchronous modality . , continuum phone system collaboration . even start phone call want bring whiteboard , want able bring shared -- screen sharing , actually communicate quickly . think blending phone offering person-centric whether 'd voip-based pstn-based . whether 'd inside organization , whether 'd across organization . see broad demand phone across different industry shape size . , 80 million people use team phone different ﬂavours . thing exciting time value customer . decide get legacy pbxs phone system , time value week . week get configured . backplane . team multimodal , 're configured team , 're configured directory add phone question week , 's year making . mark murphy rajesh jhaso hugely cost effective , ﬂexible , multimodal . think real differentiated perspective regarding [ ph ] phone . look oﬃce 365 purchased , 45 % purchase microsoft 365. think people audience would probably think microsoft 365 set finished application service . heard refer -- basically rich developer platform . 've alluded foundation underneath , microsoft graph ﬂuid framework . way help make tangible kind non-technical audience , try explain differentiation . think really important point , mark . mean , microsoft 365 set finished service sure . time-to-value customer , whether creativity solution productivity collab . want get time-to-value really quick . first foremost , 's also platform . microsoft sound [ ph ] build every single productivity application , project management application . team set platform like earlier talked . 'll find zoom team store , 'll find ringcentral team store . going find sort project management whiteboard company team store . ux layer alone ui layer , platform people plug-in . really customer ' choice end day plug-in . even ux layer team platform data layer , call data layer , microsoft graph . satya said , think 's right characterization . microsoft graph important database company . database company ' employee work , meeting , document shared , document trending . know project deadline different people . database microsoft run massive amount ai give insight , deep insight right recommendation ﬂow work . microsoft graph extensible platform . one microsoft 365 application writes graph , get value graph , allow third party also write graph get value graph . graph course owned customer , right permission exist , right control exists . part microsoft 365 platform , know user experience composable . , 've done today microsoft loop , talked microsoft loop , 'm really excited microsoft loop , document tended somewhat monolithic user go document , course team hang document around group , microsoft loop allow document decomposed . example , 've got project update table bunch u need update . instead telling everybody , hey go update table , take table , snippet mark murphy rajesh jha mark murphyof document chat email send . people started fill , 's always live . go back document , show state . chat show state , email show state . take component put word document , always live connected . extensible third party participate . microsoft 365 , finished service , focus time-to-value , want make extensible made platform ux layer data layer . canvas surface area , 're describing u graph data , ai , seem advertising opportunity made comment january . advertising business 10 billion trailing 12- month revenue , incredible stat .
