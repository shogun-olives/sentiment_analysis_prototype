's consumer metaverse . avatar buy kash 's avatar ... buy beer , 'd rather real beer . 'd rather real beer avatar buy avatar beer , like 'll monetization thing consumer metaverse . 's q - kash rangan - judson althoffcommercial meter , people engaging experiential collaboration metaverse , think 's opportunity bring people around world different perspective collaborate . actually amount passion thing call industrial metaverse , real tangible outcome 're driving customer today . think combining set technology , iot capability come create sensor fabric industrial process , manufacturing environment , supply chain logistics scenario . sensor fabric , feed large-scale cloud-based analytics solution , large data store . reason top machine learning create call digital twin environment simulate outcome . think , make anything move anything , create carbon footprint . simulate infinitely cloud make move , help create better product , cost effectively lower carbon footprint lower water utilization , sustainably ever . see real progress happening today company like coca-cola , unilever , ab inbev , gm , grupo bimbo across industry able model process , save energy , reduce waste solution pay . take cloud tool solve , think would say , beginning curve adoption growth long-term cloud really drive business outcome outcome society really matter . question topic 'm petrified . n't know much . i'm ( multiple speaker ) -- many client know really like security , 's hot topic , 's hugely relevant thing changed since gave interest security 12 , 13 year back . customer conversation security like day ? important ? think 're right . lot customer -- every customer concerned security buster . concerned others . think 're new world cyber activity driven nation state level preparing customer defend hard work . posture take customer way navigate zero trust methodology . pervasive across everything identity backplane endpoint management , cloud application security model even look threat intelligence event incident management capability . 's 're passionate needing asset part microsoft cloud mere active wiring together part described , creates vulnerability 's scene find lot attack vector exist today . security inherent every product build , also added capability across endpoint , identity backplanes , q - kash rangan - judson althoffcloud app model , event incident management , customer demand need world today . look , huge body work u make sure empower customer successful digital era digital business , course , vulnerable cyber crime traditional one . think take zero trust posture , much culture operate company technology , couple together strong cyber foundation , get place institution secure . 'm le insecure security . anybody else last opportunity pose question judson ? , one final one . zoom back little bit . underappreciating respect product market microsoft participating n't get enough question u really take even customer n't know , oh , 've got unbelievable product say could talking next year 're talking today ? sure . yeah . think come back one question asked earlier , traverse complex customer environment weave together everything create unique business value . made comment earlier , like feel like train community think microsoft 365 competitive , competitive azure may dynamic competitive security offering might . course , great measure u share take one category . combined value whole bring microsoft cloud , think , something really underestimated . look best customer relationship , leveraged power portfolio , discreetly category compete , bring together way new innovation unlocked . maybe bridge two , example , talked team platform citizen development power platform . talked industrial metaverse . unilever company 've working five year , digitizing factory , digitized 100 factory around world . course , industrial metaverse asset allowing run eﬃciently effectively sustainably ever . power way industrial metaverse , digital twin connect back team platform frontline worker helping everything skill evolution skill development , employee satisfaction worker retention boardroom conceive capability front line drive effective eﬃcient unilever time . q - kash rangan - judson althoff q - kash rangan - judson althoff q - kash rangan - judson althoffand like order sort compose like value , 'd think collaboration environment , 'd think low-code no-code environment . 'd think business application portfolio . 'd think cloud data . look , microsoft offering thing together . 're best marry portfolio intellectual property customer ' business need , 's we're going go . yeah . commercial cloud $ 100 billion run rate business , roughly like commercial cloud ? n't know whether 'm allowed say ... 's model . 's model . seen last week . ( multiple speaker ) back help . 's roughly . wanted say 's often see $ 100 billion-ish running business growing 25 % , 30 % .
