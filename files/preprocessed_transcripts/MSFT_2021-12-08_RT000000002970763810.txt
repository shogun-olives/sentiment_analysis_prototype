's really changing microsoft 365. see new opportunity , new avenue deliver kind productivity collaboration experience going drive seat growth . think m365 also arpu play , talk want . seat side , 's couple different vector think interesting . one really frankly gotten lot recognition last two year kind going back first question , around notion front line first line worker . population set employee base kind left behind . service professional , retail professional , manufacturing shop ï¬‚oor professional , healthcare professional , folk n't necessarily sit desk day sort type away like lot u . first line everything , sale , service , support , obviously , transportation , safety , security , health . 've seen course last two year important economy . population historically kind left behind term connected rest workforce . lot ceo , cio , business leader talk interested lighting able connect population rest employee base able lead communicate mission alignment . q - raimo lenschow - kirk koenigsbauerthat 's also big chunk digital transformation happening sort every one industry 've referencing . first line worker , frontline worker experience really getting digitized massive way . 's big seat growth driver u . -- another one think pretty important u , 've talked past smb space , small mid-sized business base . would sort put finer point small business opportunity . sort solopreneur say 10 , 20 , 25 seat something along line . 's really -- feel like 's really big opportunity microsoft 365 also . created bunch new skus course last year microsoft 365 put sort power platform hand small business , including really small business , 's big opportunity u . fact , last week , also announced new sku called microsoft team essential , essentially product specifically designed small business space , super competitive , $ 4 month , one sort meeting conferencing solution . think 's big deal . also personally get pretty excited security offering small business space . ca n't forget lot big company , 's lot focus ransomware fishing stuff , 's happening small business space , . frankly , n't tooling expertise level . n't big shop partner sort supporting day-to-day basis . security important . last one guess would say around emerging market . observed emerging market , course , microsoft broadly , would say focus largely large sort organization given emerging market developing market . think 's lot opportunity sort breadth , smaller organization , mid-size smbs . team really vector avenue changing dynamic important way . n't know , see lot opportunity m365 drive seat going forward . 've seen good growth flw , first line worker piece smb space last couple quarter . yes , . yes , exactly . mentioned arpu already , could like , volume price oem , remember made mistake year ago , said , price increase amy kind killed call . selling value customer . -- different skus term like adoption opportunity ? yes . yes . well , think 're right articulate . mean , microsoft 365 opportunity seat growth , also arpu growth well . would say originally , frankly , much arpu play initially converting seat on-prem basic oï¬ƒce 365 workload broader m365 suite . see quite bit headroom ahead u . right post last couple quarter , e5 offering , think q - raimo lenschow - kirk koenigsbauer q - raimo lenschow - kirk koenigsbauer q - raimo lenschow - kirk koenigsbaueras highest -- folk n't follow along , minutia skus . sort highest premium tier microsoft 365. right 8 % installed base . feel like 've got lot upside , whether 's referenced security brieï¬‚y smb space . lot organization looking provide kind security compliance identity solution required today . 's big chunk management value 's , 's big chunk call phone system modern way sort weight-based calling pstn-based calling . think 's quite bit headroom left e5 space . think , overall , little bit balance , course , drive skus , right , seat 'd raise arpu 's -- think balance either side . see opportunity vector . -- , seem remember like quarter ago , talked e3 hero ? like still like e1 e3 cover-up ? yes . 's little , 's -- number different skus address large organization , large enterprise , mid-size company small business , host different skus . use sort nomenclature e1 , e3 , e5 . reason , n't like , even number , guess . yes . enterprise skus . set skus smb side . course , consumer business 50 million subscriber . yes , -- objective , course , penetrate market customer way , whether 's e3 sku whatever sort expand room house sort analogy use internally drive higher arpu scenario . whether 's maybe 're starting basic productivity collaboration , 's really natural opportunity attach security top compliance top phone system top .
