good afternoon , everyone . welcome bloomberg intelligence , state database market cloud webinar today arguably smartest existing database come across ( inaudible ) . start housekeeping item , today 's presentation recorded available playback . access replay via link sent email bloomberg webinars . bottom slide window , adjust volume maximize screen . ask question submitting one right slide . address question conclusion presentation . also quick word bloomberg intelligence , provide in-depth research data industry , company , credit litigation , etcetera . 300- plus people department . cover close 2,000 company . -- access research terminal bi . agenda today talk little bit overall state database market . much going grow ? 's oracle 's cloud strategy ? comparing amazon oracle microsoft . alternative database technology nosql data lake carl present summary conclusion . , let pas presentation carl go discussion . thank much , anurag ( ph ) get started topic today , let give little bit introduction , know . name carl olofson . research vice president idc , covering data management software . 've industry 40 year . spent part time programmer-consultant , much time software development , building database management software product manager marketing product manager past 21 year , 've working idc , analyzing researching market . time course , 've seen lot change 'll seeing change reï¬‚ected remark today . n't begin talking overall state market ? general term , 're going -- high level revenue observation overall market growth relational database , include product like oracle database microsoft sequel server ibm db2 forth , grew 2016 2017 6.9 % . saw growth happening cloud , surprise strongest growth shown amazon web service product rds aurora redshift microsoft product sequel database , whereas tepid declining growth -- sort big mainstay industry oracle , ibm , sap teradata . public cloud service share market approximately 11 % present driver include overall data growth . say amount -- volume data world rapidly 's growing ; edge iot data analytics , management analysis edge important data science . non-relational space , includes legacy product run mainframe many computer hierarchical navigational nature well end user database multi-value database . market grew 2.2 % 2016 2017 , , 's stable market . customer relationship decade old . application built-in database dependent database people reluctant change . interesting vendor space intersystems , modernized database something completely different characteristic product called cache . 's mostly found healthcare sector united state , 's variety sector country , especially western europe australia new zealand . dynamic data management software market market includes thing typically refer data lake hadoop software well sequel database . 's called dynamic unlike two product market require scheme ( ph ) , word , ingest data defined system . also tell knowledge definition rule data exists program code rather form definition within database management system . overall market growth space 2016 2017 62 % dominant vendor microsoft hdinsight cosmos db amazon emr dynamodb . new development on-prem present , cloud revenue drive growth ? would -- would think development implementation on-prem , would cloud driving growth 's product open source . people developing gradually implementing thing production using open - - open source model . open source model slow growth model 's subscription-based 's based people using product first , getting certain point maturity use product acquiring subscription . growth rate slower . whereas cloud , buy subscription soon go pay use technology cloud 's cloud revenue growing faster on-prem revenue , even though user base larger prem cloud . eventually sort normalize . driver space include new operational data model , thing managing data smart apps handheld device forth . handling routing data maybe coming sensor , also general online state management application gaming application specialized application typically internet based require lot state data operate well specialized data analytics require functionality 's native relational system . look competitive situation amongst vendor three market described relational area , oracle continues dominate 42 % market , microsoft 24 % , ibm 13 % . interesting amazon web service 3 % , look really small 's really small , fast -- one faster growing -- piece pie getting bigger , whereas ibm 13 % , piece pie getting smaller . sap fairly stable . really expect lot growth driving many customer hanna . sort tapered bit past year , expect growth continue , strong , fairly strong nonetheless . lot damper people moving hanna , people moving legacy sap product sap ase sap iq . non-relational space , actually right hand side screen , dominant vendor microsoft access , followed ibm ims -- mainframe hierarchical database see intersystems 14 % . company growing steadily . word 10 year ago , sort next 's got 14 % . 's actually become third largest vendor space . important one continue watch . dynamic data management software market , middle , see microsoft largest share little bit -- 've mentioned , dynamo , sorry , cosmos db hdinsight amazon following emr , dynamodb , 's going continue battle . google -- bigtable , google going become important player future cloudera hortonworks interesting recently announced merger . sure going mean company . making long-range projection would little bit irresponsible . however , think they're going continue important space . okay . foretasted database market growth expect relational database market grow 7.7 % . compound annual growth rate 2022 driver include continued need analytic -- need analytic transaction processing , mean blending analytic query transaction processing . transaction processing today involves simple background query know , 're processing order , look customer sort thing . analytic query , thing like looking pattern data , previously possible overhead demand 's placed database , new model involve ( inaudible ) memory-optimized data management . 're capable transaction fairly sophisticated , full-on multi-table joint type query operation , fairly sophisticated analytic operation data analytic transaction processing , think merger oltp olap , going become increasingly important . also higher quarter analytics machine learning , one thing we're finding lot experimentation using hadoop spark deep analytics machine learning still going use -- 're still used continue used thing , many case , people found , need discipline relational database 're moving functionality back relational sphere . cloud significant factor relational database last couple year forecast . word , 's five year forecast . lot company preparing move cloud , n't moved much -- much cloud . smaller company moved production data cloud leading-edge customer moved data cloud -- production data cloud , . 's thing watch . non-relational database expected decline 2.2 % compound annual growth rate 2022. 's five-year compound annual growth rate way . customer -- user looking move cloud -- user looking move cloud using mainframe , hierarchical navigation database considering rewriting application . year , would n't consider , kept system , 're seeing total benefit moving cloud supersedes cost risk involved rewriting application . 're starting look . multi-value database probably ï¬‚at , decline , important know . like pick database forth end user legacy mainframe decline . lot end user database functionality made available mean , various kind memory , analytics sandbox thing people used use , thing like microsoft access forth . think going , general decline . dynamic data management software market system expected grow -- 30 % cagr 2022 , five-year cagr 's following fairly normal growth curve market . 'm sure others aggressive forecast , 're dealing space 's mostly open source , revenue forecast estimate need necessarily conservative . rapid growth open source usage resulted lot -- lot user , lot revenue , think account subscribe five- year period 's going major growth driver space . document database also becoming business-friendly . 're thing like 're including support asset transaction , never existed document database , well except marklogic , document database 're also adding enterprise-level security feature . obviously data security major concern everyone day going putting data , especially personal identifying information document database , need make sure 're secure ca n't hacked . data lake space , 're settling supporting role . year ago people thought hadoop going take everything . n't quite work way . hadoop course designed data collection space , driven mapreduce . however , mapreduce today appears adopting limited role initial ingest processing , sorting , filtering formatting organizing data rest work , analytic work seems handed spark . hdfs survives file -- standardize file format environment continue , 's unclear much rest hadoop cluster management , file management technology actually come play , especially people move data lake cloud look see data cloud native object storage run spark directly , seems raising model use . also mean cloudera hortonworks combination need basically rise general den confusion respect data lake offering comprehensive enterprise-friendly package capability make straightforward deploy manage . okay . forecasting five-year forecast three market . know print small . think access slide . look leisure . see , growth rate mentioned reï¬‚ected . interesting thing notice forecast top part column cloud forecast bottom part on-prem . see , relational database , on-prem actually ï¬‚at , growing , 's growing percentage point 2 le 2 % think . whereas dynamic data management software space , cloud portion part -- portion growing . gradual growth on-prem 's people deployed various document database like mongodb couchbase forth purchasing license protect investment , effort investment putting corporate information least business important data system . grow , expect deploying cloud lot new development going cloud simple reason cloud non-demand environment development . way sort say , want server certain size , certain amount storage development work immediately 's . whereas 're operating -- non-prem context , make requisition server , storage , reserve time system , etcetera , etcetera slows development process living agile time slow go . non-relational database picture right . see 's declining . part 's showing growth cloud . 'll element , probably mostly end user space , thing like file maker forth , -- growing cloud way picture look . okay . far oracle 's cloud strategy concerned , lot question come . 's important understand cloud critical success factor oracle . absolute priority move customer many possible oracle cloud , cloud , oracle cloud . 's important maintain account control , always key oracle success 's largely reason oracle came autonomous database service versus oracle autonomous data warehouse service 've talking lot transactional service , -- we'll learn oracle openworld . thing necessary order two thing . one demonstrate value cloud place longer assume responsibility physical management database , also n't apply patch . n't thing , mean database going available time . 's going running top performance level dba technical people work developer create application adjust system match enterprise need rather constantly tuning database . 's value proposition oracle , kind database nutshell . honest clear demonstration cloud , oracle cloud important , course , autonomous database managed oracle personnel , presumably knowledgeable expert managing environment also enjoy economy scale managing multiple customer instance time therefore effort -- effort spread across work well customer . really important oracle mean 're successful program , retain bulk database customer base , said , 's key . customer move oracle database cloud , aws azure google something else , would bad oracle n't level account control . split customer 's attention interaction cloud provider could ultimately mean customer spends le oracle le inï¬‚uenced oracle . even could contemplate moving another database system aurora spanner something else would disaster oracle . keeping oracle customer oracle cloud important . ideally customer also oracle cloud , use oracle infrastructure service non-oracle workload . word , they'll choose keep data operation together 's obviously -- that's 're pushing forward well hear , read quarterly report management remark , 'll see infrastructure service coming time reason . also want attract new customer . important oracle historically really good attracting new customer reason pretty simple . oracle large expensive direct sale force direct sale force order get -- justify cost sale 's embedded using sale force , sale force concentrated largest user , mean smaller user really n't get attention . therefore oracle hard time attracting . oracle tended respond problem working third party isps consultant bring smaller customer , sometimes get way product strategy historically , n't done real good job managing together . moving cloud alleviates essential problem oracle cloud provides direct mean ordering service people sign online adopt pay grow pricing model , mean 're using little data , pay little processor use , pay attractive several level . one oracle customer n't deal sale person , lot people glad . know exactly 're getting control account progress . fact , said even larger customer , model reduces amount interaction need salesperson , move cloud see exactly stand . audit , everybody hate , instead see stand online make adjustment accordingly 's -- everything transparent improve customer relation customer relation oracle , typically find technologist really like oracle . dba really like oracle . program really like oracle . business people n't , friction that's created oracle audit deal oracle sale force , powerfully motivated increased sale wherever possible . could help customer relation . question byol bring license , largely motivated customer demand n't originally part oracle cloud plan , oracle found lot customer wanted apply value existing license cloud order get move cloud swiftly , adopted policy , remove friction account apply license cloud get credit . another reason customer want use license least use perpetual used license traditional form 're license management people typically lawyer contract management people . uncomfortable subscription dealt . understand perpetual use license contract support contract well 've working year . 're sure implication switching subscription . think time , switch subscription model give ï¬‚exibility . obviously , oracle like give guaranteed revenue stream , time reluctance byol policy general , policy reporting perpetual used license cloud necessary overcome objection mentioned get people cloud sooner . comparing amazon , oracle microsoft relational database sphere , really represent different -- background different . amazon -- sort darling new application developer . application developer come aws build application make available user cloud . really like everything amazon relation , need -- transactional relational database , naturally turn amazon . rds -- relational database service , number option , including number database n't control oracle microsoft sql postgresql . however , aurora one 's managed amazon , optimized amazon aws environment customer like idea , mysql service layer take code 's mysql run around also postgresql service layer , go either depending 've chosen write application . 's gaining lot popularity within aws community redshift analytic database . 's sort data warehouse platform 's -- 's fairly frictionless adoption process people committed aws environment . microsoft , situation different microsoft lot legacy obviously make stuff spin around long time . lot existing customer . main challenge move microsoft sql server user azure aql database n't , 's lot harder move customer amazon -- sorry azure , get azure , really need platform optimized azure like cloud environment 's highly dynamic , resource virtualized , system need able take advantage . sql server course designed run defined server , conventional environment storage . 's going give dynamism , resource dynamism would need cloud . -- problem , two -- represented code critical upper level , meant application written sql server would automatically run sql database . would changed . microsoft taking step change application run either platform . seems like help moving microsoft-based application seek azure sql database therefore azure , hope . course lot client , 'm sorry , lot third-party vendor , providing software . existing windows-based vendor reluctant move azure feel frictionless process . n't happened lot . lot new vendor developing azure quite happy . -- 's quite possible could see azure , growing fairly strongly anyway , gain even momentum result shift . emphasis microsoft , everything model . big difference microsoft amazon microsoft heavily prescriptive , meaning put together element need various used case say tool element need thing whereas amazon liked chinese menu . ( inaudible ) amazon say , use azure , use oracle , use microsoft , mysql one , several mysql variance also available aws . option choose . 's confusing 've heard lot people complain 's little hard figure configure environment microsoft cookbook oriented . 's difference . oracle 're coming perspective large enterprise well established . need move enterprise , looking go -- get datacenter go cloud . need move oracle cloud . oracle 's first job customer retention big way course -- largest demanding customer demanding workload requirement 's entire focus . people n't -- lot people may realize oracle actually three relational database system . oracle database time 10 , memory database developed separately acquired mysql also acquired . role time 10 , role time 10 pure in-memory database 's used case memory , pure memory capability critical latency , low lot data processing handle memory size n't huge . mysql basically open source , 's mean attracting new customer . large -- 's large mysql community even though many people community using alternative percona mariadb , oracle still actively involved -- mysql community important prospect base . mentioned , one issue oracle moving customer cloud many customer reluctant increase dependence investment oracle past experience . oracle 's hoping change 've made address . alternative database technology , 's lot excitement past 10 year , regarding called big data system sequel database result -- lot -- lot breathless explanation system going make relational database absolutely 've seen n't happened . however new system address new emerging workload well fact better relational database . relational database continue address workload traditionally addressed well . relational database model actually developed mean providing application neutral query data , prior relational concept , came late 60 's offered dr. ted codd . way report data write complicated program could navigate database , find database , look produce report ted codd 's aim provide system could dynamically query . result strength reporting still relational database architecture designed right , fully normalize data , n't anticipate question going asked . answer mathematically valid question pose along line query . n't know structure . n't collect certain structure . ask question would give answer . 's system work way . others dependent structure retrieve sift find detail 're looking . reason transactional database relational database customer n't want use one architecture transaction another query . necessary provide database work reasonably well classic two dimensional data structure list ledger thing sort back oï¬ƒce accounting thing maintaining customer list stuff like . tough time different shape two dimensional one , precursor structure , graph , embedded structure , graphical object forth demand -- demand style organization either break relational model perspective database work try impose relational model , n't perform , ca n't perform . another aspect relational database require fixed schema . word , relational database schematic database , mean database need know organization data put data . whereas new class dynamic data management service including sequel operate basis idea put data first discover 's organized . capability supported thing like graph database , case people use key value store , document database object-oriented database , actually also schematic , different , also serve job used , especially relationship close language java . alternative technology include data lake called sequel database , originally actually met sequel decided , well 's sound restrictive . call sequel , really -- really mean well support sequel interface . go define data right way mark right way put metadata , execute sequel , 's really relational database . , data lake serve three basic function . first initial ingestion , includes filtering , sorting , regularization . also discovery data need secured forth , may either export relational data warehouse may write object file system analysis spark may run spark directly , 's largely sort deep one-off analysis conducted data scientist looking discover pattern anomaly data . initial ingestion , deep analysis third function long-term data retention 's cheap . related technology data lake includes hadoop sort element apache hadoop constellation project also object storage , particularly native cloud storage aws , s3 , operating mediated hdfs protocol . people starting use parquet file access , enable user manage data common format spark , become sort pay factor standard analytics environment . emerging role data , receiver data , organizer data router , mean becomes kind operational data hub data come external source maybe streaming source case also structured , managed internal source get combined different way moved . say emerging role , believe 'm speaking , believe direction cloudera , hortonworks combination looking pursue . no-sequel space see general benefit , lack schema support mean developer go ahead thing . build make change application . application right , document document database database support address constantly shifting requirement , fulfill agile development model . operational constraint , give greater -- required asset , give greater scalability ï¬‚exibility case data 're putting unrelated data putting database , consistency n't really issue . , issue formal relationship , need little worried thing . document database key operational side sql database content defined application code , self-defining meaning field name actually occur document . document become inconsistent , make analytics diï¬ƒcult , remember 's nothing controlling . put rule -- system put rule force document consistent , 's primary requirement . , commonly used online session management maintaining data , session data user use online environment , important , recoverability user session , also later analysis tracking . also iot tracking iot data tracking gaming application , common popularly used gaming application . sql system include viacom store cassandra , also agile . add new comp -- n't great complex query . 's optimal operation performance issue , 's pretty good analytics , particularly aggregation analytics , large collection data . key value store , mainly used shared persistence application internal data also key value store underlie number document database well . sort like two layer system . got document , management layer top got key value store underneath . actually key value store usually used emerging relational database system well . going wrap formal portion get onto question . relational database remain core back-oï¬ƒce data processing enterprise data warehouse , traditional boring thing . well , lot developer 're going encounter stratum dreamforce whatever call boring , relational database move cloud , whose know . oracle , microsoft amazon , contend ; specialized provider data warehouse functionality like snowï¬‚ake . interesting see work fact teradata cloud called intellicloud well recently developed . data lake nosql primarily served new workload relational database historically ill suited . oracle need broad acceptance oracle cloud thrive long term critical requirement/ . anurag rana carl olofsonmicrosoft jumped front -- azure people -- first came azure , people scratching head said even need , turn really smart thing . amazon web service solid like n't matter u . buy , use stuff , use people 's stuff . deploy manage amazon 's retail mentality . brand product shelf , brand shelf well . buy , still win , 're still business . amazon -- 's amazon 's approach . 's going continue approach , put lot burden making decision consumer . mongodb horton cloudera plus hortonworks growing pretty well . open source model make diï¬ƒcult track predict . mean thing open source order know 's going , really need really strong sense 's using . without revenue account , itc . way survey , 've done time time , need measure user basis product order give better view . think 've got pretty good handle . think mongodb , couchbase others growing pretty well user community eventually translate revenue growth well . -- concludes formal portion presentation . 'm going hand back anurag -- question answer . yeah , lot question carl . let start couple . read one coming listener would request question , please fire ahead . one thing clear 've mentioned , oracle successful long term , oracle cloud succeed obviously seen slowdown perhaps largely pace migration larger database legacy client cloud general . think oracle accelerate shift oracle cloud ? part problem , . largest customer really need largest customer come oracle cloud . also complex situation data center ca n't move -- ca n't turn dime . anurag ranain word , need -- complex oracle installation , lot technology data center . need make lot decision . 've made decision , technology ca n't moved various reason . implementing hybrid cloud strategy 're going continue see going . formulate plan , thing lot technology data center depreciation schedule . 're going stop . 're going turn expensive server storage system 've hit depreciation limit . mean timing becomes important well . really n't expect large number customer moved . think 've seen sort initial rush people pent-up demand . 're past . serious long term -- get kind thing 's going take several year . n't know oracle could speed . one thing -- two thing done . one oracle autonomous database technology 've come attractive enough 's mature shown mature right n't , - - 've got lot people , 've talk beta customer . need another year u get experience people technology production particularly transactional one n't even available yet . thing help accelerate process moving cloud make easier . thing -- thing thing called oracle cloud customer box work like -- work like little piece oracle cloud datacenter . people say , well ca n't move system yet . 'm ready , interact oracle system low latency basis need keep connected internal network . say -- okay , problem , put oracle cloud customer . run oracle database , oracle managing database right oracle clouded customer n't actually support oracle time database , think distant future . put way sort cake eat start process cloud icing part data center actually keeping element data center physically connected internal network system . -- two thing oracle try accelerate process . carl olofsonfair enough seen stock work similar way use hybrid methodology . let 's talk legacy enterprise . 'm large customer 'm oracle shop 've using oracle database several year , 'm fairly big customer . one high paying customer oracle . decide move database cloud , probability would go either oracle amazon microsoft like , way skewed given legacy investment ? n't think 's one size fit answer question depends 're using database many specialized oracle feature using . 's in-house developed application lot plc sequel , 're probably going stick oracle technology . n't mean go oracle cloud . could deploy oracle aws rent think , believe even deploy azure , people going go azure people microsoft-centric , believe , microsoft- centric people oracle system oracle-centric people microsoft system . 're microsoft-centric , 're going -- appeal azure going pretty strong , lot plc sequel , 're going move another data . hand , n't , mostly use sort generic sequel function third party application support multiple database , might consider switching database system part cloud conversion process , mean go anywhere see people considering thing . tend think end day large oracle customer conservative stick oracle 's they've used . 're sure would happen try move database another system . mid-sized one one might go say enterprise db based post solution something like may even switch altogether . every vendor probably know oracle conversion tool supposed help move oracle database platform . , heavy investment oracle , really n't see moving oracle appeal oracle cloud , especially 're also using oracle application pretty great . question , would ask heavily customized oracle environment use lot pl sequel ? two , using lot oracle application ? dependent ib oracle application ? either case , 're likely go oracle go oracle cloud . neither case , -- variety option might consider . anurag rana carl olofson anurag rana carl olofson begs second question case second example gave , easy migrate large database oracle let 's say amazon somebody else ? well first thing would need look characteristic database maybe 's data warehouse . n't know ask proposed target system handle ? answer may eliminate lot would consider potential option . 'm looking large complex database data warehouse instance , 'm probably likely want move oracle probably likely consider another database system 's designed handle large complex data whereas teradata rather something like redchip could n't handle . feedback 've gotten data warehouse user tend comfortable larger highly scalable environment . , 's case , database might say fairly prosaic large , number possible choice 've talked customer migrated database platform seem quite satisfied . 's question 's , 'm moving large complex oracle database , transactional database , would lot due diligence examining potential target moving -- something moving azure sequel database instance . 'd proof concept project determine whether handle load , decide go route , said , -- everybody oracle conversion tool also third party oracle conversion tool . way mean , would also assume risk free effort free exercise . . going catch . they're going thing . n't anticipate . 's part , friction present making conversion . fair enough . one last question 'll call , given 've almost close 1 o'clock . one client -- one question google cloud platform even running 's completely irrelevant view ? anurag rana carl olofsonoh , . n't think 's relevant . google course late-comer term presenting cloud platform considered suitable enterprise data management -- think spanner new product build formulated opinion . white paper look good . see real customer case -- know interpret , 're going everything . think deployment new application initially least google cloud platform , number vendor good relationship google committed gcp support . also thing bear mind gcp everybody comfortable idea totally committing say aws azure . like third choice maybe people distribute resource across platform simply order give little ï¬‚exibility , feel like 're completely dependent one vendor 're putting egg one basket . fair enough . carl , always pleasure talking . bunch question try take oï¬ „ ine get back . , thank much look forward talking . 're welcome appreciate everyone 's attention time attending event . thanks .
