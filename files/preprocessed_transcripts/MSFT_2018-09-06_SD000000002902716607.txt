'' try actually help customer fairly consultative way , unpack actually mean pragmatically . whilst 2 really alike , kind sort think 4 pillar . first employee empowerment . 're going really digital company , people work digital world . great example work 've done carlsberg brewery . think diversity workforce brewery , everybody -- like folk driving truck delivering beer bar people phd yeast science . -- known could get phd beer , probably would picked different path . seriousness , folk n't find commonality often . putting mobile technology hand people drive truck , connecting microsoft team product everything marketing department yeast science team , actually help product evolution empowering employee . 've done work sort say , `` well hey , would launch new product new market based data coming empowered employee set ? '' ran experiment said , `` hi . listen , think ought -- ought take russian pilsner , remarket launch sãƒæ ’ ã‚â£o paulo , brazil matching customer data , customer sensibility well tasting preference coming yeast data , '' almost blasphemy . 're like , `` 'm going sell russian beer sãƒæ ’ ã‚â£o paulo . talking ?

's strength massive fortune 500 relationship walmart adobe ford telstra e & . mean , name . fortune 500 , across every industry , people betting azure . see 'd say , `` well okay . ? '' sure , really good relationship folk . come couple thing really . come : one , ï¬‚exibility offering . talked edge cloud . 've hybrid hybrid cool . platform enable completely heterogeneous . whether want use microsoft asset open-source asset , on-prem , want cloud , offer common platform developer build product left right . security fabric 's part well enables customer quickly latch whatever local security , data privacy , sovereignty regulatory concern might market operate . platform , hybrid capability within , huge differentiator . second big differentiator u trust . spent lot time investing super clear customer data data , 's data ; ip ip , 's ip . addition , even patent portfolio something extend customer 're looking digitize business .

'd say 3 thing , business model , trust factor , hybrid capability within platform , biggest driver 're growing twice speed market right . got . hybrid side . mentioned 've hybrid hybrid cool . azure key asset hybrid strategy . could talk customer hybrid adoption ? guess , specifically , give u update azure stack . know 's fairly early product -- year . product ? yes . 're super pleased azure stack right . 're taking order threshold ability deliver point . 're pleased . we're also pleased 're going azure sphere . think notion , edge cloud , especially onset 5g coming , mean , really basically put compute everywhere , furthest edge midpoint aggregate way public cloud . deep investment 've made space , common framework identity management , common data platform , common security model , common development model , mean , even google us v code inside environment tool rich supporting devops scenario . platform built ground hybrid mind . think , 's really going take , , especially 5g . 're hack right customer -- well , german auto manufacturer , whereby 're taking -- edge autonomous semiautonomous vehicle , 're taking imagery , course , navigation accident avoidance . ai service running edge car , basically de-identifying facial recognition gdpr requirement . think elaborate elegance compute model edge ability say , `` well okay , want run - - running car ? want running type cellular endpoint telco provider ? want running public cloud ? oh , way , changed mind ? '' mean , azure platform really thing deliver regard today . see huge growth . 's financial aspect . stepped forward pretty aggressively said , `` anything use hybrid capacity , whether window server , sql server , core on-premises software asset , pay . '' scenario described , rather paying 3 time , paying . project competition would , q - walter h pritchard - judson althoff q - walter h pritchard q - unidentified participantwe 're like 80 % le term total expense . technology inherently designed superior way . cost structure dramatically lower . great . got , got . 'm going go one topic . 'll take microphone around . , keep going 's question . judson , oï¬ƒce side , think 've seen -- business around long time . economy good right . think 's driving corporate c growth . 've also done thing product , moved oï¬ƒce 365. 're adding lot value 's cloud hosted . could help maybe unpack little bit growth driver azure oï¬ƒce macro plus product side driver ? yes . well -- 's really interesting traditional pc market , course , lot pressure . yet , oï¬ƒce growing double digit 5 straight quarter . think biggest reason heterogeneous way 've enabled microsoft experience endpoint . 100 million active user oï¬ƒce 365 product io android . growth really tied form factor pc much human experience . 's also done great thing u term expanding creativity collaboration software asset . microsoft team really fire right . 200,000 entity use microsoft team already . -- 1.5 year ' time , paid user microsoft team slack . sort invented notion team tribe collaboration . part good old oï¬ƒce product sort grew loved infused right team 's fabric . collaboration super easy . notion microsoft 365 offering encapsulates oï¬ƒce 365 , window 10 enterprise mobility suite , everything basically take mobile device , huge u suite driver much value customer . independent offering strong growth . oï¬ƒce cloud grew 29 % year-over-year . window 10 700 million device . em , described , basis growth mobile side well identity fabric security fabric cut across really strong u . feed well dynamic , dynamic business application product . 've strongest year 've ever dynamic . dynamic cloud grew 61 % year-over-year . large enterprise customer taking dynamic instead salesforce huge , american airline , walmart , nedbank , adobe , hp , lenovo . 're seeing huge enterprise strength . 's weave together microsoft 365 productivity environment dynamic 365 environment , 're reasoning graph data , , help employee productive . 's good u . got , got . 'm going pause second , see 's question . microphone . okay . right front . 's ... - judson althoff q - walter h pritchard - judson althoffjust broad question medium- , long-term sort view profitability commercial cloud operation . margin sort trending transition on-prem cloud . feel like might towards level margin could start trend . wondered whether could qualitatively give u color . related dynamic , mentioned 's still small business microsoft 's aspiration ? sort ( , given ) level , think could get -- 's still small contributor relative oï¬ƒce business 've got ? yes , okay . maybe -- n't cfo stage margin question . . 2 1 , yes . mean , asked -- qualitatively , tell . quantitatively , 's amy answer . qualitatively , tell margin continuously improving shared nature state growth trajectory . mean , enter new market , enter new market -- say market . whether 're talking platform business competitor aws google productivity realm lead business application realm 're challenger well , enter market 's share gain , margin pressure . growth share trajectory improves , dramatically , 3 realm , we're growing faster market , ability command higher margin also improving . think 'll see good improvement . amy give detail . business application side , term see business growing , 's interesting . way look dynamic look , sure , discrete business . also knock-on effect , , business . take , example , work adobe sap . beauty dynamic n't actually rip replace existing crm erp environment effectively leverage implement fairly nimble business process top existing application environment . may bid given situation dynamic 365 , along adobe , along sap . may win certain component offering . 's 's driving lot growth . drag behind massive growth azure data behind . azure well linkedin asset benefit hugely dynamic even dynamic huge driver . case , actually -- like said , healthy growth . think customer tiring expense related salesforce . salesforce great solution . 's good folk running company . 's expensive . customer n't seeing incremental value want charge incremental increase subscription cost 're placing . 're lot heavy-lifting migration work dynamic 365 's much lower-cost environment . 's much open environment . mean , 's sort proof pudding integration work adobe sap . q - walter h pritchard q - unidentified participant - judson althoff q - walter h pritchard - judson althoff q - walter h pritchard q - unidentified participant - judson althoff others ? -- one . giving hybrid sale example , said , `` 're charging customer 3 time . 're charging . '' presumably , price charge somewhere 3 -- total price 3 separate instance application versus one . n't -- 're giving away 2 , capturing value 's reï¬‚ected one price ? charging lowest price ? well -- strictly speaking , 'll unpack little bit pragmatically . sql server license microsoft currently running on-premises server want take workload cloud run sql cloud , either amazon google , relicense platform . azure . -- 's free already asset . make sense ? pay azure would -- part answer pay since 're buying azure ? yes , right . question ? one . good question . 'll keep going . michael ? think see growth azure . think 's also still lingering concern , end day , 's declining business race 0 pricing . speak state ? yes , sure . think aspect cloud platform market commodity business race 0. look strictly infrastructure-as-a- service storage -- compute storage , yes , chase bottom may best price win . couple thing though even realm , think , lead advantage u . think pure r & thing compute realm quantum computing cryogenic computing , data center 're putting ocean ï¬‚oor , actually give u competitive advantage term cog related even pure infrastructure q - walter h pritchard - judson althoff q - walter h pritchardand storage . actually feel pretty good even worst part business . part u though think lead long-term differentiation , , pricing power market platform service 're offering . take example cosmos db . cosmos db -- really planet-scale database market . run every azure instance . eventually able run every azure stack azure sphere incarnation well . 'll able put -- 'll able decide customer want data reason . basically conquer sort speed-of-light issue singular-instance cloud platform database would . addition , 100 % open . 've invested anti-standard sql cassandra mongo term big data interface key value interface , effectively move code singularity without re-platform work . 's huge differentiation offer kind operational data environment , kind ai sensing environment . cognitive service we're delivering market library service materially greater competition . platform service , isv portfolio , ip deliver 's vertically differentiated provide u pricing power cloud platform . others ? couple good follow-up azure ic side . guess wanted ask follow-up oï¬ƒce pbp side . e5 sort higher-level , expensive skus oï¬ƒce good driver . could talk -- 's security . 's data analytics . 's number different -- 's telephony , different sort avenue customer pursue get e5 . seeing term e5 adoption ? driver sort today versus initially ? yes . feel great e5 right . 's interesting . # 1 driver security , followed closely behind analytics power bi . really feel good competing tableau power bi . fact , 're replacing left right . customer effectively buy suite e5 say , `` well gosh , get security benefit advanced threat protection window estate , mobile device heterogenous endpoint protection core oï¬ƒce 365 tenet . addition , get effectively power bi along also effectively team , '' 're taking skype convergence , value immense . 's huge driver u . stand-alone skus actually also incredibly well people look either , `` well okay , 'll make investment suite roll left right '' 'll say , `` well look , 'll start -- security problem biggest one . 'm going start security asset move rest suite time . '' 's strong . 're bullish continuing growth right sort share within total base customer e5 still relatively small . growth opportunity quite large . - judson althoff q - walter h pritchard - judson althoff q - walter h pritchardgot . maybe diving little bit . get question lot investor , microsoft side well cover security space . security massive market . 've got ten billion dollar . microsoft sort played little bit market . 's lot money spent customer adding something exchange oï¬ƒce 365 secure . pc . 've got authentication solution . people sort folding active directory forth . 's sort higher-level strategy microsoft around security ? view revenue opportunity given seat sale side ? yes . 's good question . -- security one market , pointed , -- take approach , like one want kind mop sort niche vendor space , 'll long time number vendor every company security offering enormous , multiple dozen average . seek provide common platform security . first , starting asset . want secure oï¬ƒce 365 , want secure window estate , best way security offering . lowest-cost way offering , effectively , 's like prego spaghetti sauce thing . 's , right ? sort take next leap extension , say , well , also leverage active directory azure active directory cloud identity multifactor authentication mobile endpoint . want inclusive offering portfolio . effectively , 's security get within microsoft 365. security model identity graph ï¬‚ows dynamic 365. 's available asset azure . 're writing bespoke application , 're using isv 's top platform , seek dramatically lower cost anything related portfolio effectively . always additional value-add largely consultancy help customer cyberattack scenario kind thing . 's really core business . lot partner leverage regard sort build stack . consolidation market ? yes . ever point like , `` hi . look 's 2 3 vendor . get everything need one ? '' n't think . got , got . well think , 're going close . see 18 second clock . thank , everybody . judson , thank much coming . appreciate . thank much . thanks time . yes . .
