okay . welcome , everybody , nvidia presentation . 'm han . cover semiconductor . chris evenden u , senior director investor relation . 're going fireside chat feel free ask question . 's going breakout afterwards -- ( caraba ) ? ( corova ) ? ( cordoba ) . okay , go . okay , chris , welcome . let 's start . 're graphic company . 're changing . , least historically , 've graphic company . give u update 's happening core gpu business . resilient pc market 's kind weak past couple year ? okay . fundamentally , 're visual computing company . product make , say , graphic processing unit . couple way making money technology . one building gpu selling number market . think one 're referring geforce market , consumer graphic market . think best way think -- one 's surprising lot ( inaudible ) year , ( inaudible ) 's really well . ( inaudible ) pc market , ( inaudible ) . two market compete ( inaudible ) oem gaming . gaming market actually healthy . pc gaming well . estimate market 's growing around 10 % year . , 're growing within . think 've gained little bit share year year . contrast , oem market , tied mainstream consumer notebook , largely , weak market . , obviously , 's decline . strength han mosesmann chris evenden han mosesmann chris evenden han mosesmanngaming market outweighs . 've shown quite lot strength last 12 month . okay . -- working ? everybody -- everybody hear ? -- 'll shout . well n't use ? staying topic gpu , game console -- 's series new game console come . impact potentially impact geforce business ? sure . intuitively , 'd think 'd impact geforce share wallet argument , right ? 's much money consumer spend gaming . pc gamers , typically , one console . game lot device . however , n't seen . mean , really , really strong q4 . impacted q4 , q4 would wonderful without . n't -- n't appear seeing weakness due new console launching . reason ? lot good game coming pc . look like pattern seems set continue . one interesting thing new console , architecturally speaking , essentially pc . although gaming pc scale , 're sort right bottom end gaming pc . 're . think make lot easier -- easier , mean cheaper -- software developer , game developer , port game across pc console . mean see game available quickly pc , good gaming , people n't buy gpus want buy gpu , buy gpu want play game experience game better , high resolution , special effect , whatever , what-have-you . okay . staying gpu side thing , 've recently disclosed past year 're thinking licensing technology . work ? 's timing ? would customer . ? chris evenden han mosesmann chris evenden han mosesmann chris evenden han mosesmann chris evenden han mosesmann -- 's two way license technology . 's licensing graphic core taking -- providing something value customer . 're also enforcing ip , ip right , intellectual property right , well . , really , 're focused former . would use latter came . 're much focused licensing core people . would people building socs phone market , conceivably , even inside market . example , smart tv . smart tv interesting market obviously us sort -- need sort technology provide . whenever 've looked market , n't able make financial case building chip specifically market . however , go tv manufacturer 's already building chip say , 's world 's best gpu , video encoder , block , would conceivably market . phone manufacturer adjacent business . timing ? timing -- 're conversation people . 's nothing report 's something report challenge . 's something say 78 % complete . 's -- ? , say han . last time ever fireside chat . 're coming back ( inaudible ) . yes . always . chris evenden han mosesmann chris evenden han mosesmannokay . 's diﬃcult -- 've actually signed deal , n't got signed deal , think nutshell . okay . set next question get lot investor , arrangement intel , cross-licensing agreement . 's second agreement . end 2016-2017. concern investor $ 60 million get per quarter intel , net , go away . go zero . explain put take potential new agreement . would happen would ? 's right . licensing agreement originally signed 2004. updated 2010 , 2009. run march 2017. cover patent march 2017 perpetuity . intel right patent perpetuity , , way , . right intel 's patent period perpetuity , well , important point . . mean april 1st , 2017 , 's nothing u -- intel right patent . 's situation start rectifying fairly quickly , file around 500 1,000 patent every year . , 'll see think right strategic approach take towards whether want renew agreement , want renew , think value going forward . bear case 's zero probability u renewing agreement intel 's 100 % probability one else sign sort licensing agreement u meantime . think truth n't black white . truth going somewhere . somewhere licensing revenue . get closer , 'll able report -- actually sign deal , 'll able report . get closer march 2017 , , yes , 'll able talk intel go . right . go tegra , exciting stuff , question audience ? q - unidentified participant q - han mosesmann q - unidentified participant q - han mosesmann - chris evenden q - han mosesmannquestions answer ( technical diﬃculty ) . repeat question , 've recently stabilized pricing raised price ? yes . 're supposed going . n't . okay , yes . interesting statement price supposed going . mean , one beautiful thing gpu market price going . would say last 12 month price actually gone . 's largely mix thing , , mentioned , gaming strong oem weak . , blended asp actually going . within -- even within gaming , asp least ﬂat . 'd look data sure . think 's least ﬂat . absolutely , strong competitive position . amd launched range new card . launched couple new one . 've re-jigged lineup . 're start launching new set . launched first maxwell generation architecture , well . feel pretty good competitive position . look back market share number last three year , 've somewhere 58 % 66 % market share entire time . 's moved around bit . 's relatively stable . would expect continue . one caution around market share number , though , unit share number . 's dollar share number . , mean 's dominated high- volume , low-asp , low-gross-margin-percentage oem sale . , see fairly significant shift % market share , unit market share , without actually seeing much change revenue . , course , even le change profit share . fact , one quarter last year unit share went , according mercury number . dollar share clearly went continued perform well high end . - chris evenden q - han mosesmann - chris evendenany question ? right . let 's go tegra . tegra -- average tech analyst mixed emotion tegra term tegra 1 , tegra 2 , tegra 3 , lofty goal 's reasonable goal . 've able incorporate modem functionality new tegras , icera modem . yes . give update tegra . tablet , going smartphones , deemphasizing smartphones 'll going area , automotive , example ? give u rundown . stole thunder . tegra intersection visual computing android . basic strategy believe android verge becoming ubiquitous . wherever visual computing , wherever visual experience matter android , 's believe successful tegra . might high-end smart phone , super phone . might tablet , automotive , set-top box gaming device , la apple tv , sort product . right , 've launched new tegra chip , call tegra k1 . first chip 've launched pc-class gpu . , 're worried power consumption say . power consumption fit within envelope smartphone . function 'd expect pc graphic chip , opengl 4.4 , directx 11. . also cuda programmable core , well . general purpose compute gpu . , enables , example , regard gaming , unreal engine 4 ported across new chip . mean make -- unreal engine middleware game . make -- 's essentially programming language game . write game top unreal engine . make , easy , trivial almost , port game one platform another 're running unreal engine . think unreal engine probably popular aaa -- game engine aaa title . gear war , example , written previous version unreal engine . demo actually used ce show tegra , tegra k1 , one ran -- one written ps4 . one written pc . ported straight across written unreal engine platform . q - han mosesmann - chris evenden q - han mosesmann - chris evenden q - han mosesmann - chris evendenthe thing showed ce 64-bit version tegra k1 . think we're first company -- think , still , company -- demonstrated android running 64-bit chip far . 'll see device based back half year . 'll see device based 32-bit version tegra k1 first half year . mobile world congress last week , showed tegra 4i , two tegra 4i phone . -- 4i integrated application processor plus baseband . 'll see . lte baseband . multi-mode lte , yes . 2g , 3g , 4g , lte . 's really . 're taking -- going pc space , running game , 're saying android 'll able play pc game compete basically ultrabook-class intel amd-based platform ? yes . `` compete '' strong word . n't know 'll actually compete . 'll certainly able build android chrome device much computing graphic power device . tegra k1 , think , powerful xbox 360 ps3 . last generation console . 'll able gaming experience , user experience , level quality . n't think 've got benchmark compare directly current integrated platform . n't comment . suspect gpu powerful integrated platform available x86 side fence today . going back tegra tegra 4i . , 's strategy ? 're seeing number new player mediatek marvell broadcom even intel want joint lte modem integrated soc party sole kind party qualcomm past couple year . 're another guy . 's differentiation ? 's strategy ? differentiation come back visual experience . gaming visual computing general . 're right 's lot talk lte modem . think 's really artifact fact 's one player modem moment . q - han mosesmann - chris evendenand , two year hence , 'll bunch people perfectly competent lte modem . 'll one , obviously . point , wo n't think twice modem . wo n't lot conversation mode , conversation wifi chip pc , right ? 'll another piece equipment . , 'll modem better modem . 'll , probably good enough . 'll probably diﬃcult average consumer , downright impossible , average consumer differentiate modem . point , conversation go back application processor . change user experience . think combination graphic technology . software , ecosystem , 've built around , differentiate give consumer differentiated experience , whereas someone 's relying modem , solely modem , wo n't able differentiate way , modem pretty good . question tegra chris ? right . 'll move quadro , workstation , professional solution business . tesla , high-performance computer supercomputer . portion business 20 % -plus sale . , high gross margin , sticky . tell u explain layman 's term business transition grid ? grid ? street trying figure big , . kind stuff . grid . n't know 'll transition grid . think grid separate . quadro graphic , professional graphic . principally cad workstation . also special effect oscar , composed quadro video editing , sort thing , professional user . tesla something different . 's using gpu . -- graphic . compute . 're actually performing mathematical calculation . -- number application map well , parallelize well . weather simulation might one . black-scholes equation , modeling derivative , another one , actually , map well . grid putting gpu cloud making graphic performance available network . graphic running remotely . , three different business . want talk 're -- let 's talk grid . grid -- main focus right -- 's number way monetize technology . 've managed virtualize gpu put network , 's number way make money . q - han mosesmann - chris evenden q - han mosesmann - chris evenden q - han mosesmann q - unidentified participant q - han mosesmanngaming 're looking -- 6,000-person beta streaming gaming running northern california right . main focus today improving user experience citrix vmware user . -- two -- adding gpu virtual desktop infrastructure 's used citrix vmware , improve user experience average user . also enable new application , 3d application , n't previously supported citrix , xendesktop vmware . today stage hundred trial worldwide running . number trial increasing rapidly . 's , think , 40 % q-on-q . 're point yet talk revenue , 's enterprise . purchase cycle two year . 've around six month . end year , would expect u better idea conversion rate trial . average deal size , data exists yet . right . end year , would start -- would expect start see convert production system . 's tam , roughly speaking ? tam question always challenging , right , look ( inaudible ) . 's billion , believe . 'll probably another look analyst day , -- 'll get plug analyst day -- march 25th . three week away , three week tomorrow . billion 'd say . 's -- moment , 're single-digit million revenue . 're somewhere away . right , ( ted ) , come . ( inaudible ) keep talking financial software like addition model ( inaudible ) . - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evendencan repeat question ? yes , sure . asked , , potential software licensing part grid business . would fairly way , fairly typical business model enterprise market . , truth told , updating software regularly stay date latest application enterprise user running . absolutely , 's possibility . 's -- 're -- 's early discus exactly business model . obviously , 're discussion potential customer right run trial . quite happily , new cfo actually background . 's anyone help u figure right business model market , 's . question share buyback . give u update , would wait analyst day ? asked share buyback . , last year returned $ 1 billion shareholder . year said 'd return $ 1 billion . $ 160 million dividend , roughly , assuming stay current level . leaf $ 840 million share repurchase . announced $ 500 million asr february . ( inaudible ) . 's actually asr 's executing . authorization north $ 1 billion . forget exactly . think 's $ 1.3 billion . $ 500 million executing . run june . , think -- think asr last major buyback . feel like 's right way go . mean , company terrible deciding buy stock . spread risk period time asr , actually get discount volume-weighted average price time . get 60 % share front . theory , everyone win . win get take risk equation . investor win lot share taken table front . whoever executes asr assumes generate profit trade . q - han mosesmann - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evenden another question . yes . 're going license ( inaudible ) technology board manufacturer . use ( inaudible ) , , -- competitive advantage ( inaudible ) ? 's -- , question , reinterpret question , , start licensing gpu technology , n't compete tegra , essentially , right ? that's 're saying ? n't think , oddly enough . reason 's ideological decision whether build chip . maybe ﬂattering way put , 's strategic choice company make . make choice based -- n't know -- special knowledge matter . imagine apple n't decide -- n't sit around table look detailed strategic choice . -- idea probably sprung fully-formed steve job 's head build chip control aspect , example . right ? way , actually , licensing technology open market , there'll still emergent semiconductor market compete . there'll market compete . use example without implying one thing whether 're , look samsung , example , chip . -- buy chip company like . n't think 're going change either two strategy . 's way forward . started licensing technology , way could compete samsung business tegra . percentage device , device . , licensing technology , compete device . like said , example illustration purpose . give idea think whole market -- market whole . q - han mosesmann - chris evenden q - han mosesmann - chris evenden q - han mosesmann - chris evenden yes . oems made decision include intel , apple , samsung , give sense 've made decision make socs . license graphic technology arm imagination , right ? question tegra , go another topic ? okay . chris , moore 's law slowing . 're using tsmc . 's transition going tsmc kind go finfet . 're going 28-nanometer 20- nanometer 16-nanometer finfet . road -- intel 's offering foundry service . lot issue going . committed tsmc ? would consider going intel , intel basically said , 'll talk anybody , including competitor ? tsmc best short answer . -- 'd fool think looking supplier . . send -- send test chip foundry every . find point technology business term right , think would put chip foundry . reality , date , tsmc extremely good . anyone match . right 're committed . anything left ? think left automotive . 'm going go . anything specific think -- ? well n't talk tesla . 'm excited tesla . right , let 's talk tesla . like talk tesla . tesla 's interesting business . tesla using gpu . compute . frustrating ir guy , clearly much excitement around tesla . 'd see many really interesting application . stuck sort $ 25 million quarter couple year , actually . 's recently burst limit . think 's couple -- 's two reason . think one enough code supported . q - han mosesmann q - unidentified participant - chris evenden q - unidentified participant - chris evendenare like numerical sub-routines common many application supported tesla . enough channel term company like cray , ibm , nec , supermicro , take market . whereas year half ago , sell tesla company would actually go company . 'd evangelize parallel programming company . 'd help code porting . 'd make sale . conceive situation researcher drug company looking protein interaction , say , know molecular dynamic code accelerated tesla . know ibm sell tesla server . phone ibm salesman get one delivered friday . -- , business scale . , 's 're seeing . business scaled . grew 37 % year year last year . 's reason optimism , 're looking additional market like consumer internet -- big data analytics consumer internet company . 's proving quite rich seam mine , well . 's -- , tesla still relatively small part revenue . hinted earlier , 's extremely profitable . lot fall bottom line . think people underestimate impact eps business . ted ? quick one . seen uptick hyperscale web 2.0 company adopting tesla ? seen uptick hyperscale web 2.0 company -- ? ( inaudible ) . amazon us tesla aws . 's fairly focused application right . company , like say , consumer internet company making pretty interesting use tesla , smaller larger scale . bunch example . steal analyst day . wo n't . 's bunch . q - han mosesmann - chris evenden q - han mosesmann okay , minute . graphic company get sticky relationship european car company series car company , incumbent decade ? 's really interesting , actually . think 's growth -- keep going back visual computing , like pr automaton . visual computing . look make difference car experience , quality net . got originally nav dvd playback . quality varies lot . barcelona last week . cab priuses . , one version digital dashboard . actually -- lucky enough drive friend 's tesla motor car couple week ago . another version digital dashboard . quality pixel quite startlingly different . tesla honda dashboard , could n't dream charging $ 100,000 , right ? -- increasingly , experience car metered in-car electronics . quality graphic , speed update nav , resolution display , realism dial -- increasingly 're seeing all-digital cockpit , physical needle dial . 's one element . element 's going really interesting going forward gpu good taking data turning image , gpu also good taking image pulling data . image recognition , example . 's going important car company move towards ada , advanced driver automation system . -- show tegra k1 taking real-time video feed front car , recognizing white line , even reading road sign , speed limit sign side road , figuring far front car . , car company move towards ada system , , powerful u . audi announce using tegra k1 ada system . they've shown really interesting demo , example , car -- manages stop-start traﬃc . move car front stop , move car front stop , keep pulling forward . also stay white line . steer , well . feature like audi think going car end decade . 's really , , power gpu , real , quote , real gpu , really help u . - chris evendenchris , thank much . thank , everybody . thank .
