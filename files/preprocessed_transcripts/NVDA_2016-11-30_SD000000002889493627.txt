perfect . n't go ahead get started , 'd like welcome everyone afternoon session . name john pitzer , 'm semiconductor analyst credit suisse . 's distinct pleasure afternoon introduce colette kress , evp cfo nvidia corporation . 're going go fireside chat next 20 25 minute . microphone circulating throughout room . guy bashful crowd today -- conference today . question , raise hand , 'll make sure get mic . colette , let start thing , guess 's lot people room n't somewhat familiar nvidia story . 's always helpful room like , case someone little bit le familiar spend minute position company . 's core ip , core end market try attack , core strategy . guess importantly , talk little bit thing beyond chip level software ecosystem ( inaudible ) really distinguishes lot semiconductor company . yes , think 's good place start . company founded leader visual computing . work key part transformation , started four five year ago , really focusing gpu computing company mean new gpu computing company . , looking place , gpu , standing graphic processing unit could leveraged component platform . main component big factor obviously pc platform probably key important application time gaming . moving towards . 've transformed company , john pitzer colette kressfocused key market felt tremendous growth potential front extremely hard problem solve . gpu would leveraged ever uniquely platform . moving away component . platform incorporating key gpu also development infrastructure platform incorporates development language many time key design capability , library framework used market . core market today gaming . 's still significant portion business , represents 55 % business . also pro visualization , essentially taking graphic processing capability enterprise application . third one data center , many different part , 'll talk also automotive business . term automotive today , focused infotainment , 're using computing graphic inside center console . moving future strategy self-driving car overall ai platform 's going necessary car going forward . four market . put u unique position ability unified architecture essentially product one market allows u leverage essentially invest four market one significant amount operating expense . probably engineer planet singularly focused gpu company . business going well strategy really allowed u expand market probably 10x even three four year ago . 's helpful start . kind want drill one four business segment growth driver . gaming probably good place start 's still sort largest four business 're , said 55 % revenue . business 've able grow compound annual growth rate last five year 20 % little bit greater 20 % . , know tied new pc sale . period time pc almost 30 % peak . talk little bit driver helping keep cagr specifically asp biggest driver , probably better asp growth unit growth driving cagr time . sure . let kind talk gaming market . gaming market , primarily u focused pc . yes . overall pc market enormous , 300 million . necessarily growth business . sell actual gaming platform underneath pc platform . rarely , sale term gpu market associated pc . normal , people pc essentially opening change overall experience gaming inserting new gpu business . overall business focused providing gaming platform every type gamer . think many type platform gaming , get one choice . think u , 've got $ 100 , 've got $ 1000 , something sell overall experience . allows u really fine-tune working software developer game developer better better game , game essentially change based kind gpu actually . success last three year , half year ago , calculated overall cagr 30 % historically , much faster overall pc market literally driver inﬂuencing , unit growth also asp growth . half half [ ph ] coming . , unit overall growing sensitive pc platform gaming today pc platform playing greatest game , 's social sport . people sitting alone , playing pong back forth , 're actually friend online . friend side bar , friend watching game , watching professional play . like sport , 's essentially sport term gaming . esports got people online , watching others tournament . think wealth video youtube focus play game . 's enormous business 's extremely healthy . people get appropriate gearing [ ph ] essentially gamers joining two two , necessarily one one term social . see expansion broadband access across world . think everybody broadband capability u . continues grow . look western world many sister country . want onboard overall gaming population . continue see grow . gamers continue gamers longer period time . 40 year old still gaming , discretionary income buy whatever need overall gaming experience . second , come actual game . game 're playing online multi-player type game , multi- strategic type game going volume volume , franchise around ten year , 15 year 're version 5 , version 6. complicated game , complicated see overall graphic capability rendering going necessary different scenario . additional production value game , need higher-end gpus . go second piece 're seeing , higher asp . 's case price increase , 's case people buying need type game want play . buying higher-end gpus . average , selling higher price point term [ ph ] . fortunate piece 're right , launched recent pascal architecture , also big inﬂuence , probably one largest increase term performance last generation see pascal . mean gamers ' performance per dollar tremendously higher . 's great john pitzer colette kressopportunity buy . exited [ ph ] market last four five month six , seven different type gaming card unavailable great thing essentially anything $ 200 price point , get buy nvidia 's 's available . 's going well . last quarter , 60 % growth overall gaming business 're initial stage holiday season . one question got october quarter think channel , transition maxwell pascal , asp basis kind channel fill basis clearly waterfall new product assuming high asp product kind first market , october quarter probably benefited . move january quarter , get volume . guess rich -- mix kind becomes little bit le rich pascal side . think channel fill sort mix next couple quarter move maxwell pascal ? sure . line 've come , whether would kepler , whether would maxwell , last generation pascal , we've continued keep customer toe term 's coming first . 've concentrated , given exact architecture across , opportunity see market different way feel -- benefit market . one said , hey , want first different type channel fill want concentrate little bit actual channel . channel extremely important u . partner enable u deal 're term building best architecture , 're term managing day-to-day term channel . great relationship working back forth understanding demand , believe demand well 're seeing locally , grow growth [ ph ] 's really factor every single region growing , every zip code growing , every card 've term growing . channel fill ( inaudible ) number platform approach , designed set key driver software every gaming card go , see light , geforce experience experience allows latest driver next game come . want online gaming second . see game 're playing , see type card overall buying . 's case channel fill also see light geforce experience , help u concentrate excitement market gaming going forward . growth seen seamless execution moving maxwell build term pascal . know n't talk lot . 's lot 20 year hard work make sure manage , effectively channel partner john pitzer colette kress john pitzer colette kress john pitzercan see nicely end maxwell beginning pascal . say pascal one largest performance improvement 've seen generation generation , replace asp improvement well two thing kind track hand hand ? think 're early stage pascal . 're probably four , four half month 're seeing term sale . think 's little bit early say , seen significant improvement saw term maxwell generation . yes , average asp far driver growth , factor -- large factor growth well . another element driving gaming business october quarter albeit smaller tegra side business nintendo switch . think kind initial build think modeling next three four quarter ? yes . relationship nintendo pleased . opportunity meet key specification inside console . much love overall console market , focused high-performance . focused relationship appreciate underlying value gpus put case soc . number two , really important u work relationship , know semi-custom need engineer 100 % focused making sure nintendo 's product great . done working time ready upcoming launch . number three , business model important u appreciated value producing could win-win situation nintendo well nvidia . ca n't announce number 's nintendo 's great product , 's great product , look really cool hope greater success . yes , working ceding socs upcoming launch . question get gaming growth perspective longer term impact ar vr . 'm kind curious perspective , guy look separate sub-category within gaming look application continues along path higher asp time ? colette kress john pitzer colette kress correct . think would look ar vr essentially next generation gaming . gaming today two dimensional , overall screen . move importance virtual reality . thought 's getting realistic . take different character term stand within game . hard work done many year improve overall technical capability allow vr ar . need need performance , ability render speed pleasant experience virtual reality . think 're early stage virtual reality . 've gotten point great experience opportunity increase overall content underlying hardware capable , well probably improve overall form factor vr hand many . focused platform enabling vr couple way . 'll see almost pascal card come essentially vr ready . know likelihood , 're going come buy card , 's going factor mind say , wait , buying able vr later point . n't mean 're going spending 100 % time vr . even 're going spend 10 % 20 % time new game vr old , want ready 's factor type card believe 're choosing today . , 's separate category . think extension next wave gaming go . last question gaming front competitive side . guy done great job last several year , taking share marketplace . see amd , largest competitor coming back market year polaris . 've done roadmap vega next year . look third-party data , actually unit basis took share back earlier year ; hard find dollar basis profit basis . think competitive market amd coming back new product ? amd nvidia two firm together quite time . however took different approach , probably five year ago . component inside type pc . taken hold determining end customer , gamer looking use oems help u see market . right , think established high performance level think type gaming people want . think 're initially seeing well received . think 've got way go . think 're excited running around track somebody else . think make run harder . think 's fun . john pitzer colette kress perfect , switching gear data center . 10 % 15 % business today , tremendous growth story . go back last three year , 've gone $ 200 million annual run rate $ 1 billion annual run rate . help audience sort understand extent driven better penetration within supercomputer hpc market versus new workload especially around ai ? think 's good u kind introduce 's data center business . seems -- kind simple talk . 's actually quite bit complexity different area . exactly five different market -- inside data center business . spoke overall high- performance computing market , area 've focused 10 12 different year term growing business . area , mathematical computation need completed well known . using accelerator gpu , taking workload cpu travel gpu speed workload . think many large data center would benefit getting work done faster . largest supercomputer world top 10 application high-performance computing using accelerated computing using gpus . continues important growth market u growing quite well . expanded u market . second one talk actually grid , virtualization . case , want leverage vdi environment , use gpu . instead one-to-one relationship overall pc , 've one-to-many gpu cloud environment , 're interested streaming application , streaming overall compute , capability software layer virtualize gpu experience . make approximately 10 % 15 % business space . 've working tremendously citrix vmware others continue build market significantly improve user interface . break rest , really fastest growing piece 's three type area artificial intelligence . first started many year working many high-end hyperscale’s around world . , would hyperscale’s focused ? significant amount data . significant amount data different form factor running network . 're trying u make application provide u work better . thing search , thing term image deduction , thing term video transcoding . type thing important u . 've noticed , search command seems getting smarter . reality 's artificial intelligence behind scene . gpu uniquely john pitzer colette kresspositioned available expand use artificial intelligence framework referred deep learning framework . deep learning framework framework working ( inaudible ) allowed take significant hundred million data point infer answer . different high-performance computing , know answer ? significant amount data , actual accuracy information better . hyperscale’s moving speak phone , better battery performance term translating information returning back millisecond term need term response . work gone application application , workload workload hyperscale’s . we've continued advance almost every single hyperscale’s planet term working environment ai . number two , hyperscale’s also working availability ai mass . know , evolution cloud computing importance able go online get cloud instance , one generated gpu behind . whether use gpu computing , researcher wanting ai go aws , microsoft , google others overall . 's another key growth area ai . number three , continue expand different industry . extend many part enterprise . process large set data , buy supercomputer , ai supercomputer u called dgx-1 . come eight gpus , come fully enclosed storage , memory well development layer software layer . plug get started term ai . five different business term data center . drilling ai , think one thing everyone room struggling trying quantify market opportunity time . couple question along factor . first , think ai gpu versus fpga versus asic accelerator . feel gpu suitable ip attract entire ai market . think architectural difference using gpu , fpga asic ai computation ? sure . uniquely positioned initial continue work artificial intelligence , mainly work done deep learning . creating deepening framework . overall use gpu well positioned overall programmability , openness accepting every single one different framework . ( inaudible ) work . 've continued focus underlying hardware case , remember ai , 're talking significant amount data , significant amount processing john pitzer colette kress john pitzerand significant amount processing need happen time parallel standpoint effective . waiting week information answer come back . could tweak get even better answer overall value-added process . gpu uniquely situated case . different form factor . believe ai computing evolution probably u next 10 year 20 year . many different form factor . n't mean perform type work . one way -- n't know correct . would like get opinion . seems perception two part ai market . training 's inference . training , gpu particularly well suited . 're still early training market . people concerned move inference perhaps n't need high performance chip people move different sort architecture . one 's simplistic two , world move training inference , sort product available 's sort optimized inference market well . think 's good place start . let 's say training , 're exactly seeing anybody use anything else gpu , significant amount performance 's necessary . even move inference , continued set card , chip , whatever 're putting together enable consistency training environment , algorithm overall inferencing process . inferencing going wide broad . inference using refrigerator , using thermostat . probably going small , watered , simple functioning type ai device . 's necessarily something agree would necessarily need gpu . 's 're going concentrate . significant amount benefit 've already seen term inference using gpu term speed term piece confirming overall training environment 've done well . 've already seen u come p4 p40 well . much , much smaller , small size fitting existing architecture , allowing scale , scale providing even energy eﬃcient type use . approach . would n't surprise u different type piece along . going probably sizable market . 'll continue expertise bringing computing platform together . question audience ? q - unidentified participant - john pitzer - colette kress - john pitzer - colette kressquestions answer ( inaudible ) market attacking . application actually ﬂow back intel ? people webcast , question view intel xeon phi nirvana acquisition relative competitive front ? yes . lot different type competition . think 's important note even though may referred fpga versus gpu , . likeness . gpus performance level tremendously different anything seen fpgas around long time well . necessarily growth . n't case know fpgas used deep learning training type environment . actually challenging think designing fpga reconfiguring fpga . intel probably working many different type strategy . see xeon phi , see fpgas , see different acquisition thing referred coming soon . 're focusing today . 're focusing today customer today . 're focused trying determine type hardware know . 're focus infrastructure development work need different market . working ecosystem building library , building top framework assisting speed ai want go 're focused . capability 'm sure . n't seen develop cohesive piece together serve important area see significant today . , run time session . wanted thank colette joining u , really appreciate time . appreciate everyone room coming join u . thank . thank .
