welcome everyone . 'm amy hood , chief financial oﬃcer microsoft , 'm kevin scott , executive vice president ai , chief technology oﬃcer . wanted welcome kevin talk directly investor , given significance next-generation ai , leadership position ai era , wanted spend time talking myriad question 've gotten meeting investor conference call . think help frame growth opportunity ahead , really speaking consider person charge running show . , , let 's jump right . , first question , get asked way , kevin , 'll ask way , listen , 've seen multiple hype cycle tech : crypto , metaverse . transformative next-generation ai really ? question answer multiple hype cycle ai . grad school , called ai winter , 've many boom bust cycle , like wikipedia page describing bust look like . say , like i've machine learning ai work since stopped computer science professor 2003. 've really interesting exponential trajectory 20 year . think 've kind ﬂat part curve 20 year . like really started see inﬂection like starting first 2012 realization finally compute , data needed really extract performance deep neural network . we've seen , remarkable way , 's one reason 've done investment openai , 've built supercomputing infrastructure , able build new category application 're calling co-pilot , model past handful year become behave really like platform . , thing 're training conditioning single use , 're big piece infrastructure build , use across like many , many , many , many thing . , look technology cycle - amy hood - kevin scotthave gone lifetime , 's personal computing , 's internet , 's mobile revolution . think , sort next thing progression evolution technology , really change way build software . way 've talking folk try describe profound actually , 've writing computer program using computing technology way 180 year . ada lovelace wrote first program 180 year ago , 've thing le way since powerful computing device powerful software abstraction . basically , human want get computing device something , either skilled programmer , get skilled programmer anticipate need run program they've written . , ai tool anyone use express thing want accomplish . ﬂexible way , get computer thing . like 're done progression yet term much capable technology going get . interesting one , kevin , , , would say perspective talking customer , 's showing every conversation n't asking hype . 's different . 're asking , hey , listen , quickly based really said make much approachable problem- solving , real problem people every seat organization feel see opportunity . , think 're asking deploy , far , gosh , real thing ? , certainly resonates . given broad sort excitement , investor know ai strategy , differentiates really ? think amount news , sheer news 's come past , feel like long time , 's really three four month . maybe help distill difference plan make different . yeah , mean , think 've strong point view thought ai platform trending past five solid year . like started transformation inside microsoft year even partnership openai . part really believe model becoming platform . believe 're going small handful 're going use foundation software creating . rethought build low-level infrastructure way design deploy data center compute networking look like , way software development environment look like . talked little bit year build , like notion co-pilot stack , distinctive , think , lamp stack beginning internet revolution . -- -- thing say u one line 've investing past five year . reason see - amy hood - kevin scott - amy hood - kevin scott - amy hood - kevin scottthis news 've focused way built platform top application getting built delivered . 's way would 've able produce many copilot application . , microsoft 365 copilot , bing chat , chatgpt . 'm probably going say whole bunch copilot even n't launched let get carried away , 's way would 've able deliver n't real platform underlying . would 've expensive , painful , time-consuming one independent thing . think 's interesting talked , kevin , platform really , 's , 's approach every problem company , people think approach ai incredibly similar . yeah . , thought , would encourage investor go back look build keynote , key aspect 's every layer platform . yeah . built mind . think particular , certain thing really resonated . microsoft fabric example , right ? really resonated broke 's really different . think 's also 's hard sometimes capture large technological transformation happen . think would say , sort generational moment term watching innovation 's showing across world , across company size . think that's probably make exciting particular , think , developer last week . mean , 's certainly changing perspective . always tell people think , oh , platform . well , audience always asks , `` well , revenue show ? '' really come two place , right ? 's tool service customer use , right , build ai apps service . 'll run azure openai apis , 'll run azure infrastructure . point , 's going built every microsoft cloud solution . everyone . , whether announced announced , whether 's named co-pilot , 'll aspect . 'll something show 's ai-enabled . think , 's reason 'll sort next generation ai business fastest growing $ 10 billion business history . think confidence energy 're seeing . - amy hood - kevin scott - amy hood - kevin scottyeah , 100 % , thing , say , really general platform , like lot different way $ 10 billion arr going first show . , like people want come use infrastructure , whether 're training model , whether running open source model 've got , whether making api call one big frontier model 've built openai . 's like product , like slightly different potential business model . , like way going able sort monetize think really interesting . like 'm excited developer even top , 're probably going get business model n't existed history like , 're going business model innovation happening well . 's really hallmark almost big technology shift technical transformation , platform transformation , business model innovation . think , always exciting . lived maybe first transition cloud around , second one , think way , people -- investor ask , `` gosh , 'm worried money take invest . try remind people , company , 're different spot . we're leading cycle . understand run at-scale cloud business . said something really important earlier , 've built single platform ground effectively , 's used consistently every service . 's frankly decade ago , term reusability fungibility . , think , course , 'll see scaled capex 'll cog growth associated , 'll also far better spot started , ability leverage confidence 're feeling customer demand , feel quite optimistic . yeah . mean thing say capex like , 's capex we're deploying feel like 've got go spend catch , like capex 're deploying feel like 's gigantic opportunity ahead u , 's going big return investment capital . yeah . think put head different spot term talking customer see developer . another question get lot investor customer view think really topic read lot ethic , regulation , overall safety come ai really capable share topic work 've already done responsible ai principle ? know one key component think every day scene . yeah , 's one thing think actually another strategic advantage building platform . , think think - amy hood - kevin scottsafety responsibility security system one necessary bit platform . ca n't platform without whole number reason , like maybe starting customer trust . trustworthy platform , trustworthy infrastructure , trustworthy application 're building . 've looking whole discipline responsible ai many year . , think even joined microsoft , satya -- satyacharged bunch people microsoft research legal team building real ai ethic responsible ai practice . investing year everything . need put legal team ? need research ? infrastructure need build help product team make sure test ass system safety responsibility ? one anecdote share press around bing chat , infamous kevin roose article . interesting thing like even deploying , learning much build thing safety responsibility , like believe everything 've launched adhered strictly publicly available responsible ai standard 's second version right . even sort learning use safety system tune thing meet preference expectation user . kevin roose thing basically , wo n't even call fixed , adjusted product within couple hour story breaking . reason able make change quickly safety infrastructure built allowed u make sure change making particular product conform preference user make sure people n't using product way n't intended . stuff built let u assessment make sure fix n't cause problem addressing . think important said , listen , 're waiting regulation take proactive approach responsibility , , think , going process . 've heard also mention regulation needed , 've said company . talk conversation ? well , think look sort technology ubiquitous impact society , 's always regulation . , favorite metaphor electricity . , sort think ai system , think , like hope time similar sort impact 10 year , 15 year , diﬃcult time imagining world could function without . get point , must expect 's going regulation . 'll regulation generation bit . way regulation power generator turbine generation facility , ai . probably regulation distribution electricity , 'll regulation sort endpoint technology , actually get delivered product user touching . n't know exactly regulation look like . brad really brilliant job , think , couple week ago articulating like initial point view . also believe 's going lot debate - amy hood - kevin scott - amy hood - kevin scottand public conversation regulation really need . , , like -- like would really suspicious , honestly , would sign technology maybe n't impactful think believe n't need regulating . yeah , think 's interesting way thinking . thing get asked lot customer focus privacy . think surprise , right , people learn technology , obviously , people clear , -- data belong -- customer data belongs customer like today , applies world ai well . use azure openai example , customer data remains within tenant boundary . llm fine-tuned data , remains data , applied master llm . , think 's important , keep reiterating customer . hearing sort question talk people ? yeah , absolutely . think said like thing make sure everyone really understands . like , 're using people 's data improve foundation model . covenant everyone around data , respect tenant , absolutely respected technology , whether 's openai model something built , like 's - - like super diligent , , 's one thing 're lucky spent past 15 plus year building infrastructure , we've able rely 've deploying new ai technology . absolutely , want move , would say , second popular question get investor call least , regarding openai partnership . openai choose u ? partnership get started ? people worried n't ip 's really required area considered leader , valid concern ? two big question , kevin , one . yeah , let start first one . , think , first foremost , 've able bunch really amazing work openai , work 've done testament well-aligned 've start . initial intention first deal 2019 , wanted third-party like , someone outside microsoft , addition research engineering team , able come incredibly high level ambition trying ai . would put pressure infrastructure system software , could make sure building best possible platform training serving new large-scale frontier model 're calling . - amy hoodand , like think anything like worked incredibly well . like 've able design infrastructure along open ai like quickly partnership , built first ai supercomputer thing gpt-3 trained . addition using infrastructure like 've also able partner using model incredibly creative way power product like yeah , first github copilot . like deployed gpt-3 like whole bunch different way , like relatively silently bunch product . github copilot first generative ai-first product think anyone really built , generative ai front center allowed u thing people thought , five second , launched actually impossible , little bit ﬂavor like bunch application . like deliver like go people 's mind like impossible like , wow , ca n't believe . yeah , nature partnership . , way understand ip right , broad license open ai ip term deal work incredibly closely together part stack . like pushed u incredibly helpful way make sure infrastructure system software world-class , think see right number people choose cloud high-ambition thing . definitely helped u incredible way , sort scale pace delivery . yeah , obviously benefit tremendously well open ai , like think one smartest group ai researcher planet . also complement thing 're well . like like really , really ﬂuid partnership , 're aligned platform vision 're aligned safety responsibility , real mission incredible obligation right society . pretty ﬂexible help one another . think lot people , little bit 's hard capture , relationship company partnership , also internal research capability , partner others . 's unique partnership , fundamentally , think built trust mission alignment , always important thing . reiterate , think two key point made , kevin talked broad perpetual license openai ip developed term partnership , mean even partnership end , would still license right ip , agi . thing that's critical , think , kevin lead lot conversation , legal team openai ethic team , 'm sorry , ai ethic team , share value responsibility safe deployment ip . ca n't tell foundational able make progress . u independently make technology available respective user developer . 're seeing happen . think 's good everyone . really keep innovative spirit . ai capability built azure foundation . , think 's sort long way kevin -- saying feel good - kevin scottabout position 're partnership access ip long-term . , let 's go back think lot people always asking , 's like , '' hey , listen , 're really hearing customer 're going deploy ? '' , `` use case 're seeing today ? '' , `` open mind , use case 'd see tomorrow ? '' would say , maybe 'll say thing 'm hearing , kevin , think probably hear even , especially longer-term 's possible , hosted ceo campus long ago , kevin , hosted conversation met one-on-one , fascinating . mean , every industry , whether 's healthcare , talk epic medical record ; whether manufacturing talking detect describe problem plant headquarters ; whether education personalized tutor retail , developer point , think 's coming almost , would describe , 's global conversation , 's by- industry conversation . , thinking term use case possible , think 're closer industry case sure . yeah , think broadly speaking , particular wave technology transformation going really driving productivity place people cognitive work . sort , totally wordy way saying white collar work . like job , job , like anyone really using mind like something . think going enormously obvious coming month like 's huge amount stuff cognitive work sort routine , repetitive , like 're probably super excited . 's annoying , stressful part job . think , almost every one thing like get impacted short-term tool . way thinking choice term co-pilot describe new type software like really deliberate choice , believe going lot co- pilot , 're going , , general like bing chat chatgpt , like github co-pilot , relatively focused particular type cognitive work . , think , whether 's software development , 's marketing , 's customer support , like -- prior auth insurance . sort pick thing know encounter thing every day multiple time , like , `` ca n't believe 're still thing way . '' moment sort finally , think , get get past `` ca n't believe 're still thing way , '' get go different way . think , longer term , real prize generally capable ai system really go solve big problem . like thing talk folk , n't know happen , 's sort aspirational thing . ai -- scientific expertise ability go think problem really long time . said , hey , $ 100 million worth - amy hood - kevin scottcompute ai expert go cure pancreatic cancer form . like would easiest $ 100 million human being ever gone spend . amount pain suffering economic loss general misery disease cause . 's aspiration future . like system help u go solve problem ca n't solve right , even using best tool ? , better tool help u go solve really nasty problem ? think 's many way time period real concern power technology , far much optimism possibility . think , two thing coexist think frankly always large transition history . thing first , kevin , thank much joining u today . way , think 's better person tell investor 're vision , different person responsible making sure vision strategy get executed best capability . thank taking large mantle u joining u today . thanks everybody watching getting bit educated term 's different approach . say , 've waited long time get productive company , kevin . maybe final secret get increase cfo 's productivity least . thanks everyone look forward delivering really kevin , customer , developer frankly , society think right adoption technology leadership position . thank certainly remain committed leading wave . right . thank , amy .
