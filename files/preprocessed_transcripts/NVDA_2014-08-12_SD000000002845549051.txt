okay . great . well thank joining u afternoon . name mike mcconnell . 'm lead semiconductor analyst pacific crest . 're pleased afternoon chris evenden , investor relation nvidia , representing company . usual , 'll kick q & . always encourage audience participation hopefully hit key topic interested . , let's get started . chris , maybe talk little bit company gross margin . think , opinion , two driver behind stock performance last year , one definitely gross margin expansion . 're close already record high . kind talk reason driving margin expansion think , , sustainable think 's opportunity even higher gross margin ? yes . 's good question . record -- q2 record high significant margin . q2 come higher anticipated couple reason . tesla storming quarter . tegra bit lighter expected . , combined , give u high q2 . even broader picture , 're lot higher -- 've growing gross margin steadily two year think way mid ; high 50 , good place . 's mix , right ? 's also transition business component , chip , platform business . mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnellso look value add market , value lot chip . fact , geforce , quadro , tesla . grid , physically , 's piece silicon . thing 's different software ecosystem build around . produce really high-performing , high-quality 3d driver . got geforce . 've got gaming gpu consumer . optimize professional application . shedloads capability testing stability testing . 've got quadro , dominant market share workstation space . build cuda ecosystem , parallel programming ecosystem . arrange university train ten thousand people program parallel code hardware . 've got tesla . , really platform . actually software engineer hardware engineer . think 's key value . 's margin going much . 's 've able grow high- margin business , particularly quadro tesla . grid refer option growth look like 's going great business . 's n't proof point yet 're trial stage still . trial moving nicely . trial moving extremely nicely q q every quarter last year . one thing talked earnings call year , build grid test drive , allows log website try grid one challenge people , department evaluating virtual desktop infrastructure , evaluate , pretty much build one . 's actually lot work expensive . , show actually give good user experience , support application n't think supported virtual desktop infrastructure . go see eye , really encourage take next stage actually start thinking pilot project 's big first hump get people . , -- first eight week operation , 10,000 people tried . seems really interesting demand . chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnellyes . 's great . looking think thing , opinion , shareholder return , program well received investor base . 're little halfway last -- second tranche $ 1 billion . think , look domestic cash position , 's little bit le 50 % net cash . kind talk comfort level maybe going forward get second tranche company 's thinking continuing investor return shareholder return ? keep pace guess think ? n't want commit anything next year . last year , gave back $ 1 billion , $ 1 billion actually . year , said intend give back $ 1 billion . -- , math , dividend come $ 190 million . 've already done $ 500 million -- executed $ 500 million asr finished june . leaf $ 310 million presumably repurchase presumably . 's rest year . generate cash offshore . -- n't actually given split recently . probably math . let see said publicly . 've said publicly 80/20 offshore/onshore convert . gave u $ 1.5 billion u cash issued . -- actually net -- bit le $ 1.5 billion . 's . going forward , lot option . 're still strong generator cash . clearly , 'd rather pay 35 % bring back country . , there's always hope change . strong cash position mean plenty option going forward . okay . fair say management 's still committed shareholder return . 'm saying -- . -- yes , n't want make promise next year . certainly , would speak last -- $ 2 billion two year quite lot return , right ? yes . 's well received . okay . great . look guess near term , lot thing kind around company -- whether commentary competition , foundry , thing supply chain . guy great quarter , knocked park guidance . chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evendeni guess , -- including , get thing wrong ? missing 's maybe putting nvidia separate thing pointing concerned going kind near- term environment ? 's interesting question , quite honestly -- 've -- every time someone side fence raise doubt channel , go back team business manager say : tell channel . probe quite closely want make sure fully understand issue . , honestly , seeing issue channel . q2 unfolded much expected geforce perspective . -- , divide geforce business gaming , sort high-value fewer-units side business . oem , high-volume , low-value , low- gross-margin business sell hp , dell . lenovo pretty much entirely . business trajectory expected . gaming business quite sharply q2 strong q4 western holiday basically . strong q1 eastern holiday , chinese new year . fell strongly q2 , always . oem , conversely , actually strong q2 build back school july , right ? 's nothing happens may june . july back school . nonlinearity quarter , 's see ar spike well point -- raised one report . that's see ar spike q2 well . saw ar spike last q2 's least linear quarter significant margin . , , 60 % sale -- ? -- 's typical . 's much . 's , high past . 's dynamic . -- , maybe seeing fall gaming q2 . fall 'd already factored , right ? understood . talk inventory , 're inventory problem channel . , competitor may inventory problem . 's better question . could inventory affect u exist ? intuitively , 'd expect , right , point , reduce price shift . mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evendennow , trouble screw channel . mess future sale 's diﬃcult go back channel sell something full price 're going try wait two week see happens , right ? 've got careful -- ca n't reduce price willy-nilly . excess inventory , 've since april , right , cryptocurrency mining , fell cliff mid-march , right ? -- two reason , right ? one , cost coin went . two , asics came market could mine . literally switched . 's around , right ? certainly n't affect q2 . well n't participate market anyway , right ? . , 'm saying amd 's excess inventory n't apparent effect u . n't seem affecting u way . , year year , dynamic interesting , look q2 compared last q2 , -- way , record second quarter . 's best second quarter ever . look year-on-year dynamic , pc gaming . pc oem . think 's indicative true long-term trend two segment . pc gaming estimate growing 10 % year market . oem weak . think 's probably going long-term weakness . 's driven couple thing , principally fact consumer notebook market whole weak , right ? , -- 's exposure consumer mainstream oem graphic market . generate -- although generates lot unit . 'll see market share number . 'll see attach rate number , n't generate much revenue . generates even le profit asp low . gm low well . , think -- hear , like , intel talking consumer emerging market still diﬃcult , careful 's mostly oem . -- ? mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell -- imagine 's 're talking , yes . 's -- n't think anyone would look pc market say : hi . 's market want part . guy putting pretty good result . -- exactly . -- 's point . pc gaming market actually really good market . 's really healthy . 67 million people play league legend every month , right ? -- regularly peak 7.5 million concurrent user . amount prize money dota 2 tournament , defense ancient tournament seattle last month greater price purse british open , right ? $ 10 million prize money . -- 's five -- 's team game , five people team . team member took home $ 1 million . others got le . 45 million people post clip twitch every month . 's , healthy . 've got great game coming fall , assassin 's creed , latest assassin 's creed , latest battlefield , latest call duty . 's bunch really good game coming . ultimately , 's game drive revenue . think another surprise positive , right , last quarter tesla quadro . , tesla , guess used kind lumpier business . kind starting see -- know 've talked , steadier oem adoption . 're getting bigger lump . 're getting bigger lump . yes , ( inaudible ) problem . . chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnellbut -- carry forward back half year new level , tough know ? 's diﬃcult talk tesla customer bit cagy want u say . tesla think -- tesla 's breakout year , like , last year . 's really started zooming . grew 37 % year year , largely strength distribution channel effectively . anyone 's anyone supercomputer selling tesla off-the-shelf solution . whether 's ibm cray supermicro nec , guy . big strategic agreement ibm , 're actually looking port enterprise application hadoop analytics , big data analytics tesla . 's hugely promising . also , big thing ibm 're going put nvlink power v8 build really high-performance supercomputer fast data connection cpu gpu . 's lot business . 's -- breakout last year distribution code porting . year , interesting thing 's driving -- accelerating growth , like , consumer internet company , consumer service provider . looking particularly image recognition speech recognition . turn -- 's interesting , n't , thing brain easily , computer find diﬃcult . , good speech recognition good image recognition computationally incredibly intensive . , 're using sophisticated machine-learning algorithm running deep neural network , run tesla better serve aligned interest . 's ( inaudible ) amount computer power give better advertising . start come fruition last quarter ? couple big order last quarter , yes . okay . 's great . question audience ? unidentified participant chris evenden unidentified participant chris evendenso rich -- ceo shazam , keynote earlier panel . brought basically 're using gpus inside datacenter . unique kind specific kind internet use case scenario , -- seeing broader interest tesla traditional internet cloud space ? well , 's speech recognition . 's akin . like , pattern recognition massive datasets suppose perhaps broader way putting . shazam one great example . 's customer 'm actually allowed talk . netﬂix published research 're using nvidia well . n't given much detail beyond . generally , talking ad . , look . , example . let -- want give clear example without implying anyone 's customer customer . imagine post social networking site , post picture new dog , right ? , social networking company able recognize dog photograph , would start selling information dog food advertiser , would buy ad page , right , 're targeting ( inaudible ) . , maybe could recognize picture baby advertise diaper . 's diﬃcult task , recognizing baby . 's diﬃcult enough recognize face . 's lot value able tag photo appropriately , example . , 's one -- another example . voice recognition , driving user interface voice another one requires surprising amount compute power , particularly training stage they're learn -- 're training algorithm recognize word correctly . shazam great example . like talk . plenty others well . -- tesla hpc % ( inaudible ) versus kind kind non-hpc type -- ? -- n't given breakdown . trouble , like , 's -- even gave q2 , might useful answer big win consumer internet q2 , might distort . gave mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evendenyou year , consumer internet new . would understate . ca n't give useful answer . estimate tesla $ 50 million quarter nice jump last quarter . yes . tesla whole , separate whole . 's right -- 's ballpark . -- breaking consumer internet versus hpc -- . -- word . yes . 's good . 's good . let 's talk mobile little bit , right ? analyst day , lot talk company -- tegra , 're talking tegra automotive . lot tablet , lot smartphones . people started reading . kind talk commitment tablet smartphones longer term thinking ? sure . well 're still interesting market u . acknowledged 've withdrawn mainstream smartphone market . mainstream smartphone market , frankly , commoditized faster thought would . thought 'd place differentiated product within marketplace . n't really . market competes price schedule , pricing , availability . 's market 'd ever want compete . 're still interested high-end phone . me3 good example something 's driving revenue u tablet well , mepad . suppose coincidence yowme [ ph ] youme aggressive company focused growth , focused differentiation , finding place market . , help , whereas , 're using off-the-shelf arm core everybody else off-the-shelf graphic core everybody mike mcconnell chris evenden mike mcconnell chris evendenelse , 's really hard build new chip new device actually different anybody else 's . 're still focused . 're working really , really hard build gaming ecosystem android . believe -- 1.1 billion unit market year , 's going segmentation , like 've seen pc , right ? -- , pc market , broadly speaking , n't look like good market . gaming pc , great market . think make argument mobile well . broadly speaking , big challenge market . gaming niche defensible , 's profitable . 's something really add value . 're component supplier , right ? 're platform provider adding value far value silicon actually get sold motherboard . spending tegra 's $ 400 million ? yes . 's -- 's number gave . n't split automotive ? . n't ( inaudible ) . also , give u nice solid base 's growing steadily . give u opportunity keep working building gaming ecosystem 's going hard , right ? n't happen overnight . 've built -- tegra k1 , 've got great chip 's capable supporting latest graphical apis , right ? 've ported bunch major game engine across . suppose one people familiar unreal engine 4. 's one google used io demo new android . amazing , incredibly high-fidelity demo . 've ported source across see half- life 2 portal shield . 've ported unity engine 3 , id tech 5. several engine ca n't name top head . mike mcconnell chris evendenand thinking behind make much le expensive game developer port game across android tegra . 's lower-risk proposition perspective . spend $ 60 million developing title ps4 xbox . , incremental cost bringing android could quite low certainly low context original $ 60 million . actually n't know number . 's relatively low 's already running -- 's running unreal engine 4 ps4 . need run unreal engine 4 android . 's tweaking need . 's level tweaking rather porting , right ? 's rewrite . 's strategy . 's chicken-and-egg issue gaming android . 're trying prime pump , mix metaphor . get going . okay . okay . question audience ? think time one two . okay . 've got ask question . intel licensing , -- supposed think -- 's probability re-up [ ph ] , 's confidence ? 'd love able give , like , progress bar say 68 % complete , right ? 's going happen , right ? 's either 0 % 100 % . 's . intel licensing . , 's -- let take step back 's lot misinformation around licensing . cross-license intel . , agreement sue . 's like recipe book full clever idea use build graphic . n't work way . n't get see patent they're published , three year 've filed . engineer 've spoken say : n't happen . 're sitting bench thinking : problem memory interface . 'll go see nvidia . 's agreement sue . 's recognition fact thousand engineer working clever processor technology . thousand engineer working clever processor technology . 're going overlap invent thing point , n't want sue . reason 's net ﬂow cash smaller company larger company revenue risk patent litigation , right ? 's cross license . actually , pay well . pay $ 6 million every $ 66 million pay u . 's cross-licensing deal . mike mcconnellnow , cover patent , patent patent perpetuity march 31st , 2017. april 1st , 2017 , 've got patent sue . however , 've still got 6,000 engineer working technology area intel . would assume , eventually , 're going end situation . , 's question : well intel want wait take court ? think 's right -- three year ' time 've published bunch new patent think strong ? , think : well hang , negotiation position never going strong today april 1st , 2017. maybe 'll renegotiate hope much better deal . nvidia get continuity revenue . 'll get lower payment . everyone 's happy . 's . 's -- n't take context fact working closely company sign licensing deal . think 'll see success next 2.5 year . meanwhile , 've got profitable growth business , tesla grid well think , also offset well . 's -- 's lot reason think sky falling . 's lot reason positive . whole , would say , saw last report , q2 actually . company firing cylinder , particularly gpu business automotive well . 's debate mobile tegra . think 've explained strategy 're interested . 've got like two minute left , n't ? think 'll use 30 second say : pc gaming really strong . people want compare u someone . compare u amd . , technically , compete head head market , look actually drive financial result , 're different thing . someone asked earlier today : n't -- n't business behaving way amd 's ? 's like : 're driven completely different dynamic , right ? amd 's business dominated mainstream entry-level consumer pc console extent . business dominated high-end gaming pc workstation supercomputing couple thing well , completely different business driver . , ca n't extrapolate one . , 's frustrating see people trying draw parallel none exist . 's small part business . bit oem graphic area overlap . drive little revenue even le profit . operatorthanks clarification . 's helpful . thank much , chris . really appreciate time . question answer question .
