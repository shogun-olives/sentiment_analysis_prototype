're going 30-minute fireside chat room . question , mics sort walked around , 's one stationary . please raise hand 'll try get . 'll start thing . first colette , really appreciate . 's great people live year hiatus really appreciate guy participating year . thank . first question tend ask really setting stage question . think since last time stage , stock sixfold . think stock 150 % year . help u remind least remind people audience , 's vision , mission statement jensen company . specifically , try fulfill kind vision , especially around recent acquisition like mellanox proposed acquisition arm . sure . great question start thank breaking ice holding first in-person investor conference , 're glad . vision nvidia may really changed long period time . set journey helping accelerated computing . first app found could use accelerated computing gaming , 's still heart soul company continue improve . find great use case platform accelerated computing . one great outcome accelerated computing ai q - john pitzer - colette m. kressbuilding . look forward think u full stack data center computing company . mean full stack , mean start layer layer . first layer think chip , system build second layer , would platform layer focused engine important much acceleration . everything rtx ai simulation , many type engine important u . , lastly , top part stack software . enable software framework towards application different industry 's 've designed full stack . mellanox added really think overall data center computing world looking full data center end-to-end , every step along way data networking part . 've great addition u 'll continue build upon strategy future growth well . question answer ( question answer ) lot company specific question , 'd like start kind bigger picture question state industry today clearly we're one worst supply shortage semiconductor industry ever seen . look kind guy done last couple quarter , purchase obligation 45 % sequentially last quarter 40 % sequentially quarter , 35 % sequentially quarter . tight current environment ? expect sort supply actually start accelerate actually meet unfulfilled demand see largest issue deal demand greater supply , demand greater supply . 've working last 18 month focusing supply , really understanding world changed term need think procuring supply . range everything starting wafer , substrate , component , contract manufacturer . talk distribution logistics , company really think . 's also taking full ecosystem . think supply ahead product , also thinking supply system may enable downstream . 's started focusing full ecosystem . also therefore started procure longer term . discussion supplier see going forward , help enable build capacity need support system going forward . helping working long-term procurement see purchase commitment , see inventory . long q - john pitzer - colette m. kress q - john pitzertake bounce ? 's diï¬ƒcult say . feel good , course , guidance provided , feel good beginning next year 've computed , think second half next year , think , 'll great position given much work 've already done long-term procurement . talked call back recent quarter environment supply tight , kind take seasonality throw window . growth next couple quarter really function much supply get ? question number one . second question around , given concern gaming around crypto guy done much better job cmp try ring-fence potential risk , 's kind silly think lean channel inventory today gaming think crypto big overhang could potentially come problem anytime soon ? yes . first think seasonality , get asked quite often term quarter-to-quarter seasonality . 's common question , correct , supply constraint really operating demand level need fill , think supply behind . yes , seasonality restored , 's clear term restore supply constraint world . secondly , think gaming business , one probably impacted lack seasonality , still case demand strongly exceeds supply channel inventory low level . work day trying improve situation , 's lot different reason causing . one , rtx phenomenal new capability gaming . really transform game maker making game , creatives working every single day . exceeding overall gaming market whole , continuing expand new use case beyond gamer , creatives , broadcaster . additionally , 've seen large rise notebook . notebook gaming , high-end notebook still thin light best gaming . take gaming everywhere great growth driver u well . finding making sure supply well way oems important part work today . , lastly , probably still cryptocurrency -- number , diï¬ƒcult anybody quantify ca n't see piece . lean channel inventory step done create avenue crypto money , believe 're really good position continue grow . - colette m. kressand colette , probably number one question get nvidia , especially n't want jinx thing . 're knocking door trillion dollar valuation , astounding . really tam opportunity ? 've many discussion think latest -- 's really data center question think gaming question . think latest number guy gave last analyst day $ 100 billion tam . look number think , okay , guy trying balance something 's big something 's credible . know lot bottom work go , struggle room trying figure tam . tried look attach rate gpus server shipment . look fundamentally nvidia 're fundamentally lowering cost analytics typically look technology , , one half ecosystem figure way thing cheaper . half ecosystem come brand new use case always grow market significantly larger . 're also augmenting 're silicon , mentioned earlier prepared -- opening remark 're augmenting silicon software stack . think tam opportunity inside data center time ? yeah . really good break success , tam large . one , created capability acceleration streamline entire path term process data . think back pile pile data , analyzed , able get . think world prior end moore 's law , never going opportunity get done . huge transformation aha came forth new platform approach really expanded tam . 's easiest look attach rate server 're server 're going change overall configuration within data center regarding number gpus versus number server whole . 's exactly best way look . analyzed industry , much spend , procure data center getting understanding quickly would move accelerated world . , dream , thought , vision move acceleration . fast ? depends . come software approach . software approach really help enterprise make move . enterprise need help stitching together system , software , overall application framework application move accelerated work . 've chosen large overall industry , industry know would benefit quite quickly accelerated ai model . thus absorbed created large tam . started 100 billion , probably last time stage white chair , 've added quite thing well . choice adding software separately , adding licensing software enterprise separately . favorite topic term omniverse also term opportunity . also n't included grace cpu , niche cpu 's really focused high performance computing ai , attached overall vision 's data center computing whole 'll focus q - john pitzer - colette m. kress q - john pitzerevery single part data center . tam , opportunity large . large get ? 's un -- unknown , big market u . brought software 's area get lot question . think last time spoke oï¬ „ ine get 10 % revenue . think , 's sort threshold think breaking standalone within financials . one rate . two , quickly get ? guess , third question exactly ? vmware announcement ai enterprise software 'm dumb silicon guy , hard time spelling software . help explain audience , software suite tool 're actually providing enterprise within jv ? okay . recent announcement discussed amount software available quite large . software new we've providing . 've talked many year success really system software key thing provide free . example , cuda , 30 million downloads 3 million developer . free , 's development platform also write software . assist even beyond overall cuda thing bring . bring market ai framework , application different framework engine 've talked . 's opportunity u sell software separately . would ? big opportunity front u working enterprise . enterprise key term assistance need . say assistance , need support . ability license know come u seek support need application key . work vmware important . ? enterprise use vmware . incorporated stack use inside data center see view model job virtualization accelerated server way cpu server , 's initial important step enterprise well . linking together bell whistle enterprise need . application offer separately ? several right . enterprise ai opportunity general availability signing customer within infrastructure well . 'll talk term omniverse well . also something 's available creatives . time time , 'll . 150 stks . 65 revised and/or new people look . goal helping enterprise move world acceleration . really question business going grow faster . benchmark provide u think software might actually reportable segment within model ? - colette m. kress q - john pitzer - colette m. kress q - john pitzer software assistance term helping bigger piece , overall purchasing infrastructure . software multiplier , infrastructure purchased . provide metric along way term signing term software . likely able see piece still balance sheet piece , 'll talk time time . go back three four year ago , think , one concern ai market well positioned training , perhaps well positioned inference . view overall ai market end point would 25 % training , 75 % inference fear maybe mix would exact opposite given core ip . 've kind changed . talk little bit inference side market ? talked faster growing portion fastest growing portion ai last several quarter . far mix ai business ? go limiter -- people thought might three four year ago . yes . inferencing inferencing gpus extremely successful . probably year ago sitting room talking going go world inferencing knew taken cpu world . understood complexity inferencing front u important programmability ï¬‚exibility platform take larger workload . inferencing growing faster overall data center whole . indicate inferencing thing , would inferencing processor . processor platform-specific inferencing , also different thing a100 . a100 ampere 100 opportunity provide . opportunity training , could take portion a100 divide specific inferencing type job . even counting inferencing platform-specific , still growing faster overall data center , including overall a100 . overall approach providing ï¬‚exible system platform , also software we've enabled many different inferencing type framework , extremely successful . mentioned omniverse earlier . people call metaverse facebook -- rebranded . want careful couch would argue omniverse background driver business forever . think sort metaverse interface physical digital world , nvidia throughout history trying improve interface . 've gaming 're moving broader space . i'm curious , inï¬‚ection point omniverse , metaverse ? need ar , vr kind catch ? , , think bullish long-term trend - colette m. kress q - john pitzer - colette m. kress q - john pitzer - colette m. kressfor . 'm trying figure 's little bit overhyped near- term ? okay . omniverse piece technology next wave technology 've talking couple year . great thing , brings together different piece already simulation collectively . let 's talk . first , think rtx . rtx ability simulate light real time . additionally , done acceleration huge amount simulation high performance computing add piece ai done . really omniverse simulating accurate physic 3d world , 3d collaborative virtual environment . think 're 3d world , 're really yet . 're thinking last 18 month , 've focused 2d world little screen front u . conference actually n't person digital twin would little digital twin onto -- stage , -- ca n't wait day . ca n't wait day well . okay . omniverse really brings together best breed everything developed . architecture advanced year , omniverse available . include vr , include ar , everything collaborative u , work space , help term manufacturing design well . well , 'm curious everyone , investor tend tactile creature , see touch something , 's meaningful u seems like omniverse really going take first might scientific industrial simulation . might first killer app room wake one day go , oh god , 're , omniverse present . yeah . let 's start first though , important manufacturing . important architecture . 's important area spend lot time collaborating across world . team different type region particularly hybrid environment , term working different space overall oï¬ƒce . world taking large document look 2d design effective anymore . one , want see real time . finished three quarter way design say need make change . q - john pitzer - colette m. kressthey want single source truth design . well , wait minute , version . version 17 , 'm version 5. keep design world working ? omniverse really help many large manufacturer collectively collaborate design becomes real , something changed change could rather expensive . term probably see , thing bot , okay , 'll see call center , see place -- customer service accomplished . probably two thing would available every single day u . additionally , 'll probably car little assistant inside car . get home , get judy 's house ? different thing also available using omniverse . want go back gaming brought rtx earlier . one question always get , model long-term gaming growth ? went back looked past analyst day , think last time quantified could , , correct . sort mid-teens type cagr half coming unit , half coming asp kind thought business . look 've last couple year , five-year cagr 25 % . look last couple year , 's well 40 % 60 % . think help kind form concern crypto related something else . talk little bit kind think long-term growth ? rtx really played unit versus asp ? think , one interesting data point penetration rtx curve versus prior cryptic correction gtx ? yes . think gaming , rtx important technology brought world . first architecture setting stone ecosystem begin work building game . right , number game using rtx almost new game , important high-end type game rtx . 've seen industry whole , whether 'll working gpus , whether 'll working console , focused rtx . give u ability u grow desktop , also notebook important piece . ability upgrade large installed base . 's upgrading last architecture , thinking two architecture ray- tracing . important architecture . popular architecture term performance . think two architecture , performance improvement rtx , popular . probably continue bigger overall gaming industry think overall growth supporting gamers . supporting creator . supporting broadcaster , broadcaster lot different universe , whether 're ar , vr working term contractor enterprise . 's high-end graphic important piece . q - john pitzer - colette m. kress q - john pitzer - colette m. kress q - john pitzer - colette m. kresswhen think driving growth . unit ? asp ? yes , 's . . upgrade , bringing new user also pay per ad continuing turn higher end platform really make purchase top part stack well . well , one thing think 's appreciated . mentioned couple time comment , 's penetration notebook market discrete graphic . help u understand think curve 's great story nvidia last several year ? would argue one key driver growth rate probably accelerated versus history ? important piece , really working oems design , working together ecosystem help understand , put great gpu notebook desktop really transformed . think world today hybrid work environment , remoteness , laptop , workstation , mobile workstation important . max-q technology enabled key really assisted gaming , also workstation well . think 're getting close full penetration , go notebook market ? 's plenty place go . think , current arena oems working fine-tuning , one ship right get ready overall holiday key thing . 's opportunity additional , penetration everybody high end gpu notebook mean . business get lot attention , 's good segue rtx , provis . remember guy first introduced rtx , actually brought bunch analyst headquarters still in-person visit pitch really rtx could actually provis business . look , business experiencing accelerating growth last couple quarter , guess 'm trying figure , reopening trade that's helping business 're actually starting see rtx bringing cost rendering creating new market new application ? think one highlighted first introduce rtx actually could actually stimulate -- simulate housing , real estate instead driving around seeing four house five hour , see 40 house hour virtually . q - john pitzer - colette m. kress q - john pitzerabsolutely . workstation market , strong growth last several quarter . would say , part due environment . 's really future environment creating . hybrid ability folk workstation home well oï¬ƒce important . able upgrade rtx save tremendous amount time , resource finish work many great area . 've seen entertainment industry term need create overall film . 've helped stitch together overall rendering . use example , real estate , many example creatives working using rtx assist creative , whether catalog , picture , type thing done using rtx . -- trend moment , something probably take u many year . another end market software strategy going start paying dividend auto announcement made mercedes , guess year , 2024 autonomous driving . -- 's business that's kind winding legacy product 's ramping new core product . think kind growth business get '23 , '24 . think , past 've talked either $ 5 billion $ 8 billion worth backlog like five-year period . talking autonomous pipeline analyzed company signed term creating autonomous robotaxis , trucking passenger car daimler . market size 8 billion look 2027. see today , 're still early day term providing sample , continuing build end end platform car . way think , yes , may start end '23 , move '24 . hit 8 billion total . quite important part term accelerates first couple year . 's important part n't mean infrastructure inside car , also software opportunity . creatively working daimler , helping software 'll share software -- company procure putting autonomous vehicle inside passenger car . couple modeling question come end . first , gross margin . 's lot headwind current environment . 's inï¬‚ation , 's logistics . 're ramping new product . 's longer-term sort view gross margin ? one . two , report january quarter , one helpful thing gave u , look next fiscal year opex . much tell guy like u look opex rev ratio back revenue , inevitably . think kind opex given opportunity set front ? - colette m. kress q - john pitzer - colette m. kress q - john pitzer yeah . still get asked quite bit gross margin . probably one key metric people look semiconductor company , -- 've discussed , 're different . 're different term thinking u full platform perspective . best thing 've able gross margin incorporate software many platform 're , meaning , software gross margin 's gross margin successful . look platform put margin grown particularly related data center people purchasing high- end card market . go forward , probably distance , software becomes important part , whether autonomous vehicle , whether thing standalone , 've got another ability raise overall gross margin . think opex . 're right , tend try assist thinking investment level . model versus revenue . n't . know important part company invest correctly , invest appropriately enables u build product , bring market , investing , provide assistance term know control . opex thing control 'll talk going forward . huge market opportunity front u . great exciting idea . 's job think one fund ? one nearest boat , thing need fund today , thing longer term also want . point time , thing providing revenue today , thing providing revenue little bit future certainly work 're long-term time . great . 've come end time , want thank colette , simona , everyone room joining u . great . really appreciate time morning . thank . thank .
