's lot ph.ds stanford . 's important . yes . okay . come . thank . andrej started computer vision class stanford . 's much significant . 's matter . -- please talk background way bashful . tell story exactly done . yeah , mean -- yeah , see , think 've training neural network basically decade neural network actually really used industry maybe five six year ago . 's time 've trained neural network included situation stanford opening eye google really training lot neural network image , also natural language designing architecture couple two modality ph.d. -- computer science class . - andrej karpathy - unidentified speaker - andrej karpathy - unidentified speaker oh ! yeah . stanford actually taught computer neural network class . primary instructor class . actually started course designed entire curriculum . beginning 150 student grew 700 student next two three year . 's popular class , 's one largest class stanford right . also really successful . mean , andrej , like really one best computer vision people world , arguably best . okay . thank . yeah . hello , everyone . pete told chip 've designed run neural network car . team responsible training neural network includes data collection ﬂeet , neural network training deployment chip . neural network exactly car . 're seeing stream video across vehicle , across car . eight camera send u video neural network looking video processing making prediction 're seeing . , thing 're interested thing 're seeing visualization lean-line marking , object , distance object , call drivable space shown blue , car allowed go lot prediction like traﬃc light , traﬃc sign . talk talk roughly -- three stage . first 'm going give short primer neural network work 're trained . need need explain second part big deal ﬂeet 's important 's key enabling factor really train neural network making work effectively road . third stage , 'll talk vision lidar estimate depth vision alone . core problem network solving car visual recognition . -- simple problem . look four image see contain cello , boat , iguana scissors . simple effortless u . case computer . reason image computer really massive grid pixel pixel brightness value point . instead seeing image computer really get million number grid tell brightness value position . - andrej karpathyyou may tell u , , really matrix . yeah . go grid pixel brightness value high level concept like iguana . might imagine iguana certain pattern brightness value . iguana actually take many appearance . many different appearance , different pose different brightness condition different background . different crop iguana . robust across condition understand different brightness pattern actually correspond iguana . reason good massive neural network inside head processing image . light hit retina , travel back brain visual cortex visual cortex consists many neuron wired together pattern recognition top image . really last , would say five year , state-of-the-art approach processing image using computer also started use neural network . case artificial neural network . artificial neural network , cartoon diagram , rough mathematical approximation visual cortex . 'll really neuron connected together . 'm showing three four neuron three four -- four layer . typical neural network ten hundred million neuron neuron thousand connection . really large piece almost simulated tissue . take neural network show image . example , feed iguana neural network network make prediction 's seeing . beginning neural network initialized completely randomly . connection strength different neuron completely random , therefore prediction network also going completely random . might think 're actually looking boat right 's unlikely actually iguana . training -- training process really 're , know 's actually iguana . label . 're 're basically saying 'd like probability iguana larger image probability thing go . 's mathematical process called backpropagation stochastic gradient descent allows u back propagate signal connection update every one connection little amount . update complete , probability iguana image go little bit . might become 14 % probability thing go . course , n't single image . actually entire large data set labeled . lot image typically might million image , thousand label something like forward backward pass . 're showing computer 's image . opinion 're saying correct answer tune little bit . repeat million time sometimes show image , image computer hundred time well . network training typically take order hour day depending big network 're training . 's process training neural network . 's something unintuitive way neural network work really get , really require lot example really start scratch . know nothing . 's really hard wrap head around . example , 's cute dog probably may know breed dog , correct answer japanese spaniel . u looking 're seeing japanese spaniel , 're like , okay , got . understand kind japanese spaniel look like show image dog , probably pick japanese spaniel . particular three look like japanese spaniel one . quickly need one example , computer work like . actually need ton data japanese spaniel . grid japanese spaniel showing , need thousand example showing different pose , different brightness condition , different background , different crop . really need teach computer different angle japanese spaniel look like really requires data get work . otherwise computer ca n't pick pattern automatically . imply setting self-driving . course , n't care dog breed much . maybe 'll roll point , really care lane line marking , object , , drive . way n't label like iguana image , image ﬂeet like , 're interested , example , lane line marking . , human , typically go image using mouse annotates lane line marking . 's example annotation human could create label image . 's saying 's seeing image . lane line marking . , go ﬂeet ask image ﬂeet . ask ﬂeet , neat job ask image random , ﬂeet might respond image like , typically going forward highway . might get like random collection like , would annotate data . 're careful annotate random distribution data , network kind pick random distribution data work regime . show slightly different example , example image actually -- road curving bit residential neighborhood . show neural network , image , network might make prediction incorrect , might say okay , well 've seen lot time highway , lane go forward , 's possible prediction . course incorrect . neural network really ca n't blamed , know train -- tree left whether matter , know car right matter towards lane line . know building background matter . really start completely scratch . know truth none thing matter , actually matter white lane line like marking vanishing point . fact curl little bit pull prediction , except mechanism tell neural network , hey lane line marking actually matter . tool toolbox labeled data . , need take image like network fails need label correctly . case turn lane right . need feed lot image neural net neural net time accumulate -- basically pick pattern thing n't matter , lane line marking learn predict correct lane . 's really critical scale dataset , n't want million image , actually need really good job covering possible space thing car might encounter road . need teach computer handle scenario 's night wet . different specular reﬂections might imagine brightness pattern image look different . teach computer deal shadow , deal fork road , deal large object might taking image , deal tunnel deal construction site . case , 's explicit mechanism tell network , massive amount data , want source image want annotate correct line network pick pattern . large varied data set make -- basically make network work well . finding u tesla , ubiquitous finding across entire industry . experiment research google , facebook , baidu , alphabet 's deepmind show similar plot neural network really love data love scale variety , add data , neural network start work better get higher accuracy free . data make work better . number company -- number people kind pointed potentially could use simulation actually achieve scale data set 're charge lot condition , maybe achieve variety simulator . tesla also kind brought question . tesla actually screenshot q - unidentified participant - unidentified speakersimulator . use simulation extensively , use develop evaluate software . 've also even use training quite successfully , -- really come training data neural network , really substitute real data . simulator -- simulation lot trouble modeling appearance , physic behavior agent around . example really drive point across , real world really throw lot crazy stuff . case example complicated environment snow , tree , wind . various visual artifact hard simulate potentially , complicated construction site , bush plastic bag go kind go round wind . complicated construction site might feature lot people , kid , animal mixed simulating thing interact ﬂow construction zone might actually completely intractable . 's movement one pedestrian , 's respond car respond respond driving setting actually really tricky simulate . 's almost like solve self-driving problem simulate car simulation . 's really complicated . dog , exotic animal case 's even simulate , 's ca n't even come . example n't know truck-on-truck-on-truck like , real world find find lot thing hard really even come . really variety 'm seeing data coming ﬂeet crazy , respect simulator , really good simulator . yeah , 's think like simulation -- 're fundamentally grading homework . know -- know 're going simulate , okay , kind definitely solve , saying , n't know -- know world weird million corner case . somebody produce self-driving simulation accurately match reality , would monumental achievement human capability , ca n't , 's way . yeah . think three point really try drive home get neural network work well , require three essential , require large dataset , varied dataset real dataset . capability , actually train neural network make work well . tesla unique interesting position really get free essential right ? answer course ﬂeet . really source data make neural network system work extremely well . let take concrete example -- example making object detector work better , give sense develop neural network , iterate actually get work time ? object detection something care lot . 'd like put bounding box around say car object need track need understand might move around . , might ask human annotator give u annotation human might go might tell , okay , pattern car bicycle . train neural network , 're careful , neural network make mispredictions case . example , stumble car like , bike back , neural network actually went joined -- would actually create two detection , would create car detection bicycle detection . 's actually kind correct guess object actually exist , purpose controller planner downstream , really n't want deal fact bicycle go car . truth bike attached car . term like object road , 's single object , single car . 'd like 'd like potentially annotate lot image single car . process go internally team take image image show pattern mechanism , machine learning mechanism ask ﬂeet source u example look like . ﬂeet might respond image contains pattern . example six image might come ﬂeet , contain bike back car . would go would annotate single car . performance detector actually improves network internally understands , hey , bike attached car 's actually single car . learn given enough example 's sort fix problem . mention talk quite bit sourcing data ﬂeet . want make quick point 've designed beginning privacy mind data use training unanalyzed . ﬂeet n't respond bicycle back car , look thing , look lot thing time . example , look boat ﬂeet respond boat . look construction site ﬂeet send u lot construction site across road . look even slightly rare case . example finding debris road pretty important u . example image streamed u ﬂeet show tire , cone , plastic bag thing like . source scale , annotate correctly neural network learn deal world . 's another example , animal course also rare occurrence event . want neural network really understand 's going animal want deal correctly . summarize process iterate neural network prediction look something like . start seed dataset potentially sourced random . annotate dataset train neural network dataset put car . mechanism notice inaccuracy car detector maybe misbehaving . example detect neural network might uncertain detect 's driver intervention setting , create trigger infrastructure sends u data inaccuracy . example n't perform well lane line detection tunnel , notice 's problem tunnel , image would enter unit test , verify 're actually fixing problem time . fix inaccuracy , need source many example look like . ask ﬂeet please send u many tunnel label tunnel correctly . incorporate training set retrain network , redeploy iterate cycle . refer iterative process improve prediction data engine . iteratively , deploying something potentially shadow mode , sourcing inaccuracy incorporating training set . basically prediction neural network . far 've talked lot explicit labeling . like mentioned , ask people annotate data . expensive process time also respect , yeah , 's expensive process time also respect -- yes , expensive process . annotation , course , expensive achieve . , want talk also really utilize power ﬂeet . want go human annotation bottleneck . want stream data automate automatically . multiple mechanism . one example project recently worked detection cut-in . , 're driving highway , someone left right , cut-in front lane . , 's video showing autopilot detecting car intruding lane . , course , 'd like detect cut-in fast possible . way approach problem n't write explicit code left blinker , right blinker , track keyboard time see 's moving horizontally . actually use ﬂeet learning approach . way work , ask ﬂeet please send u data whenever see car transition right lane center lane left center . rewind time backwards , automatically annotate , hey , car turn , well , 1.3 second cut-in front -- front . use training neural net . neural net automatically pick lot pattern . , example , car typically yard . 're moving way , maybe blinker , stuff happens internally inside neural net example . , ﬂeet automatically send data , get 0.5 million image , would annotated cut-in , train network took cut-in network deployed ﬂeet , - elon r. musk q - unidentified participantturn yet . run shadow mode . shadow mode , network always making prediction . hey , think vehicle going cut-in way look . vehicle going cut-in . look mis-predictions . , example , clip shadow mode cut-in network , 's kind hard see , network thought vehicle right ahead u right going cut-in , sort see 's slightly ﬂirting lane line . 's trying -- 's sort encroaching little bit , network got excited thought going cut , vehicle actually end center lane . turn incorrect vehicle actually . , churn data engine . source ran shadow mode making prediction , make false positive false negative detection . , got overexcited , sometimes , sometimes miss cut-in actually happened . create trigger stream u get incorporated free , 's human harmed process labeling data incorporated free training set . retrained network redeployed shadow mode . spin time always look false positive negative coming ﬂeet . 're happy false positive , false negative ratio , actually ﬂipped bit actually let car control network . , may noticed , actually shipped one first version cut-in detector , approximately , think , three month ago . 've noticed car much better detecting cut-in , 's ﬂeet learning operating scale . yes , actually work quite nicely . 's ﬂeet learning , human harmed process , 's lot neural network training based data lot shadow mode looking result . ... essentially like everyone 's training network time amount , whether autopilot , network trained every mile 's driven car . 's harder training network . yes , another interesting way use scheme ﬂeet learning project 'll talk path prediction . , driving car 're actually emitting data steering wheel , 're telling u traverse different environment . , we're looking person ﬂeet took left intersection . full video camera know path person took gps , initial measurement unit , wheel angle , wheel tick . put together understand path person took environment . , course , -- use supervision network . , sourced lot ﬂeet . trained neural network trajectory , - elon r. musk - pete bannon - elon r. musk - pete bannonand neural network predicts path , data . , really referred typically called imitation learning . 're taking human trajectory real world . 'm trying imitate people drive real world , also apply data engine crank make work time . , 's example path prediction going kind complicated environment . 're seeing video overlaying prediction network . path network would follow green , -- yeah . crazy thing network predicting path ca n't even see incredibly high accuracy . ca n't see around corner , saying probability curve extremely high . 's path . nail . see car today . going turn augmented vision , see lane line path prediction car overlaid video . yeah . 's actually going hood even tell ... sound scary . course lot detail 'm skipping . might want annotate driver . might annotate -- might want imitate better driver , 's many technical way actually slice dice data . interesting thing prediction actually 3d prediction , project back image . path forward three dimensional thing 're rendering 2d , know slope ground 's actually extremely valuable driving . prediction actually life ﬂeet today way , 're driving cloverleaf , 're cloverleaf highway , maybe five month ago , car would able cloverleaf . . 's prediction running live car . 've said ago . today going get experience traversing intersection , large component go intersection drive today sourced prediction automatic label . talked far really three key component iterate prediction network make work time . require large , varied real data set . really achieve tesla . scale ﬂeet , data engine , shipping thing shadow mode , iterating cycle potentially even using ﬂeet learning human - unidentified speaker - pete bannonannotators harmed process , using automatically really scale . next section talk , 'm going especially talk depth perception using vision . might familiar least two sensor car . one vision , camera getting pixel lidar lot -- lot company also use . lidar give point measurement distance around . , one thing 'd like point first came -- drove , many , used neuromet vision , shooting laser eye still ended . might , mean , ( multiple speaker ) . clearly human neuromet derives distance measurement 3d understanding world vision . actually us multiple cue . i'll brieﬂy go , give sense roughly 's going inside . example , two eye pointed . get two independent measurement every single time step role ahead , brain stitch information together arrive depth estimation triangulate point across two viewpoint . lot animal , instead , eye positioned side . little overlap visual field . typically use structure motion idea bob head movement actually get multiple observation world triangulate depth . even one eye closed completely motionless , still sense depth perception , n't think would notice coming two meter towards 100 meter back . 's lot strong monocular cue brain also take account . example pretty common visual illusion two blue bar identical , brain , way stitch scene , expects one larger , vanishing line image . brain lot automatically . neuromet , artificial neuromet well . let give three example arrive depth perception vision alone . classical approach two rely network . here's video going , think san francisco tesla . camera , sensing , 're looking -- 'm showing main camera , camera turned , eight camera autopilot . six second clip , stitch environment 3d using multiview stereo technique . supposed video . video ? know 's -- go . 3d reconstruction six second car driving path . see information purely -- well recoverable video , roughly 's process triangulation mentioned multiview stereo , 've applied similar technique , slightly sparse approximate also car . 's remarkable information really sensor , matter extracting . project want brieﬂy talk mentioned 's nothing neural network -- neural network powerful visual recognition engine . want predict depth , need , example , look label depth actually extremely well . 's nothing limiting network predicting monocular depth except label data . one example project 've actually looked internally , use forward facing radar shown blue radar looking measuring depth object . use radar annotate -- vision seeing . bounding box come neural network . instead human annotator telling , okay car bounding box roughly 25 meter away , annotate data much better using sensor . sensor annotation . example radar quite good distance , annotate train network . enough data neural network good predicting pattern . 's example prediction . circle 'm showing radar object -- keyboard coming purely vision . keyboard coming vision depth keyboard learned sensor annotation radar . working well , would see circle top-down view would agree keyboard , 's neural network competent predicting depth . learn different size vehicle internally know big vehicle , actually derive depth quite accurately . last mechanism talk brieﬂy slightly fancy get bit technical , mechanism recently -- 's paper basically last year two approach , 's called self-supervision . lot paper feed raw video neural network label whatsoever , still learn , still get neural network learn depth . 's little bit technical , ca n't go full detail idea neural network predicts depth every single frame video explicit target neural network supposed regress label , instead objective network consistent time . whatever depth predict consistent duration video . way consistent right neural network automatically predicts correct depth pixel reproduce result internally . also work quite well . summary people drive vision , laser involved . seems work quite well . point 'd like make , visual recognition q - unidentified participantpowerful visual recognition absolutely necessary autonomy . 's nice , like must neural network actually really understand environment around , lidar point much le information rich environment . vision really understands full detail point around much -- 's much le information . example left , plastic bag tire ? lidar might give point , vision tell one two true impact control . person slightly looking backwards , trying merge lane bike going forward ? construction site , sign say . behave world ? entire infrastructure built road designed human visual consumption . sign , traﬃc light , everything designed vision . 's information , need ability . person distracted phone ? going walk lane ? answer question found vision necessary level 4 , level 5 autonomy . capability developing tesla . -- done combination large scale neural training data engine getting work time , using power ﬂeet . sense lidar really shortcut . sidestep fundamental problem , important problem visual recognition necessary autonomy . give full sense progress ultimately crotch [ ph ] . give like really fast demo . , summarize entire -- entire talk one slide would . autonomy , want level four , level five system handle possible situation 99.99 % case , chasing last night going tricky diﬃcult 's going require powerful visual system . 'm showing image might encounter one slice nine . beginning simple car going forward . car start look little bit funny , maybe bike car , maybe car car , maybe start get really rare event like car turned even car airborne . see lot thing coming ﬂeet , see rate , -- like really good rate compared competitor . rate progress actually address problem iterate software really feed neural network right data . rate progress really proportional often encounter situation , encounter significantly frequently anyone else 're going extremely well . thank .

's first question . second -- still focus computer vision redundant . second question , - unidentified speaker q - unidentified participant - unidentified speaker q - unidentified participanttrue , happens rest industry 's building autonomy solution lidar ? 're going dump lidar . 's prediction . mark word . point n't actually super hate lidar much may sound spacex -- spacex dragon us lidar navigate space station dock . -- spacex developed lidar scratch i've spearheaded effort personally scenario lidar make sense car 's freaking stupid . 's expensive unnecessary andrej saying , saw vision , 's worthless . expensive hardware that's worthless car . forward radar low cost helpful especially occlusion situation . 's like fog dust snow , radar see . 're gon na use active photon generation , n't use visible wavelength -- passive optical 've taken care visible wavelength stuff , want use wavelength occlusion penetrating like radar . lidar active photon generation visual spectrum . active photon generation , outside visual spectrum radar spectrum . like 3.8 millimeter versus 400 nanometer 700 nanometer , going much better occlusion penetration 's forward radar also 12 ultrasonics near-field information addition eight camera forward radar . radar forward direction 's direction going real fast . 's -- 've gone multiple time like always show right size sweet , add anything ? . hi . right . mentioned asked ﬂeet information 're looking vision . two question . sound like car computation determine kind information send back , correct assumption ? real time based stored information ? yes . absolutely computation real time car wait basically specify condition 're interested car computation . , 'd send data o  ine back-end , n't want . computation car . , 's -- based question , sound like guy really good position currently half million car future potentially million car essentially computer representing free -- almost free data center computational , huge future opportunity tesla ? - unidentified speaker q - unidentified participant - unidentified speaker q - unidentified participant - unidentified speaker q - unidentified participant - unidentified speaker q - matt joyce - elon r. muskit 's current . current opportunity ? 's really factored anything yet . that's incredible . thank . 've 425,000 car hardware tuned beyond mean got eight camera right rador ultrasonics . 've got least video computer enough essentially figure information important , , compress information important salient element upload network training . 's massive compression real world data . sort network million computer like massive data center essentially distributed data center computational capacity . see used thing besides self-driving future ? suppose could possibly used something besides self-driving . 're focused self-driving . get really nailed maybe 's going use million ten million computer hardware three four self-driving computer , yeah , maybe would . ( technical diﬃculty ) could -- could like sort aws angle , 's possible . hello . hi , elon , matt joyce , loup venture . model 3 minnesota snow lot . since camera radar see road marking snow , technical strategy solve challenge ? involve high precision gps ? , actually , like today , actually autopilot decent job snow even lane marking covered , even lane marking faded , covered there's lot rain , still seem drive relatively well . n't specifically go snow yet data engine , actually think completely tractable - unidentified speaker q - unidentified participant - unidentified speakerbecause lot image -- even thing snowy , ask human annotator , lane line , actually could tell . actually relatively consistent ( inaudible ) lane line . long annotator consistent data , -- 's -- network pick pattern fine . 's really 's signal even human annotator -- answer yes know fine . yeah , 's actually -- number important signal andrej saying . lane line one thing . one important signal drive space . drivable space drivable space ? actually really matter drivable space lane line prediction drivable space extremely good . think especially upcoming winter incredible . 's like like could possibly good . 's crazy . thing point , maybe 's even human annotator , long human drive environment ﬂeet learning , actually know path took obviously use vision guide path , use lane line marking , used entire geometry entire scene , see -- see road roughly curling , see car positioned around , network pick pattern automatically inside enough data people traversing environment . 's actually extremely important thing rigidly tied gps , gps era vary quite bit actual situation road vary quite bit . could reconstruction , could detour car using gps primary , real bad situation , 's asking trouble . 's fine use gps like tip trick . 's like drive home neighborhood better neighborhood enough like country part country . know neighborhood well use kind like knowledge neighborhood drive confidence maybe counterintuitive shortcut kind thing . 's -- gps overlay data helpful never primary , 's ever primary , 's problem . question back back corner , wanted follow-up partially several competitor space past year made -- talked augmenting perception path planning capability kind car platform high definition map area driving . play role system ? see adding value ? area would like get data collected ﬂeet kind mapping style data ? q - unidentified participant - unidentified speaker q - unidentified participant - unidentified speakeri think high precision -- high type -- high precision gps map lane really bad idea . system becomes extremely brittle . change like -- might -- change system make , ca n't adapt . lock onto gps high precision lane line allow vision override , fact vision thing everything like lane line guideline 're main thing . brieﬂy barked tree high precision lane line realized huge mistake reversed . n't good ? helpful understanding annotation object car drive . negotiation aspect parking roundabout thing car road human-driven 's art science ? pretty good . actually , like , cut stuff , 's really well . yeah , , ( inaudible ) 're using lot machine learning right term predicting kind creating explicit representation road look like 's explicit planner controller top representation 's lot heuristic traverse negotiate . long tail like visual environment look like , 's long tail negotiation game chicken play people . , think lot confidence eventually must kind ﬂeet learning component actually writing rule hand going -- 's going quickly plateau , think . yeah , 've dealt issue cut-in 's like 'll allow gradually aggressive behavior part user , dial setting say , aggressive , 're le aggressive , drive easy , chill mode , aggressive . incredible progress , phenomenal . two question . first , term platooning , think system geared somebody asked snow road , platooning feature , follow car front . system -- system capable ? two follow- ups . 've asked platooning . think like could absolutely build feature . use -- train network , example , imitating human , human already like follow car ahead neural network actually incorporates pattern internally . 's figure 's correlation way car ahead face path going take . 's done internally net . 're concerned getting enough data tricky data neural network q - unidentified participant - unidentified speaker q - unidentified participanttraining process , actually , 's quite magical , stuff automatically . turn different problem one problem , collect data set using lot train . 's three step self-driving , 's feature complete 's future complete agree think person car need pay attention . 's reliability level also convince regulator true . 's kind like three level . expect set feature complete self-driving year expect confident enough standpoint say think people need touch wheel , look window . sometime probably around n't know second quarter next year , start expect get regulatory approval least jurisdiction towards end next year . 's roughly timeline expect thing go . probably truck , tuning approved regulator anything else . like maybe , 're long haul -- long haul freight one driver front four semi trailing behind platooning manner . think probably regulator would quicker approve thing . regarding , course , n't convince u lidar technology , opinion , answer looking question probably dead . mean impressive saw today probably demo could show something . wondering maximum dimension matrix may training deep learning pipeline , ballpark figure ? maximum dimension matrix . know ( inaudible ) apply operation inside ( inaudible ) asking . 's many different way answer question 'm 100 % sure 're useful , 're useful answer , neural ( inaudible ) typically like mentioned ten hundred million neuron , average 1,000 connection neuron . typical scale kind used across industry also would use well . yeah 've actually impressed rate improvement autopilot past year model 3 , two scenario wanted feedback . last week , first scenario right hand lane freeway highway on-ramp model 3 actually able detect two car side , slow let car go front one car go behind like , oh ! gosh , like insane . like n't think model 3 could . like super impressive . week , another scenario right hand lane , right hand lane merging left lane n't on-ramp 's normal highway -- freeway lane . model 3 n't able detect really situation able slow speed intervene , kind . -- perspective kind share -- kind background neural net would - - unidentified speaker q - unidentified participant - unidentified speaker - stuart bowers- tesla might adjust ? could improved -- time ? yeah . like mentioned , sophisticated trigger infrastructure . intervened , 's actually potentially likely receive clip actually analyze see happened tune system . probably enter statistic , okay , rate correctly merging traﬃc . look number look clip see 's wrong try fix clip make progress benchmark . yes . ( technical diﬃculty ) yes . would potentially go phase categorization look biggest kind category actually seem semantically related simple problem . would look try develop software . okay , one presentation software like essentially hardware stuart , 's sort neural net vision andrej . 's software engineering scale 's presented stuart . next 'll shortly afterwards ask question , yeah , thanks . wanted brieﬂy say early ﬂight want test ride latest development software could please speak colleague drop email take test ride . stuart , . ( video presentation ) 's actually clip longer 30-minute uninterrupted drive intervention navigating upon highway system production today hundred thousand car . 'm stuart i'm talk build many system scale , like really short induction 'm kind 'm coming , . 've couple company le 've writing software profession 12 year . thing excites 'm really passionate taking cutting edge machine learning actually connecting customer robustness scale . facebook , worked initially inside ad infrastructure build machinery learning , really really smart people . actually tried build single platform could scale aspect business rank news feed deliver search result make every recommendation across platform . became applied machine learning group , something incredibly proud lot n't core algorithm really important improvement happened matter , lot actually engineering practice build system scale thing true snap went really , really excited sort actually help monetize product . hardest part using google time effectively running u fairly small scale wanted build infrastructure , take understanding user , connect cutting edge machine learning , build massive scale handed billion trillion prediction auction every day really robust . opportunity came come tesla 's something 'm really incredibly excited specifically take amazing thing happening hardware side computer vision ai side actually package together planning , control , testing , kernel patching operating system continuous integration , simulation actually build product get onto people 's car production today . want talk timeline navigate autopilot 're going get navigate autopilot highway city street . 're 770 million mile already navigate autopilot . something really , really , really cool think one thing worth kind calling 're continuing accelerate keep learning data like andrej talked data engine accelerates , actually make assertive lane change , learning case intervene either failed detect merge correctly wanted car little peppy different environment . want keep making progress . start , begin trying understand world around u . talked different sensor vehicle . want like dig little bit . eight camera also additionally 12 ultrasonic sensor , radar , inertial measurement unit , gps , one thing forget also ( inaudible ) steering action . look 's happening around vehicle , look human chose interact environment . 'll talk clip right . basically showing 's happening today car 're continuing push forward . start single neural network . see detection around , build together multiple neural network multiple detection . bring sensor convert call vector space understanding world around u . something continue get better better 're moving logic neural network . obvious end game neural network look across car , brings information together ultimately output source truth world around u . actually like artist rendering since actually output one debugging tool use team everyday understand world look like around u . another thing think really exciting think hear sensor like lidar , common question around extra sensor modality like redundancy vehicle want dig one thing 's -- 's always obvious neural network . neural network running say wide fisheye camera , neural network making one prediction world . 's making many separate prediction actually audit . real example , ability detect pedestrian . 's something train carefully put lot work . also ability detect obstacle roadway pedestrian obstacle . 's shown differently neural network . say , oh , thing ca n't drive together combined give u increased sense ca n't front vehicle plan . across multiple camera overlapping field view many place around vehicle . front , particularly large number overlapping field view . lastly , combine thing like radar ultrasonics build extremely precise understanding 's happening front car . use learn future behavior accurate , also build accurate prediction thing continue happen front u . one example really exciting actually look bicyclist people ask going . actually heart next generation automatic emergency braking system stop people path , separate going path 's running shadow mode right . 'll go ﬂeet quarter . 'll talk shadow mode second . want start feature like navigate autopilot highway system , start learning data look human thing today , assertiveness profile , change lane , cause either abort change like maneuver see thing immediately obvious like , oh yes simultaneous merging rare , complicated important start build opinion different scenario fast overtaking vehicle . initially algorithm want try put ﬂeet see would done real world scenario car overtaking u quickly , taken actual simulation environment showing different path considered taking overlay real world behavior user . get algorithm tuned feel good specifically . really taking within neural network putting vector space building tuning parameter top . ultimately think machine learning , go controlled deployment u early access program . get couple thousand people really excited give highly vigilant useful feedback behaves open loop closed loop way real world watch intervention talk like somebody take actually get clip , try understand happens . one thing really actually play back open loop way ask . build software , getting closer farther human behave real world . one thing super cool full - elon r. musk - stuart bowersself-driving computer 're actually building rack infrastructure basically compete full self-driving computer fully wrapped build cluster actually run sophisticated data infrastructure actually understand time tune fix algorithm getting closer closer human behave ultimately exceed capability feel really good , want wide rollout . start actually asked everybody confirm car 's behavior via stock confirm , started making lot lot prediction navigating highway . asked people tell u , right wrong . chance turn data engine . spot really tricky interesting long tail -- case think really example like interesting case simultaneous merging start going somebody move either behind noticing . appropriate behavior tuning neural network need super precise appropriate behavior . worked , tuned background , made better . course time 've got nine million successfully accepted lane change use continuous integration infrastructure actually understand think 're ready one thing full self-driving really exciting since entire software stack , straight kernel patching , way ice bucket -- tuning image signal processor , start collect even data even accurate allows u even better better tuning faster iteration cycle . earlier month kind like -- 're ready deploy even seamless version navigate autopilot highway system . seamless version require stock confirms . sit , relax put hand wheel oversee car . case we're actually seeing 100,000 automated lane change every single day highway system . something like super cooled u point scale thing kind excited actual lifecycle actually turn data engine crank faster faster faster time . think one thing really becoming clear combination infrastructure built , tooling built top combined power full self-driving computer . believe even faster move autopilot highway system onto city street . 'll hand elon . best knowledge , lane change occurred zero accident . correct . yes watch every single accident . - elon r. musk - stuart bower - elon r. musk 's conservative obviously . 's hundred thousand going million lane change zero accident think great achievement team . thank . let 's see thing worth mentioning , order self-driving car robot taxi , really need redundancy throughout vehicle hardware level . starting , maybe october 2016 , car made tesla redundant power steering , redundant motor power steering , one failure -- motor fails , car still steer , power data line redundancy , sever given power line data line car keep driving . auxiliary power system even main pack , lose complete power main pack , car 's capable steering braking using auxiliary power system , completely lose main pack car safe . whole system hardware standpoint designed -- robot taxi since basically october 2016 , rolled hardware autopilot version two , expect upgrade car made , think would actually cost make new car upgrade car , give sense hard . unless designed , 's worth . 've gone future self-driving 's glitz , 's hardware , 's vision 's lot software 's -- software problem minimized massive software problem -- yes managing vast amount data , training data , control car based vision , 's diﬃcult software problem . going -- going like tesla master plan , obviously 've made bunch forward looking statement call let 's go forward-looking statement 've made , know way back , created company , separate tesla roadster , said impossible even build , nobody would buy . like universal opinion building electric car extremely dumb would fail . agreed probability failure high important . built tesla roadster ( inaudible ) 2008 shipping car . 's collector 's item . ( inaudible ) affordable car model , , , told 's impossible . called fraud liar going happen , untrue . okay . famous last word 're production model 2012 , exceeded expectation . still 2019 car compete model 2012. 's seven year later , still waiting would build affordable car highly affordable , affordable , affordable model 3. bought model 3. 're production . said 'd get 5000 car model 3 , point 5000 car week walk park u . 's even hard . large scale solar . ( inaudible ) acquisition would develop place solar roof going really well . 're version 3 solar tile roof expect spool production solar tile roof significantly later year . house 's great sort make power roll power pack . made power roll power pack , fact power pack deployed massive grid scale utility system around world including largest operating battery project world 100 megawatt next probably next year two year expect gigawatt scale battery project completed . thing said would , . . . we're going robot taxi thing . criticism 's fair one sometimes 'm time . get done tesla team get done . we're going year 're going reach combined production 10,000 week 6 3. feel confident feel confident future complete self-driving . next year , 'll expand product line model semi , expect first operating robot taxi next year one , next year . 's always diﬃcult like thing exponential -- exponential rate improvement , 's diﬃcult correct one 's mind around 're used extrapolating linear basis 've got massive amount like hardware -- massive hardware road cumulative data increasing exponentially software getting better exponential rate , feel confident predicting autonomous robot taxi tesla next year jurisdiction -- jurisdiction wo n't regulatory approval everywhere 'm confident 'll least regulatory approval somewhere literally next year . customer able add remove car tesla network . expect operate somewhat sort like combination maybe uber airbnb model . car add subtract tesla network tesla would take 25 % 30 % revenue place n't enough people sharing car would dedicated tesla vehicle . , use car 'll show ride sharing app , able summon car parking lot , get go drive . 's really simple take tesla app currently , 'll update app add summon tesla commit car ﬂeet . see summon car add -- summon tesla add -- add subtract car ﬂeet , 'll able phone . see potential smoothing demand pushing curve car operate much higher utility old car operator , like typically use car 10 hour 12 hour week . people drive 1.5 hour 2 hour day , typically 10 hour 12 hour week total driving . car operate autonomously , likely could probably -- likely could car operate third week longer . 168 hour week . probably 've got something order 55 hour 60 hour week operation , maybe bit longer , fundamental utility vehicle increase factor 5. look macroeconomic standpoint say like operating vague simulation , could upgrade simulation increase utility car factor 5 , would massive increase economic eﬃciency simulation , gigantic . 'll model 3 -- s3 x taxi , 've made important change lease . lease model 3 , n't option buying end lease . want back . buy car , keep , lease , give back . said , -- location 's enough supply sharing , tesla make car add network place . current cost model 3 robotaxi le $ 38,000 . expect number improve time resigning car , car currently built designed million mile operation . drive unit 's line test validated million mile operation . current battery pack maybe 300,000 mile 500,000 mile . new battery pack probably go production next year designed exclusively million mile operation . entire vehicle battery pack inclusive designed operate million mile minimal maintenance actually adjusting tyre design really optimizing car high proficient robotaxi . point , wo n't need steering wheel pedal 'll leave . thing become le le important , leave part , wo n't . say like , probably , two year , make car steering wheel pedal . need accelerate time , always delete part , easy . probably say long term , three year , robotaxis eliminated part , maybe end $ 25,000 le , want super eﬃcient car , electricity consumption low . 're currently 1.5 mile per kilowatt hour improve five beyond . really company full stack integration . 've got vehicle design manufacturing , 've got computer hardware in-house , 've got in-house software development ai , 've got far biggest suite . 's extremely diﬃcult , impossible perhaps extremely diﬃcult catch tesla 100 time mile per day everyone else combined . cost running gasoline car average cost running car u taken aaa . 's currently $ 0.62 mile . n't 1,000 mile 15 million vehicle . add 2 trillion year . literally taken aaa website . cost ridesharing according uber lyft $ 2 $ 3 mile . cost run robotaxi , think le $ 0.18 mile , dropping . like -- would current cost , future cost lower . say , would probable q - unidentified participant - unidentified speaker q - analyst - elon r. muskgross profit single robotaxi . think probably something order $ 30,000 per year , expect 're designing car way commercial semi-trailer -- semi truck designed . commercial semi-trucks designed million-mile life , 're designing car million-mile life well . nominal dollar would little $ 300,000 course 11 year , maybe higher . think consumption actually relatively conservative , assumes 50 % mile driven -- 's nothing useful . 50 % utility . middle next year 'll million tesla car road full self-driving hardware , feature complete reliably level would consider one need pay attention . meaning could go sleep -- standpoint , fast forward year , look maybe year , maybe year three month , next year sure . million robotaxis road . ﬂeet wake within year update , 's take . say net present value robotaxi , probably , order $ 200,000 . buying model 3 good deal . question ? well , mean , want ﬂeet , ﬂeet . ﬂeet , n't know , guess long-term , probably order 10 million vehicle . mean production rate generally -- look compound annual production rate since 2012 like -- 's first full year le production . went 23,000 vehicle produced 2013 around 250,000 vehicle produced last year . course five year , increased output factor 10. would expect something similar occurs next five six year . sharing , sharing versus n't know . nice thing essentially customer fronting u money car . 's great . term one thing snake charger , 'm curious also determine pricing ? look like 're undercutting average lyft uber ride 50 % . 'm curious could talk little bit pricing strategy ? sure . would expect -- solving snake charger , 's pretty straightforward vision standpoint . 's like known situation . kind known situation vision like charge port trivial . yes , car would automatically park automatically plug . would one -- human supervision required . yes , q - colin rusch - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. muskso pricing . threw number . mean think definitely plug whatever pricing think make sense . 're kind randomly said okay maybe $ 1 . thing like 's -- 's like order 2 billion car truck world . robotaxis extremely high demand long time . observation , far auto industry slow adapt . mean like said there's still car road buy today good model 2012. suggests pretty slow rate adaptation car industry probably $ 1 conservative next 10 year , also sort think like -- 's like actually enough appreciation diﬃculty manufacturing . manufacturing insanely diﬃcult . lot people talk think like , right design like instantly make much thing world want . true . extremely hard design new manufacturing system new technology . mean audi major problem manufacturing e-tron extremely good manufacturing . 're problem others . order 2 billion car truck world , order 100 million unit per year production capacity vehicle , old design , take long time convert full self-driving car , really need electric cost operation gasoline diesel car much higher electric car . robotaxi n't electric absolutely competitive . elon , 's colin rusch oppenheimer . obviously , appreciate customer fronting cash ﬂeet getting built , sound like massive balance sheet commitment organization course time . talk little bit look like ? expectation term financing next call three year , three four year building ﬂeet starting monetize customer base ? 're aiming beat approximately cash ﬂow neutral ﬂeet build phase , expected extremely cash ﬂow positive robotaxis enabled . n't want talk financing round , would diﬃcult financing round venue , think 'll make right move . think 'll make move think make . question , 'm uber , would n't buy car ? would let put business ? 's clause put car . think three four year ago . used tesla network . q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participantso even private person like go buy 10 model 3 , ca n't -- run network 's business , right . 're allowed use tesla network . right . use tesla network theory could run car showing robotaxi business 10 model 3 . yes , 's like app store -- add -- add remove tesla network tesla get revenue share . 's similar airbnb though home car rent , make extra income owning multiple car renting . like model 3 , aspire get roadster next , build 'm going rent model 3 , would give back ? guess could operate rental car ﬂeet , think unwieldy . yes . n't know , seems easy . okay . try . order operate robotaxi network , sound like solve certain problem like example auto pilot today steer let take . 's ridesharing product someone else getting passenger seat , like moving steering ca n't let person take car example , might even driver seat . hardware already robotaxi might get situation cop pulling human might need intervene . like using central ﬂeet operator remotely sort interact human mean type infrastructure already built car ? make sense ? - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - pete bannon q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk think sort phone home thing , car get stuck phone home tesla ask solution . thing like pulled -- police oﬃcer , 's easy u program 's problem . possible somebody take using steering wheel least period time probably road , 'll cap steering wheel , 's steering control . 'll take steering wheel put cap give like couple year . hardware modification car order enable ? yes . 'll literally unbolt steering wheel put cap steering wheel handle currently . like future car would put . today 's car steering wheel mechanism take autopilot . like , 's robotaxi mode would someone able take simply moving steering wheel type ? yes . think 'll transition period people able take able take robotaxi . regulator comfortable u steering wheel , 'll delete . car -- ﬂeet , obviously permission owner , owned somebody else , would take steering wheel put cap steering wheel currently touch . might like two phase robotaxi . one , service provided come driver could potentially take future might driver option . see well like ... future , wo n't -- future -- probability steering wheel taken away future 100 % . consumer demand . initially would ... q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - analyst - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. muskthis -- -- want clear . proscribing point view world . predicting consumer demand . yes consumer demand future people allowed drive two ton death machine . totally totally agree . order model 3 today part robotaxi network call , would get driver seat essentially safe . 's right . make sense . thank , bye . exactly . thank . sort like amphibian pretty much thing become like land creature . little bit surviving amphibian phase . hi . strategy 've heard player robotaxi space select certain municipal area create geo-fenced self-driving way 're using hd map confined area bit safety . ) n't hear much today around importance hd map . extent hd map necessary . second , also n't hear much deploying specific municipality 're working municipality get buy 're also getting defined area . 's importance hd map extent looking specific municipality rollout ? think hd map mistake . actually hd map . actually can't count , either need hd map case anything change environment , car break n't need hd map case 're wasting time hd map . hd map thing like two main crutch -- used wo n't -- retrospect , retrospect obviously false foolish lidar hd map . mark word . q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. muskhello . need geo-fenced area , n't real self-driving . , sound like maybe battery supply could bottleneck left towards vision . also could clarify get battery pack last million mile ? think cell constraint , 's subject whole separate -- 's whole separate subject . think 're actually going want push u sort standard range plus battery long range battery energy content long range pack 50 % higher kilowatt hour . , essentially , make third car -- sort stand range plus instead long range pack , 's one like around 50 kilowatt hour , older one around 75 kilowatt hour . 're actually calling bias , sale intentionally towards smaller battery pack order higher volume -- basically -- obvious next thing think maximize number autonomous unit number -- maximize output subsequently result biggest autonomously road . making -- number thing regard , 's today 's meeting . million mile life , ... million mile-life basically getting cycle life pack -- need basically , order , like say 've got basic math , got 250 mile range pack , 're going need 4,000 cycle . achievable . already stationary storage , stationary storage solution like power pack , ready play power pack 4,000 cycle life capability . ask ... sorry . q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participanti want ask ... like ventriloquism . 's obviously significantly constructive margin implication extent drive attach rate much higher full self-driving option . 'd curious level u kind term attach rate expect educate consumer robotaxi scenario attach rate materially improve time ? sorry 's bit hard hear question . yeah , -- curious today term full self-driving attach rate term financial implication ? think 's hugely beneficial attach rate materially increase higher gross margin dollar ﬂow extent people sign full fst . curious see ramping ? attach rate today versus expect -- expect educate consumer get aware attaching fst vehicle purchase ? going ramp massively today . yes . mean fundamental -- really fundamental message consumer taking today financially insane buy anything tesla . like owning horse three year . mean , fine n't horse go expectation . buy car -- hardware necessary full self-driving , like buying horse . car hardware necessary full self-driving tesla . like really think purchase vehicle . 's basically crazy buy car tesla . need make -- convey augment clearly today . perfect . thanks bringing future present informational time today . wondering like talk much tesla pickup let give context . could wrong way 'm looking tesla network , early adopter something test bread , think tesla 's pick maybe first phase - elon r. musk q - colin langan - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participantof putting vehicle network , utility tesla pickup would pretty much people either loading lot stuff profession construction little odd item , like picking stuff home depot . would say maybe need two stage process , pickup truck , exclusively tesla network starting point people like buy later . thought ? well today really autonomy . 's lot could talk cell production , pickup truck future vehicle , today focus autonomy . agree 's major thing . 'm excited tesla pickup truck unveiling year . 's going great . colin langan , ubs . understand definition , refer feature complete self-driving sound like 're talking level 5 geo- fence what's expected end year thing . regulatory process . mean talked regulator ? seems quite aggressive timeline people put . mean -- hurdle needed timeline get approval need thing like california , 're tracking mile -- operator line need thing . process going look like ? yes . talked regulator around world time , introduce additional feature like navigate autopilot , -- requires like regulatory approval project jurisdiction basis . , think fundamentally , regulator experience convinced data . massive amount data show autonomy safe , listen . may take time digest information . process may take bit time , always come right conclusion 've seen . question . 's got light eye pillar . okay . wanted -- work 've done trying better understand ride hail market . look like 's concentrated major dense urban center . way think robo taxi would probably deploy area , additional full self driving personally vehicle would suburban area ? - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant think like probably , yes , like tesla owned robo taxi would dense urban area along customer vehicle . get medium low density area would tend people car occasionally lend . ( inaudible ) yes . lot edge case manhattan say downtown san francisco , -- various area around world challenging urban environment . expect significant issue . say feature complete mean work downtown san francisco downtown manhattan year . hi . neural net architecture question . use different model say path planning perception different type ai sort split problem across different piece autonomy . well essentially -- right ai neural net use really object recognition 're still basically using still frame . identifying object still frame tying together perception path planning layer thereafter . what's happening steadily neural net kind heating software base . time expect neural net computational cost standpoint thing simple heuristic diﬃcult neural net . probably make sense maintain level heuristic system 're computationally thousand time easier neural net . neural net like cruise missile . try swat ﬂy , use ﬂy swatter , cruise missile . overtime would expect move really training video , video-in car steering pedal basically video lateral longitudinal acceleration , almost entirely , last 's 're going use dojo system . 's system currently . maybe . going back sensor suite discussion -- one area 'd like talk lack side radar situation intersection stop sign 's maybe 35 mile 40 mile per hour cross traﬃc . comfortable sensor suite side camera able handle ? maybe talk ? - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk yes . problem . essentially car going kind human would . like think human like basically camera slow gimbal . 's quite remarkable people able drive car way . - - ca n't look direction . car literally look direction multiple camera . human able drive sort looking way looking way 're actually stuck driver 's seat . ca n't really get driver seat . 's kind one camera gimbal able drive , conscientious driver drive high safety . camera car better advantage point person . they're like b pillar front rear view mirror . 've really got great vantage point . turning road 's got lot high speed traﬃc , quest 's like gradual like turn little bit go fully road let camera see 's going . thing look good rear camera n't show oncoming traﬃc go , look sketchy pull back little bit like person . behavior like remarkably , start become remarkably lifelike . 's like quite eerie actually . good car start behaving like person . . go . ventriloquist right . okay . given value 're creating auto business wrapping technology around , guess 'm curious would still taking cell capacity putting power wall power pack would n't make sense put every single unit make part business ? 've already stolen almost cell line 're meant go power power pack use model 3. mean last year order make model 3 production cell starved , convert 2170 line gigafactory car cell . -- actual output total gigawatt hour stationary storage compared vehicle order magnitude different . stationary storage , basically use whole bunch miscellaneous cell . gather cell -- multiple supplier around world , n't homologation issue safety issue like car . 's basically -- stationary battery business kind beating scrap quite . like -- everything like production , many , many constraint massive production system . 's like degree manufacturing supply chain underappreciated amazing . whole series constraint . constraint one week , may q - adam jonas - elon r. musk q - adam jonas - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participantconstraint another week . 's insanely diﬃcult make car , especially one rapidly evolving . yeah . 'll take question , , think break , cut car . hi elon , adam jonas . question safety . data share u today , safe technology , obviously important regulatory insurance discussion . published accident per mile every quarter , see right autopilot twice safe normal driver average , expect increase quite bit time . like said , future , consumer want outlaw , n't think succeed saying agree position . future , consumer want outlaw people driving car , 's unsafe . thing like elevator , elevator use operated big lever , like go ﬂoor , 's like big relay , yet elevator operator , periodically would get tired drunk something would turn lever wrong time sever somebody half . tell elevator operator , would quite alarming went elevator big lever could move ﬂoors arbitrarily . 's button . long-term , value judgment , 'm saying want world way , 'm saying consumer likely demanded -- people live broadcast . elon , follow . share u much tesla 's spending autopilot autonomous technology , order magnitude annual basis ? thank . 's basically entire expense structure . question economics tesla network . understand , look like , get model 3 lease . $ 25,000 go balance sheet would asset . -- would cash ﬂow $ 30,000 year , roughly way think ? yes . ( multiple speaker ) something like , yeah . term financing , 's question earlier mentioned would . cash ﬂow neutral robo-taxi program ? cash ﬂow neutral - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participanttesla whole . sorry . cash ﬂow neutral ... term -- asked question financing robo-taxi yet . look like 're self financing . , mentioned would basically cash ﬂow neutral . 're referring ? think robo-taxis fully deployed throughout world , sensible thing u maximize rate drive company cash ﬂow neutral . okay , item ... robo-taxi ﬂeet active , would expect extremely cash ﬂow positive . -- talking production . yeah . produce . okay thanks . maximize number autonomous unit made . thank . guess , maybe one last question . - elon r. musk - pete bannonhi , add tesla robo-taxi network , liable accident ? tesla ? vehicle accident harm somebody . mean , 's probably tesla . 's probably tesla . think right thing make sure , accident . alright . thanks everyone . please enjoy price . thank . thank , much .
