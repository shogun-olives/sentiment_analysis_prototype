's good thing uber option . would suggest everybody take look know number shaping seatrip.com thing snap back booking expedia thing meituan china thing shape food delivery guy china obviously three month four month ahead recovery likely sooner 's best look metric company get sense going play u . really quickly valuation risk , think valuation risk low point ride sharing food delivery guy given valuation come quite bit really think key indicator trip frequency , see bounce back trip frequency , think 's good set-up company . , pas julie payment . thanks , mandeep . yeah , hi , 's julie chariell . ran scenario fintech payment company may impacted slowdown spending . 'll walk methodology shortly , let first give key takeaway . first , discretionary spending clearly heading way lead slower tpv revenue growth first half likely slower eps growth . mean , hard cut cost meaningfully downturn seems likely short-lived . depending company group geographic business mix , revenue growth could slow 4 point 14 point year eps could drop 2 % to.9 % . , second , think 's merchant acquirer like global payment fiserv well square could high end negative range . seems bit like lot consensus call , global payment fiserv nearly two-thirds revenue tied merchant card processing , discretionary spending card likely start slowing across board , right , 're moving beyond ﬂights hotel cruise kind entertainment sporting event , theater , restaurant retail . yet reﬂected guidance management commentary . ability work home pretty amazing advance , doubt 's best way extract integration synergy mega merger stay plan . importantly , week ago , good company little exposure asia , think 's going turn negative 2q , region lone grower . asia , particularly china seems least past worst coronavirus outbreak . people factory starting get back work . conversely , shutdown started europe u obviously coronavirus case yet reached peak . possible asia rebound could mitigating factor earnings pressure visa mastercard , nearly 30 % revenue asia , third , stock continue fall earnings estimate reasonably adjusted downward . far , weighted average reduction 2020 eps coverage universe year-to-date 1.5 % . see share loss low-to-high single digit range estimate come , bear market sentiment really prevails start seeing greater multiple contraction even factoring second half recovery 2021 growth , stock price decline reach mid-to- high teen . lastly , think paypal maybe best relative performer , cross-border business already impacted company announced small growth shortfall , expect get worse 25 % revenue , social distancing , seems even people buying online merchant 's paypal 's core customer base . long product remains available delivery continue , paypal 's merchant customer maybe busiest far . let show assumption behind number . three scenario . first two deal fundamental focused tpv region impact discretionary portion tpv . tpv total payment volume , total amount spent card digital mean . base case seemed like worst case week ago , may light , assumes 20 % 30 % tpv decline couple month . scenario two assumes deeper decline longer , 50 % decline discretionary spending card assume last june u europe . third scenario worst case look market slipping extended bear territory possibly prolonged impact lack optimism swift substantial rebound . assumes multiple compression lower 2021 eps . specific described slide , wo n't restate , impact stock would tough . 's 13 % 20 % decline . jitendra warallet show impact assumption number . see along left side , split coverage four segment . card processor , large merchant acquirer merged six company three company last year . see term revenue growth slowdown eps decline , global payment fiserv downside risk along square . reason discussed earlier . interesting , fidelity national fis , le impacted half exposure merchant card processing . card network , visa mastercard , similar tpv risk processor , could also see card issuing service revenue slowdown bank derisking kind scenario . impact could muted scale global reach includes exposure asia , seems mend . wex fleetcor 20 % 30 % business tied corporate travel expensing , know practically grounded halt . estimate already come average larger exposure trucking may actually supported rise logistics need , lower fuel price though could add top line pressure . lastly , pure fintechs , square paypal , square small merchant base comprised many restaurant , could hit hardest long downturn virtually exposure asia , potential growth leg 2q . paypal , see , lowest potential growth eps impact 're right impact confined around 25 % business supporting cross-border payment , company look relatively well insulated . lastly , valuation look company . potential stock impact really lower eps , multiple hold , downside mostly contained single-digit percentage , , 's highest -- highest number processor , lowest paypal . , bear market sentiment take hold broader market multiple begin contract , even investor looking toward normalized 2021 , share face another big drop . , 'm going hand colleague , jitendra waral , internet . thank , julie . good morning , everybody . 'm jitendra waral , cover internet sector . uncertainty space high , fact , sheryl sandberg , coo facebook , yesterday bloomberg tv said , nobody predict marketing impact point term extent impact . take cue happened china exactly sort like mean internet space general , positive negative . first touch advertising , sector widespread impact vertical everybody talked . expectation internet changed sort reﬂects visibility problem , china , internet space seen double-digit decline 1q expectation . expect similar thing happen 2q u name . multiple -- three basic way impact really come . number one travel , travel hard hit , hardest hit sector , 's 8 % industry general . exposure varies company . google higher exposure search , 11 % , display , would reﬂect facebook , 's 6 % . travel , seeing company taking spending 25 % plus travel segment would ripple impact company . aspect , really captured expectation valuation matter , impact automotive financial service , 12 % industry sale . sort add three vertical , 30 % plus exposure ad revenue coming large internet company would show essentially second quarter company reporting give u guidance . ad growth slowdown 1h going bigger impact estimate facebook , 's going upwards $ 2 billion . google , 's going $ 3 billion . continues potentially part 2h advertising coming back online different sector different pace , given three vertical might move slowly back , expect like impact sort continue 3q , hope rightful step company taking minimize impact second half could taper hit near end . aspect advertising , important event cancellation . , particular , important twitter twitter become largely event-driven company recent year key event like olympics risk , would significant impact twitter 's revenue growth expectation . biggest unknown really internet sector advertising general google , facebook remains small medium business , small medium business pretty much lifeblood company term growth closure seeing right raise uncertainty impact could . 's think like looking chinese internet company based face closure could give u idea , believe double-digit decline going happen second quarter . e-commerce , one interesting demand spiking across board . seeing amazon , apps e-commerce general sort like get higher demand amazon hiring 100,000 people service demand . help revenue growth offset , may , demand people working home trying shore capacity , 's different time really cost logistics go . historically , seen capacity overwhelmed , cost go , amazon raising compensation current workforce rightfully cost $ 350 million incremental hiring 100,000 people support spike demand may also come additional cost . believe happening year , look amazon 's business general , everything excluding aws anurag ranaexpected operating margin 2.2 % , pretty much ﬂat 2019. n't believe number hit , might actually come close 0 % scenario . one positive see sector really cloud utilization sensitive measure cloud , work home drive usage across board , going see margin uptick . amazon said early 2019 every single percentage point increase utilization lead ten million dollar saving . would see higher utilization work home online engagement actually benefit sort create offset internet company exposed trend cloud perspective . valuation ? valuation actually dipped 2015 level . feel sum total , 're seeing double-digit decline expectation first half , high-single digit whole year . look valuation , reﬂecting , sharp decline 2015 low perspective , n't really capture recession scenario , one reference point 'll give google -- google 's growth slowed single-digits 2009 happened . uncertain unknown thing second half would sort dip double digit , 's know . company strongest balance sheet world , 70 % world 's online population using service every month . 're getting exposed new feature , use case like whatsapp business , grocery whole food , verily google . secular tailwind driving double-digit growth internet sector , expect pause , wo n't stop longer term . expect weather storm , double-digit growth curve internet sector resume next year . hopefully , give perspective internet sector . , pas anurag rana view software . thank , jitendira . perspective , 's bit different seen sector , largely least near term , going -- virus going le impact stuff 's already booked , especially company large support revenue large subscription base . typically happens , revenue 's already book , 's matter ﬂowed income statement . far virus concerned , impact see going area deal cycle elongated . new product sale , far could say expectation going next month could okay may bad saw case oracle , actually slightly better people expected . bigger kicker would could see new product sale suffer would reﬂect case license sale well new cloud sale . two area think going see first sign slowdown . case cloud-based company , could see impact revenue performance obligation number , number ﬂows revenue next 12 month 24 month . one area think could see kind -- could say , boost going , demand boost collaboration software , talk slack , talk microsoft team . 'm sure everybody 's talked ad nauseam zoom number downloads gone . end day , software industry providing productivity tool consumer enterprise , think could drive growth going -- coming particular problem , short term , think , think , company provide collaboration software could see leg . , want brieﬂy discus valuation . looked valuation come compared last four year five year , frankly moved area going back '09-'10 level . jump service world , wanted take minute go bigger name cover see think 're going fare next couple quarter . 'm starting microsoft , example , looking microsoft fairly sizable , let 's say , stable commercial base . think annuity commercial base closer 80 % , 90 % company sign enterprise sign long-term agreement microsoft provide -- microsoft provide product . microsoft fairly stable commercial business , consumer business one could see weakness area could see case one segment called pc area could see hardware sale problem , similar anand said , supply chain concern , microsoft already pulled guidance division . 's think see impact . going area , cloud business , transactional part , think able hold utilizing cloud-based application , would see lot transaction go . stable nature subscription provided oﬃce 365 , stable element . second big company oracle , reported thing looked okay , fact reported better number people expected . case oracle , large support base . big issue behind cloud , able migrate lot database , guess silver lining , also provided , large support base get recurring revenue actually holding right . subscription base , fusion cloud product , 's also holding . moving sap , company think high europe exposure could think one software company could see downside sale eps revision going next quarter even high exposure europe well also run product called ariba , fair amount transaction revenue ﬂows le subscription nature . moving vmware , company see weakness license sale . support base largely , 's large virtualization software , able offset risk . salesforce.com , company also done fair amount good work , would say , stable subscription nature , acquired couple company last two year think help mitigate organic slowdown new business signing also encounter , given diverse product portfolio , think le insulated single product company , brings u workday . workday bit issue come , core hcm product slowing biggest hope , next future growth , pinned cloud-based erp solution that's area think 's possibly given big commitment company , given disruption 's going , maybe take bit back seat near future . said , think workday 's prospect coming -- 's also one company superior product -- area service . last two company software cover , shopify adobe , fairly hard -- fairly large exposure consumer-related product , one could see either could say pull-back spending . moving onto service , think area 's going le impact . nevertheless , see stuff well . within tech service name , think consulting one get affected outsourcing , largely discretionary nature consulting work , get impacted . company larger european exposure capgemini one impacted . given bank spend lot service given 's happening interest rate last week , think bank spending likely going get weaker next 12 month . even offshore work immune slowdown . offshore company cognizant , tc , infosys depend lot banking spending could see slowdown growth rate , one thing remember almost service company , going year , typically 90 % revenue already locked . think still better protected company tech ecosystem , u , area would watching closely would booking number going next quarter see come . , within service space , think accenture one company much , would say , well diversified business model . see last -- last time looked accenture , going back '09-'10 time-frame , could see revenue fell quite bit , think different company point , le impact individual company well-diversified business model , unique way acquiring small entity scaling , large digital footprint , large global offshore footprint . think would , comparative basis , le impact accenture would rest space . john butlernow , , 'm going pas along colleague , john butler , telecom . ( technical diﬃculty ) cover telecom equipment vendor . see first chart , consensus revenue estimate eps sector really come lot think lot reﬂects fact telecom relatively immune really sizable impact virus . said , let start apple provide thought think 's going play . think number one , important thing keep mind apple lost sale second quarter third quarter going lost forever , majority apple 's device business really represents upgrade opposed organic growth . sense 'll see pushouts maybe fourth quarter even next year . lost sale lost forever . 'm running base case scenario total impact quarter next , fiscal second third quarter apple . base case scenario suggests $ 0.50 impact eps , roughly $ 7 billion $ 10 billion -- likely mostly postponed sale opposed lost sale . big issue quarter centered china impacted demand also supply shock . good news rate new infection china beginning recede . bad news , demand impact evolving western market , particularly europe , u . best guess , 's -- 're probably going follow similar bell curve china , think sudden change behavior state western europe social distancing , advent warmer weather come starting may really going help quell spread think largely confine 2q 3q . shifting look 's impacted apple 's valuation , many know , apple 25 % high . look back early january , stock trading 24 time forward four quarter pe ratio . chart suggests 're headed back mean 15 time 16 time . , 's sort fear- driven trading environment . 's diﬃcult say whether overshoot . think concern really getting baked almost worst-case scenario state . switching gear telecom . think title say , telecom relatively immune virus impact . overall , expect quarantining forth , maybe 2 % impact annual sale . carrier , good news high-margin service revenue really benefit work-at-home trend , equipment sale could get dented carrier beginning close retail store , particularly mall-based store . 're going much lower foot traﬃc , though would emphasize equipment sale lower margin service business -- pardon , represent much smaller percent total revenue . q - mandeep singh q - julie chariellone question get lot , virus really derail deployment 5g service u ? think best answer , maybe , could see potential labor shortage , get broad outbreak state . already shortage tower climber call , folk climb tower put spectrum service equipment -- service cell tower . , think , boost sick leave among labor force could lead shortage worker , course , risk equipment shortage well , net-net , expectation risk modest impact . think get second half , 're back full steam ahead . taking look telecom valuation , see , 've come market . , term business insulated virus , telecom along utility good get . , really service based revenue model . , let sort close portion discussion quick thought wireless equipment vendor , including nokia ericsson . coming quarter faced supply risk china getting critical component make gear . bit demand side risk . , much smaller comparison . ericsson also faced much higher risk china nokia , bigger business . think good news point rate new infection china dropping rapidly 're getting back business think supply constraint begin ease coming month opposed get worse . happen equipment sale may get dented new network construction u europe slows lot sick leave among workforce . mind , 've modeled base case scenario 5 % risk revenue . overall , , think fallout two name modest , , good news lot factory getting back work -- getting back work china . , let turn back mandeep q & . question answer thank , john . may time couple question . julie , 're , talk cross-border payment exposure top company like visa mastercard ? sure , thanks mandeep . visa mastercard n't provide specific amount revenue tpv cross-border transaction . best estimate 've seen somewhere 5 % 7 % . provide growth though every quarter tell visa past year cross-border grown slightly lower q - mandeep singh q - geetha ranganathan q - mandeep singh q - anand srinivasanthan corporate average , mastercard , 's grown slightly higher , visit cross-border could accrue bit mastercard visa , thing slow , still seems well le 10 % tpv . got . thank , julie . geetha , really quick , discus subscriber growth tailwind streaming company like netﬂix , hulu , disney result covid-19 ? sure , mandeep . obviously big boost streaming service . ran number . people get shut , obviously 're streaming . actually ran number february mobile downloads asia region netﬂix saw 30 % increase expect similar increase u march . thing though , even subscriber tailwind , couple thing need factor . debate really company like netﬂix , instance , 's really like all-you-can-eat buffet even people spending like four hour netﬂix , necessarily ? ad revenue . translate significant increase revenue ? probably , think , people want go simultaneous streaming , 's probably going upgrade expensive tier .
