're still muted , colette . sorry . right . give u minute . go . . muted . . let try . hear ? got . quintessential 2020-2021 start meeting . sorry . 're sure moved . thank much nvidia conference . agree , next year another great year . hopefully person . christopher caso colette m. kress - christopher caso - colette m. kress guess would like start u start anything want say . 'll work q & . colette , 'll leave however want get u started . okay . sound great . need give quick little reminder everybody presentation discussion may contain forward-looking statement , investor advised read report filed sec information related risk , uncertainty facing business . get way let kind talk , 've finished earnings last week , completed q4 full year fiscal year '21 released result . truly breakout year u , accelerated computing gaming . adoption accelerated computing across industry high gear , see gaming moved beyond game , incorporating esports , creatives really social medium u . incredible demand geforce rtx 30 series , best launch ever . kicked powerful upgrade cycle u . adoption nvidia 's accelerated computing continues gather momentum . greater urgency across many company digest , automate accelerate innovation move forward . talk result . great finish fiscal year '21 huge guide guided q1 fiscal year '22 well . 'll turn back , chris . question answer well 's good way start u . strong guidance . 's maybe first question , going common lot semiconductor company week aspect shortage . 's mind every semiconductor investor right . perhaps could tell u nvidia affected shortage . would demand better supply ? dealing ? sure . really think business , think really start statement , word supply , really word , demand . demand strong . demand strong across business launching ampere architecture gaming data center . building , example , overall gaming business , building gpus gaming samsung tsmc . ability source overall gaming business 2 high-level fabs . could n't pleased great partner 've u many year . allow u produce everything need high end also $ 300 price point , still able produce overall - christopher caso - colette m. kress - christopher caso - colette m. kresssupply provider tsmc . overall turing architecture end year . summary , although , overall , short demand , still believe supply deliver continued growth year gaming data center . one thing mentioned call also 're going -- 're process launching mainstream series , next version ampere 3060. talk supply product well impact go forward april quarter ? yes . let 's step back talk 30 series . 's correct . launched overall gaming gpu 30 series earlier last year . huge success , probably successful gaming launch . second-generation rtx , stand ray tracing also list 3 dozen game overall ray tracing strong performance improvement 30 series , demand amazing . started launch product , starting several high-end card , 3070 3080 3090 market several overall month . period time , showing capability 30 series , true gamers , also supporting availability creator broadcaster use . expect see 30 series continue launch new product move forward . latest product launched 3060. 60 class sweet spot . sweet spot gamers , great performance great price . 60 class essentially preferred icafes 'll find asia pac area well many system builder build custom overall system . 3060 's launch last week . sold hour . carefully engineered gamers primarily gamers , excited . ampere architecture $ 329 . great differentiation price point support type gamer depending want come market pay . well cost new console . mentioned pricing , one difference 30 series compared 20 series well , launch 3090 higher price point . maybe talk , n't disclose asp within . maybe speak qualitatively impact higher-priced card 's done overall mix within gaming . yes . start launch architecture higher-end card , similar last time , think well received across market , ability ray tracing , think important upgrade cycle u , see astounding amount performance - christopher caso - colette m. kress - christopher caso - colette m. kressimprovement , last architecture . go back architecture pascal importance pascal term installed base . upgrader pascal and/or turing see tremendous performance improvement expansion overall ray trace gain really holiday season truly benefited upgrading well new gamers coming market . volume skus , 3060 , given interest many gamers even volume skus moving 3070 , 3080 , helped u term average asp , total revenue whole . likely continue see driver u . okay . 's good . demand strong , move back supply side moment . talk availability supply , particularly go year . historically , say july quarter little seasonally weaker desktop side . go back half year , get stronger . would imagine thing -- supply -- demand ahead supply , 's constraint . perhaps seasonality play depends upon availability wafer go along . expect get additional wafer year progress ? yes . let 's step back think talk term end q4 . end q4 , great holiday season . super strength term demand overall . correctly , channel -- channel inventory lean level time . look overall guide moving q4 q1 , seasonality essentially thrown window super strong sequential increase expected q4 q1 gaming . working always supply . 'll continue get supply throughout q1 well rest year meet demand quite strong . seasonality , therefore , changed q1 . probably , therefore , change think whole rest year . 'll see rest year go guide 1 quarter time . seasonality 've seen past probably going able repeat 're able move overall level channel appropriate level . right . sound like n't feel constraint supply -- mean still may constrained , n't necessarily constrain ability grow level . 's additional supply coming . demand , . still get growth . yes , absolutely , chris . , course situation would love optionality . would love overall supply . remember , issue , demand strong . demand strong , believe grow quite well demand continue year front u . - christopher caso - colette m. kress - christopher caso - colette m. kress yes . 've observed looking card retail . 're hard get . certainly , data . go website corroborate 're saying . factor , 's obviously concern investor impact cryptocurrency business right , fear -- cryptocurrency business , think said call , 're expecting sort permanent element demand going forward . 's volatile gaming demand . maybe could talk view step 're taking control risk . yes . step back understand crypto understand crypto currency time around , environment different , different last cycle . first , gaming architecture 30 series early ramp versus early stage transition took placed back 2018. 've discussed , channel lean 30 series right . secondly , keep mind de-hashing , reducing overall mining performance latest 60 series gpu announced cmp board , specifically miner . announced cmp board felt saw demand professional miner , would good opportunity u restart cmp program . thirdly , etherium mining increase occurred shared lot different overall driver . remember , established installed base ethereum time around versus 2018. 're also seeing new asics part lot hashing occurring , multiple gpu provider time . quarter gaming , example , probably would without crypto 're supply constrained . 'll continue watch . believe cmp product allow u better visibility understanding size crypto within quarter . could go back within -- 2018 20 cycle , release mining specific board time also . n't , 'd say aggressive approach 're actually de-hashing 3060. suppose -- take step higher end 30 series card . safe say going forward , one strategy employ segment crypto part , gaming part market , make sure gaming card get gamers crypto , address like ? yes . correct . 've announced cmp program , start shipping march time frame . additionally , 3060 came , opportunity u allow available gamers . build geforce gamers . took additional step reduce hash rate eﬃciency - christopher caso - colette m. kress - christopher caso - colette m. kressnew launch 3060 , n't see need take step 30 series card launched last fall crypto mining n't really happening far back . support gamers , support gamers geforce really create cmp card professional miner . that's 'll see next quarter , 'll update everybody quarter term saw term cryptocurrency cmp . 'll ask one gaming . ( operator instruction ) far gaming general , suppose 's one market segment , could say one work-from- home , learned-from-home , be-at-home beneficiary 9-year-old next room definitely evidence . -- term exceptional demand 're seeing gaming , deal potential risk go outside thing demand tail . yes . look perspective gaming moved . gaming continued grow entertainment social medium . also served important connection many u last year perfect virtual safe option entertainment . anything , believe past year accelerated discovery gaming growth preferred entertainment social medium time . expect continued growth occur even thing possibly get better people able thing social medium . hooked gaming , hooked friend , overall social aspect gaming , 's going really diﬃcult turn back . still think great opportunity expose people overall gaming . see overall demand , expect continue work home . great . well 'll attest , , winning fortnite match son probably best bonding opportunity covid . -- n't think go back . 'll pivot data center . data center growing . 's modest growth 've seen gaming , least short term , long term . maybe talk business going , extent data center business also constrained shortage . yes . let 's look data center business finish fiscal year '21 . fiscal year '21 record level total company . 've discussed , record number gaming . also record finish data center business . year launching ampere gaming , launched ampere architecture data center , starting term launch even lockdown associated pandemic . true successful year u . q4 also record . q4 , data center business grew industry whole grow . additionally , guiding growth q1 , industry also planning sequentially 20 % . feel really great - christopher caso - colette m. kress - christopher caso - colette m. kressaccelerated computing , ai , overall inclusion mellanox networking business . still ramping overall a100 expanded great set diverse customer launch -- overall launch a100 . hyperscales cloud still ramping . also added customer vertical industry . case broad-based strength across csps , vertical industry continue support enterprise , use accelerated computing ai . 've gotten great momentum dgxs , csps well vertical industry . we'll continue see growth q1 today . think data center business still growth driver year come . colette , -- 's split on-premise versus hyperscale part data center business ? obviously on-premise one area covid impacted . enterprise spending general ? weaker . true business well ? extension , expect enterprise get better people go back oﬃces , materialize data center business also ? yes . hyperscales important part business u many year . initial start ai accelerated computing really birthed overall hyperscale partner , ramping a100 . hyperscale business whole le 50 % data center business . enterprise vertical represent 50 % . important piece multiple way attract vertical industry enterprise . cloud instance , new form adopt computing platform new wave accelerated computing . hyperscale cloud provider quickly deployed overall a100 cloud instance . way enterprise test get comfortable new architecture continue buy on-premise basis continue keep overall cloud . seen strength many year working term building software sdks meet need accelerated computing application . moved era ampere architecture , growth customer set , hyperscales , , strong enterprise presence . expect grew faster industry well enterprise acceleration ai still important , even though economy may challenge time . follow-on data center , 'll read one question came dpu part data center market . question , entirely incremental opportunity ? cannibalization gpu data center 're going compute sort -- dpu . - christopher caso - colette m. kress - christopher caso - colette m. kressyes . let start discussing dpu . work together mellanox plus nvidia , working together create opportunity acceleration data center beyond gpu acceleration . looking include networking software-defined networking .
