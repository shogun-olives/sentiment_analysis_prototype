's great . great see . yes . actually first in-person conference three year . 's -- 's first conference three year . 's lot . question answer - jensen huang ( question answer ) yes . maybe , jensen , let 's start high level . field ai , important problem solve ? hard problem solve ? think gpu right way solve ? see number approach , whether custom silicon , right , whether 's fpgas , right , company making gpus also . important problem ? hard problem ? think approach best one ? one question ? 's going take 40 minute . 's excellent question . 's important question . first , machine learning , artificial intelligence computer writes software . writes software human write . look pattern relationship data . creates model infer make prediction data see future n't seen . , think said , characteristic machine learning -- 's computer writes , writes software normal human make prediction future , 've got ask important , would apply , kind problem finally solve first time ca n't write type software , principled mathematics , principled equation make prediction , like , example , 's maxwell 's law , 's newton 's law , none law exist , schrodinger 's equation . none equation exist ca n't solve problem scale machine learning . maybe 's multiple physic . maybe thermodynamics ﬂuid dynamic come together solve problem . maybe 's multi-physics , 's impossible u simple numerical answer . first time , machine learning give u opportunity solve problem . implication -- three large domain , 'll characterize three large domain , utterly profound 're seeing benefit . one , course , information automation , call . vast majority industry , time 've industry , 've industry since 20 year old , information technology retrieval information . look data center , vast majority data center , bunch computer connected storage , 's retrieval . 's storing file , retrieving file , sharing file , modifying file . 's retrieval . first time , take data infer model , create model , predictive model . ai ability go data figure predictive feature , predictive feature guy know , different equation -- force know mass acceleration predictive feature . 's different maxwell 's equation predictive feature . inside company , 's whole bunch data , 's way figure predictive feature . finally , machine learning come along figure predictive feature . could create model could make prediction . information automation . second field , important , science automation . people made claim 's far ai , machine learning , 's end scientific method . think scientific method sound continue exist , augmented machine learning . reason 're going observe world use ai go figure predict future . past , scientist used thought experiment . thought experiment , einstein , example , n't observe anything . completely based mathematics . 's based thought experiment . sometimes , 's observation . could say scientist make observation , intuitive observation , figure numerical-first principal method building upon previous science , method going augmented scale . , n't think 's end scientific method , scientific method going get boosted . 's called physic ml , physic machine learning . third area great impact , could almost look world break three area , 'll see really profound work done . third , first time , -- ability write software , machine write software , control really , really complicated thing , like , example , sensor infer perceive environment , reason context , reason environment mission goal come set plan . described perception , reasoning planning foundation intelligence , foundation robotics . first time , 're going see , new form software , going able automate industry , information automate industry . talk three area . first , profound impact machine learning fundamentally . second , hard ? well , first , computational method machine learning , ultimately , model -- two computer built . two basic process built artificial intelligence . one computer take whole bunch data -- take whole bunch data find predictive feature find predictive pattern relationship . relationship could space . example , one pixel another pixel , computer vision . could time , one sound versus another sound , speech recognition . could time space , video . finding relationship across -- could frequency domain , example , ffts . could physical domain . could information spatial domain . , 's lot different dimension could learn . think first part create computer suﬃciently learn data 's presented , different type data 's presented predictive model . piece software , learn data could -- number predictive feature could hundred million , whereas f equal two variable case many artificial intelligence . work example , think predict certain thing . amount modality information bring , dimensionality information bring utterly gigantic . figure take information , create architectural model could learn predict data set without overfit , meaning saw -- gave example fruit fruit orange , think orange fruit . ca n't overfit one hand . size data implies something size model , implies something computer . imagenet went million image company training hundred terabyte , moving ten petabyte data . size data , modality data , dimensionality data model wanted create predict data proportional .
