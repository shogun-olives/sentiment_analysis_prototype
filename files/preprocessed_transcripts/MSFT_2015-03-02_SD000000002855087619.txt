's many , many example ( inaudible ) microsoft also point -- company driving integration across boundary . see opportunity microsoft main principle window operating system , first-party device driving end-point innovation using service . 'll give one example . see people using surface pro 3. 's one example want best inking experience ( inaudible ) -- want ink , annotate , capture , surface pro 3 across board far best experience . 's one many , many example thinking driving innovation . 's remain strong principle using -- building mobile device , building mobile business . time , 's also important point -- also making service available mobile platform . particularly group , investing substantial engineering resource , product energy . deliver leading productivity expense o android . example , o device , mobile downloads already exceeds 80 million user downloads number keep growing . recently announced oï¬ƒce android tablet available , believe , january . internally , quite bit investing r & resource keep pace innovation deliver leading productivity service across different mobile platform , time inside microsoft driving end-to-end innovation best , complete experience microsoft 's operating system microsoft first- party device . got . maybe shifting gear little bit , drill oï¬ƒce 365 , talk u oï¬ƒce 365 tracking relative guy ' internal expectation enterprise side consumer side equation ? want drill little bit enterprise . term driving oï¬ƒce 365 growth relative expectation , see , positive trend . commercial side , focus , keith , driving adoption consumption . game cloud different . 's le selling license ; 's getting customer migrate quickly drive keith weissusages consumption . specific focus product r & side making adoption permanent part overall experience . past , sold product , used end-user experience experience . think future barrier exist . one holistic experience ; end user adopts oï¬ƒce 365 , consumption adoption experience built . lot focus driving usage adoption . consumer side , also need thing . time driving mobile end-point experience product innovation drive usage adoption . product innovation cutting u across commercial side consumer side . one sway [ ph ] . sway new operating product -- operating service -- essentially new ( inaudible ) . n't file format per se . life cloud . 's fantastic experience . mobile app . also web experience well . enables author document using simple capability -- use camera , use ink , use voice , use sort medium . beauty author , render appropriate whether 's phone tablet large screen . layout engine automatically figure 's best way showcase document . 's one key innovation tried . another innovation mentioned last year , keith , believe talked new product called adell [ ph ] . 's built new infrastructure called oï¬ƒce graph . think ; oï¬ƒce graph first version ( inaudible ) . working environment whereby graph representation people , document , message , work activity , event -- thing connected . adell product first time -- document people -- usage get connected . discover document different people using . example , ( inaudible ) lot people browse cluster . essentially , document reviewing -- trending document people sending confidentiality , thing taking care , people see kind document looking . ( inaudible ) 's huge past n't know 's going -- 's trending -- 's important . different team -- 's type innovation 's really driving adoption inside commercial product also across consumer product well . consumer oï¬ƒce 365 , pricing oï¬ƒce 365 pretty evident microsoft garner value lifetime value product . $ 100 per year versus average person buying $ 250 every five year . 's little le clear enterprise . see really good adoption term cio looking adopt oï¬ƒce 365 , recent cio survey showed 26 % cio using oï¬ƒce 365 today . another 26 % expecting use next two year . great adoption trend . talk little bit microsoft plan increase lifetime value customer term oï¬ƒce 365 subscriber versus licensed tied enterprise agreement ? qi lu yes . , keith , one key question , product innovation certainly long-term value creation standpoint . 's couple thing emphasize . one service -- moving on-premise service cloud would increase lifetime value severalfold fundamental reason . one , 's ( inaudible ) service immediately see customer interaction . pace innovation different . past , deploy new version software , adoption always long tail . typically , new version , 25 % individual adopt new version . lot customer stay older version . n't get benefit new feature . cloud service , immediately get benefit new feature . value increasing -- end-user value increasing ; 's number one . number two , interactivity enables u build digital model , mentioned earlier . using digital representation people , document , message , event , work activity , build graph . graph give u intelligence service feature generate would productivity user . drive pace innovation deliver value customer . think fundamental -- one fundamental trend delivering value driving fast-paced innovation end user . productivity get lifted ; 's number one . number two adjacent area . mental model -- past three decade [ ph ] , today 's productivity large using pc endpoint device , using file folder document main form delivering productivity . moving cloud , end point -- computing edge moving mobile device delivery cover different people . therefore envelope productivity expand . today , productivity service , 1.1 billion user . believe reach 2 billion professional three year new generation productivity experience available mobile device . reach larger customer base . enable u expand ; 's another area value growth . area value growth natural adjacency . course , couple thing . one 've focusing adding service compliance security . thing move cloud , 's lot lot value . protecting data , critical enterprise important , particularly ( inaudible ) nsa area . 's lot concern moving data cloud moving service cloud . protect ? beefing product offering enables u , , add -- create value growth initiative . said , inside microsoft also cross-sell ( inaudible ) opportunity . example , last quarter reached ( inaudible ) mobile -- enterprise mobility service , em product . 's one many example use oï¬ƒce 365 integrate microsoft service create value . combination -- ( inaudible ) think driving value productivity end user keith wei qi lu -- look natural adjacency , look boundary synergy opportunity inside microsoft , overall collectively grow enterprise value focusing innovation using oï¬ƒce 365. got . maybe stepping one adjacency , newly renamed cipher [ ph ] business . 's one -- fastest area -- fast product-growing area guy . talk u 's resonating customer within cipher business offering ? using today ? expand next couple year ? cipher consumer play ? 's great question . way think -- think cipher business represents huge growth opportunity . today , keith , already multi-billion- dollar business . leading scenario enterprise customer , see ton ton opportunity remove pressure create value . large , today's meeting expense full friction , based survey . average , meeting take 14 minute get started 's sort issue -- people calling , connection n't good . sometimes people forgot mute keep talking . remind please unmute . , turn 's lot opportunity really use technology innovation remove friction . 's one aspect . second aspect building tiered technological foundation -- shared infrastructure time future communication , particularly audio-video conference communication , become smart sense today , let 's say phone call video call . talk planning trip la vega . software n't know going la vega ; give recommendation order . future , envision future communication become smart building full stack . communication going -- understood 's talked . providing additional service -- additional tool made conversation lot intelligent easier use . see fantastic opportunity lift quality experience full productivity meeting scenario . furtherly , aï¬ƒnity skype business skype . building unified stack . future , skype skype business become uniform , essentially coherent set experience consumer enterprise customer . today , already supporting interop . skype user skype business user , interop . future , experience . important . see future trend -- individual , going separate thing -- thing use work , thing use life . going use service really work . 's opportunity u use -- leverage skype brand . global user base -- skype huge global user base . also , large mobile presence . skype product called groupme ; that's keith wei qi luone popular product united state college student . merging two uniform product offering single technology stack consistently experience , believe 's fantastic new opportunity drive lot growth case platform business . take two answer together , term getting higher lifetime value customer without moving adjacency , sound like going bundling larger deal customer bundling service trying sell customer productivity application standpoint . time , bundle going toward subscription day offering . wrong think time whole group going become 100 % subscription revenue term offering customer ? great question . economically , model-wise , keith , thinking baseline economics going per-user subscription . transformation take time . exactly many year , let thing play . see business model compelling variety different reason . one free innovation opportunity . future , innovate also client experience ; n't matter client want use . long connecting microsoft cloud service , connecting computing intelligence , get economics fundamentally 's per-user subscription . migration path lot . envision team innovation . certain people , want stay win 32 -- local apps using traditional experience . younger generation , going move fantastic new experience . everybody able collaborate seamlessly economic model enables u . past , charging client , really migrate cloud . per-user subscription enables , smooth transition customer migrate cloud -- 's , appealing . time , also think 's opportunity u add value driving different category innovation . example , case microsoft productivity cloud , one thing interesting -- people n't think search fundamental productivity tool . would hard personally imagine productive professional without access certain service . today , 's kind bifurcated . go google bing consumer search experience , go enterprise search look internal internet information external information . ? think 's fantastic opportunity u build future generation search experience . professional , marketing person working pharmaceutical company , go ( inaudible ) bing -- whatever type , information right . search economics part . even though 's necessary per user subscription , monetizing based intent . know , search economics , 's , keith wei qi luvery potent value extraction engine . believe 's fantastic opportunity focus baseline , per-user subscription . add value proposition make ( inaudible ) strong . rich client move cloud move mobile ( inaudible ) . time , 's opportunity u augment model collectively capture amount economics . got . good segue search business . want make sure get side focus . thinking ongoing investment online business going-forward business ? like talking , satya talked path profitability -- promising profitability fy16 . weighing sort need promise profitability opportunity see kind extend bing today search today ? great question . thinking following . believe -- way model everything everything build work/life experience . essentially every experience always work life experience . fundamental thesis assumption , believe future friction low , people going pick service work across work life . going choose , work 'm going , life 'm going . therefore , every product group work/life product . mail -- used separate mail stack hotmail.com exchange outlook ; 's single stack .

's one stack . onedrive -- used onedrive consumer , onedrive business sharepoint ; 's one stack . skype -- used skype business , 's single stack . bing -- bing future , bing business , 's single stack . essentially , consumer ( inaudible ) n't think 's natural extension workload , experience , stack technology . work/life experience . 's number one . number two , fundamental focus , priority , focus work 's -- believe microsoft brand , market footprint give u permission -- give u ability differentiate increase separation user data , usage . innovation opportunity create group separation microsoft 's offering competitor . going win work scenario first . belief winning work scenario professional , student , future going bright use -- user use service life occasion well . that's think reasoning everything , invest . 's work/life -- workload always going work/life experience , priority work scenario . belief time , user use service work -- life scenario . keith wei qi lu keith wei qi lu got . term necessity seeing success mobile , talk synergy search business presence mobile ? important window 10 adoption going kind taking online business mobile environment ? , important , least mentioned earlier . industry , particularly mobile , really see 's phase whereby vertical integration across device -- operating system service drive lot innovation . cortana one example . cortana -- many way , think 's extension bing . 's built bing engine , natural interaction . deeply integrate window phone commanding , discovery , get recommendation . 's lot opportunity . way , bing also support siri . apple siri , apple ( inaudible ) life -- back end , back ( inaudible ) supported bing well . 's one important example driving end-to-end innovation . using search technology -- search service go much , much deeper . phone , experience still early stage . 's lot opportunity build next-generation experience capture economics . 's number one . number two , keith , question window 10 option , 's , important . window 10 , think , really gigantic milestone revitalize window franchise , particularly modern device , mobile phone ( inaudible ) particular . internal alignment super , super strong across different division . -- based early evidence seeing , going drive lot call smart search -- next-generation bing search , part -- integrates , seamlessly window 10 device , particularly mobile phone ( inaudible ) , whether 's tablet phone . 's lot opportunity u drive adoption usage certain economic growth microsoft . got . wanted touch yahoo relationship well . press , perhaps seeing mercer meyer [ ph ] expressing frustration search partnership past , progress shared gain versus google . believe yahoo partnership going remain durable guy next several year ? challenge remain making sure yahoo relationship beneficial side equation ? everyone sort happy participant partnership going forward ? keith wei q - unidentified participant - keith wei - qi luthe original got new deal -- basic premise strong alignment win-win scenario two company , particularly product innovation synergy economic synergy . 've committed microsoft side work yahoo team drive overall growth better innovation across two endpoint -- platform -- bing platform . think bing.com instance yahoo.com search , instance . 's sort ( inaudible ) going . closer five-year anniversary . opportunity take another look see look like next phase . remain positive 's plenty opportunity two company . look fundamentally important u find way continue collaboration two company . got . want take opportunity open question ï¬‚oor anyone audience question qi . front . ( inaudible ) see repeat . question answer ( inaudible â€ “ audience question ) 'll break two question . first part question coopetition degree microsoft working closely partner , say , like file share . one drive competitive dropbox . guy signed partnership agreement . guy think plus minus , perhaps potential revenue loss better enabling partner like box dropbox versus opportunity working guy ? 'll go second part question . yes . great question . thank question . think . largest providers-players productivity space . migrating cloud going mobile world . along journey , coopetition instance place . work case case . mentioned dropbox . certainly working dropbox team . really love partnership ; going continue partnership . meet drew team , super clear . going collaborate , collaborate experience whereby make combined customer better . meaning user choose dropbox onedrive also use microsoft oï¬ƒce productivity software , customer , - keith wei - qi lu - keith weisshave better experience . also clear , going compete . going compete -- onedrive , going offer compelling service drive adoption customer . super clear . principle team , getting user usage ? 's number one . number two , overall , combined customer -- getting better experience ? two , look trade- . sometimes trade-off complete positive . sometimes trade-off nuanced -- negotiate ( inaudible ) . coopetition deal case case . principle going lot many , many player ; 's simple reality . net , allow microsoft oï¬ƒce grow user base , grow usage , ultimately time net win core business . 's think . second part question acquisition strategy . past year 've seen couple small acquisition like revolution analytic , tom mentioned sunrise , think calendaring app . microsoft thinking buy versus build decision today ? likely going buying functionality ? 's potential larger acquisition functionality maybe heading adjacency ? common principle use always first declare want . declare want always analyze three option -- buy versus build versus ( inaudible ) case going like -- case example mentioned -- acquisition -- want great product , 's number one . number two , great talent . talent many way also weighs quite heavily transform microsoft one key thing drive internally driving cultural change , driving different product ( inaudible ) focusing user/usage . focused customer orientation , focusing designing mobile point screen experience . sometimes transformation accelerated bringing talent outside microsoft microsoft . 's combination building -- acquiring great product , great talent . case company really -- excited opportunity everything see -- come silicon valley , said , almost every week . clearly , 's best mobile mail client . rebrand outlook brand , momentum unbelievable . 's opposite ( inaudible ) team , every 10,000 downloads , ring bell bell keep ringing . 's opportunity truly u software acquisition accelerate growth core business . additional question audience ? q - unidentified participant - qi lu - keith wei q - unidentified participantthank presentation . time microsoft bought nokia 's mobile business -- mobile ( inaudible ) business , n't going talk microsoft interested mapping asset nokia . ask given saying regarding platform rest , would industrial logic microsoft owning mapping asset house , please ? great question . think . mapping asset product quite strategic u . think 's navigation service guide b. 's really geospatial namespace enable many , many product innovation business synergy space . 's . number two , look historically economics 's needed support mapping asset , several possibility . one search economics . google , 's somewhat no-brainer . 20 % 25 % ( inaudible ) local intent . part search , show map screen case add fixed cost . google particular , kind even make sense leading business whereby fixed cost higher margin , cost low , add fixed cost . microsoft , 's little bit challenge bing volume n't nearly big google 's search volume . founding map asset economically little bit challenging pure search perspective microsoft . found mobile device . turn mapping becomes must-have service phone . way apple economics work pay $ 1.50 -- whatever ( inaudible ) material . enough phone volume , fund well . microsoft , combination search volume phone volume fund . ongoing basis key drive innovation particularly u focus using geospatial namespace productivity . easily imagine sort interesting possibility . professional going speak particular important customer . either get place -- know campus map , may get right building quickly way . really future scenario , microsoft best experience professional enterprise application . see 's lot opportunity u drive value , drive innovation . take one last one . comment azure oï¬ƒce 365 prospect china ? - qi lu - keith wei - qi lu - keith wei - qi lu , good question . china special , different special rule chinese government established multi-national company play cloud . microsoft actually first multi-national company china public cloud offering , call ( inaudible ) . essentially worked partner ( inaudible ) -- essentially china , direct operator ; operated chinese company . build technology -- train partner operate cloud . oï¬ƒce , applies . huge , huge growth opportunity microsoft see tremendous early adoption growth pattern chinese customer . visiting china talked chinese customer time .
