's great . 's good curate first set customer , get successful open . well , think want make sure 're able work trusted . find use case customer done responsibly safely focus return , think 's part excitement beginning new technology see . exciting . yes . . 's exciting . gilly [ ph ] said dying ask -- know waiting . waiting make sure gave time . otherwise , kash , going give feedback . know , know . gilly , sorry . thank , first , amy , taking time today . wanted double click azure little bit 're seeing come cloud optimization . talked lot investment cycle done past decade transition 've seen . evaluating come customer cohort geos ? evaluate like cycle long may last ? say , question think get asked . - amy hood q - analyst - amy hoodhopefully one little different . , 's . 's think 's become think new -- almost new language mean , frankly , n't great job explaining optimization sort part running workload always part running workload . think thing really , really , really growing never talked mean seemed like normal part running business . first would say , 's anything particular would go cohorting geos industry cycle . would back say , customer optimize job platform provider help . incent people help . 's running workload eï¬ƒciently get highest return every dollar spent . 's important concept . want money reinvested new workload . course , interest 're seeing ai great example , right ? able make room budget , get started newer maybe different workload 's list , right , 've tried work budget . look say , gosh , -- microsoft particular , think comp 're starting lap bigger optimization quarter , almost people call , make laugh little bit . 're starting lap bigger one . people think mean 's thing came lasted little bit people stopped . customer . get value . continue focus reinvesting , hopefully , saving room budget back new workload . think 's process 're focused making sure 're . 's also process comp get little easier , know everybody always focused exactly one number . think probably -- say differently , everybody welcome think way want , right ? 's life . way tend think described , right , , 's normal part job make sure customer get value help reinvest great thing . reinvestment obviously generative ai , thinking magnitude implication might come inferencing training ? obviously , azure going see impact azure , also oï¬ƒce 365 copilot touched . q - analyst - amy hood q - analyst - amy hoodyes , 's -- 's interesting . general , one important concept u time opposed maybe decade ago -- decade ago lot different business running infrastructure , right , taking , sound antiquated , took exchange made change online . sharepoint . made online . platform , right ? time around , say thing , noticed 's opportunity ineï¬ƒciency , right ? 's fungibility asset . time , sitting lot , right , fungible platform . whether platform need used support third party supporting first party , platform . demand ability say , oh gosh , 've got copilot demand 've got platform , third-party demand azure openai service , lends lot ï¬‚exibility whether 's inferencing workload , maybe could training workload , unique aspect . general , bigger point think u 're running business make sure fungible 're able meet customer demand exists way make sense u . tend think , people call -- call thing azure , right ? azure fully sits every ai-enabled workload offer probably best way thinking , far different decade ago , think allows lot confidence term return invested capital shorter period time . translate capex think incremental step-up -- 're line . yes , like think -- like think incremental step-up , think something community really thinking much genai related much data center guy much broader footprint first started azure . 's exactly right . think , -- people like , oh gosh , genai . reality , 's . giant cloud business , lot capital going support cloud business . guess call non-ai . 's funny term , maintain replacement capital , growth capital core . investment 's coming support , 'll use term ai-enabled workload , copilot , azure openai service 's another piece . would n't say , would -- would n't right think ai- related , 's driving piece . q - kash rangan - amy hood q - kash rangan - amy hood q - kash rangan think investor ' feedback -- 's gpus . ai gpus . 're going ai , buy gpus , inherently expensive . depreciate much quicker , everybody math assimilating core azure certain capex profile , certain profile tech stack go , well-commoditized , well-worn , 've got massive eï¬ƒciencies economy scale , whereas new cycle 're getting , 's concern . well , guess -- yes , think 's way , skill eï¬ƒciencies 've gone azure side running at-scale business . 'll see thing happen ai platform side , 'll see software improvement , 'll see power improvement , 'll see investment optimizing large model , 'll see -- end lot eï¬ƒciency growth think would say good way also thinking . always ineï¬ƒciencies 're seeing surge like , take time plug thing , -- time 's utilized pretty short . whereas think -- say , gosh , well , five year ago 10 year ago process ? 's . mean time monetize time revenue pretty tight . learning really heart question eï¬ƒciencies picked prior cycle , translatable . although people look jump capex say , well , 's really ineï¬ƒcient , 's . overcome learning . , think think thing 're talking contributing point two revenue ai , started talking first time march . like take like minor step back excitement , 're seeing -- would argue , quite good revenue growth product month market . also think 's important realize ai workload n't -- n't require ai service , right ? require data service . require platform service . whether 's excitement around fabric , whether 's excitement around data work think 've announced recently . 'll see ai workload contribute core azure , even 's ai revenue . 's important concept . 's partially additionally drive capital need , right , got -- investment data state prerequisite . - amy hood q - kash rangan - amy hood q - kash rangan - amy hood q - kash rangan - amy hoodamy , going copilot pilot ? 's question . n't going answer anyway . everybody 's talking copilot , guy whole bunch software company . everybody got copilot . even on-premises company copilot , n't make sense 're on-premise would ï¬‚ying ? anyway , 's question . going say , . real question , 've got beta program going oï¬ƒce microsoft 365 copilot . think , one , financial service firm may aï¬ƒliated may aï¬ƒliated past also testing . customer feedback copilot justifying price 're asking ? feedback good . made point good customer set , think , industry representation , functional representation , get good feedback used . might imagine , people like , use powerpoint able fix . listen , know sound like , oh gosh , n't sound like save time . listen , say something , hey , please fix font 40- page deck . used take mean long time . like helvetica . like courier . right . mean , kind thing cause real problem world . noticing issue . second . thousand time lot people working day-to-day deliverable . whether 're marketing content generation , whether prompt , 're maybe creative ideation lot feedback . think team general gotten lot feedback term ability meeting recap , meeting summary , ca n't , feel like , ability really think better use time maybe , n't know , maybe everybody go meeting 're like , oh gosh , 'm glad came . occasion willing read summary feel pretty good , q - kash rangan - amy hood q - kash rangan - amy hood q - kash rangan - amy hoodthink -- think term everybody 's knowledge up- to-date , feel like information pass u .
