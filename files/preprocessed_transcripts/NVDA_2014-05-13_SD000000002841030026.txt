good morning , everyone . name betsy van hees semiconductor analyst wedbush security . excited senior director , investor relation chris evenden way santa clara , california , nvidia . going little different prior . 're going little fireside chat , chris i. wanted start thing , chris , giving overview nvidia telling everyone little bit company . overview nvidia . nvidia founded 20 year ago started gpu company . meant improving gaming experience pc gamers . evolve technology , improved technology leveraged ip new market . first adjacent market went professional graphic . levered technology go professional graphic . 's product called quadro . advanced gpu technology made programmable leveraged go compute . using gpu math , graphic . 's business called tesla . actually leveraging technology provide gpu power remotely , 's business call grid . finally using gpu technology betsy van hees chris evendenintegrated soc mobile computing application . tegra market mobile automotive well . , $ 4 point something billion company . 60 % revenue geforce business , 20 % quadro , 10 % 15 % tesla rest tegra . perfect . thank . chris next question wanted ask , well 's casual fireside chat , next question wanted ask guy great quarter , great guidance , congratulation . wondering could talk little drove guy ? sure . standout quarter previous quarter actually core gpu business , specifically gaming . model analyze geforce business internally look two fairly distinct market sell . one gaming . consumer buying pc largely gaming mind . might make excuse significant pc gaming definitely significant part . business 're buying boutique pc , buying aftermarket gpus upgrade pc . icafe china , significant business , example . element geforce business mainstream pc , largely notebook . oem buying gpu differentiate notebook define notebook premium notebook , like . 's much weaker business seeing long-term weakness mainstream notebook market think everyone seeing . business think -- market mainstream notebook , think , long-term decline . however , pc gaming good health 's seeing think 57 % year year . significantly year year still well . lot new game came fall . think perversely fact console first time history essentially pc , architecturally new console pc , mean much easier game developer port aaa console content pc well . think see continued strong stream content pc platform . - betsy van hees - chris evendenand china interesting development . china long biggest gaming market -- ea 's piece tended lower seeing decline climb . game like blade & soul , high production value game , high production value mean high resolution content mean get better gpu , mean revenue u . factor driving strong gaming revenue last couple quarter . year year tegra significantly well , quadro . 's generally broad-based gaming would say standout strength . tesla strong . tesla continuing grow nicely . 's important point . question answer anyone question raise hand . 's open q & . one biggest thing hear investor . sure hear thing , gaming market . gaming market dead go ahead get free game android . going go spend money paying game ? yet guy continue tremendous growth continue see important driver . well gaming market -- pc gaming -- people telling pc gaming decline ever since entered industry decade ago . believed would depressing . could n't truth . pc gaming extremely healthy . 's bunch reason . think biggest reason sort alluded question , business model pc gaming quite different traditional console model charging $ 60 shrink-wrapped software , sort fire-and-forget model . pc gaming open platform , 's innovative . seen lot innovation china , partly china impossible charge software . find way monetizing content . see innovation term subscription term free-to-play , in- game transaction , micro-transactions , downloadable content , innovation generate revenue software developer without actually requiring $ 60 upfront fee . - betsy van hees - chris evendenin fact , analysis , think dfc analysis suggests something like 80 % pc gaming software revenue -- let say 'll say way around -- 20 % pc game software revenue shrink-wrapped software rest downloaded game , downloadable content , thing . 's lot innovation around monetizing content . course regardless monetize content need decent pc play content . 's geforce give . innovation rewarding game developer also rewarding u well . going say american , 'm actually american , n't know tell . someone little american . 've lived decade . sometimes forgiven believing pc gaming n't good health . go best buy 's really hard find pc sort graphic . console almost ubiquitous . travel bit far east think develop different impression . actually , another example misleading evidence eye ﬂew yesterday san francisco walked plane , always back plane reason , n't know 'm wrong , everyone using iphone . everyone using iphone . yet worldwide iphone share smartphone market 30 % . live box extent . also pc gaming huge america bought best buy . people buying graphic card newegg , building pc using newegg , buying razer pc company gamer probably may heard . downloading game . going gamestop buy shrink-wrapped cd dvd , actually downloading game . like said go asia , go icafes see -- , think starbucks brand proposition starbucks place work home . 's function icafes china -- meeting place , social place , place people go hang . lucrative business moving market well premium offering 's good u . pc gaming market decline n't decline last decade since industry ? - betsy van hees - chris evendenthe strongest piece evidence give demonstrate pc market decline look revenue . 's written . ( multiple speaker ) account . good point . excellent point . want , leave consumer side gpu business , notebook , obviously notebook side talked challenge . 've got integrated graphic 's always -- attach rate slowing -- always big bear case nvidia aside pc gaming . kind wanted touch market guy . also , question leave pc gaming asp , talk little bit asp ? said 're newegg positive corporate gross margin . sure . yes people talk attach rate , percentage basically number gpus shipped expressed percentage number cpu shipped . people talk integrated graphic , free graphic come every pc , might threat u . think missing dynamic . think attach rate certainly going increase year . may well decrease driver people starting play graphic game integrated graphic . driver pressure mainstream notebook market general specifically cost pressure manufacturer device . mentioned beginning gpu defines notebook premium also solid-state drive touchscreen . think touchscreen penetration seems leveled touch screen . ssds think continue increase put pressure gpu attach rate . market certainly growth market year , would say certainly modeling decline u . , said gaming notebook growing quite nicely core gaming desktop market growing nicely well . overall geforce business healthy . think unit year year asp revenue . point , profit margin well 's much richer mix u well . asp significantly lower oem business 's cost-driven sale whereas gaming sale , like , value-driven sale . since - betsy van hees - chris evenden - betsy van hees - chris evendenwe providing something someone specifically want asp stronger charge appropriately value provide . one thing -- many thing nvidia 's great . guy fantastic technology foresight jen-hsun term innovation change made . guy saw declining pc market course gaming market continues robust , guy ventured area . jen-hsun said call tesla grid becoming interchangeable talk two . 're able talk grid 've got like 50 deployment , think right going ? grid . grid actually hundred trial worldwide . -- well stand corrected . grid mentioned , serving broadly speaking , serving graphic cloud . serving graphic -- power gpu remotely number way monetize technology . one making citrix vmware better . virtual desktop-linked infrastructure , improving . one providing gaming remotely . one ﬂexible provide graphic power heavy graphic user small organization like architecture firm high-quality rendering time time . moving forward . one focused immediate term virtual desktop infrastructure opportunity . 's one nearly 600 trial running worldwide . 's number increased last two quarter least , increased 40 % cost , extraordinary . 's early day yet , still double digit term revenue 's parlor project . question start converting production conversion rate size typical deal . impossible characterize right still early day . fully supported citrix december last year . 've announced fully supporting vmware esx next version vmware n't said - betsy van hees - chris evendenexactly coming 's month away . 's delay get full production implementation . end year would think data use characterize properly think 's going material business u q3 , q4 year . think significant revenue . course margin profile business extremely good well . luck building recurring revenue component well software software maintenance . q3 q4 material , 's great beyond 's really next leg story calendar year 2015 2016 look growth projection 'm sure guy modeling business ? yes , jen-hsun would say enthusiastic grid anything -- 's lacking enthusiasm business . grid certainly one see immediate significant contribution . looking interest synergy last year , citrix user show -- n't go year last week , ( inaudible ) little bit preoccupied . enthusiasm extraordinary removed one big obstacle adoption virtual desktop infrastructure , user resistance department love virtual environment . love security , love manageability , love idea leave laptop plane lost laptop , data issue . love fact back . data get hand . user issue implementation bit clunky . n't support video well . n't support even basic 3d application . think autocad , example , market u running today mostly intel integrated , supported . although fairly 3d much 3d virtual desktop infrastructure . support . removed obstacle . ecosystem , like , around citrix vmware excited . 's whole new market u enterprise desktop never place played enables u get million seat front million user . q - unidentified participant - chris evenden - betsy van hees - chris evendenso 's wonderful opportunity something leveraging existing ip provide something demonstrable value . corporate desktop . yes , interesting business . ( inaudible ) whether 's using virtual desktop regular pc ? repeat question benefit -- question , saying user ca n't tell using virtual desktop local pc . n't know ever invisible certainly bringing two experience much much closer together . allowing use application using local pc virtual desktop certainly case gpus server . 's improving user experience actually broadening applicability virtual desktop environment well wider variety user . leave gpu space wanted talk competitive landscape . amd/ati , former employer , making big push market late . wondering could talk competitive landscape amd sort refocusing reenergizing business ? love idea n't refocused energized . long -- even joined nvidia , focused winning workspace share u , example . making aggressive noise right n't think behavior changed significantly . staying workstation moment , charge trying win business -- eight , according idc 82 % unit share estimate 90 % dollar share workstation . amd recently redefined consumer win workstation win . one fell swoop increased size workstation market . technically gain workstation share wo n't gain u , growing market , redefining existing skew . problem face gaining workstation share u broadly better solution , better software compatibility , better testing , better performance , better relationship -- hp dell , sell majority card . also customer well . strategy cutting price win business n't work workstation people using high-end workstation , one - betsy van hees - chris evendenwith sharp end generating wealth company . n't skimp provide . sitting $ 10,000 workstation , salary probably $ 200,000 , let 's say , software another $ 20,000 $ 100,000 depending actually running . $ 2,000 graphic card , $ 1,500 graphic card , $ 500 saving immaterial consider loss productivity lack stability using untested solution . strong defensible position market . low end transactional business guided price . may movement back forth term revenue share n't see changing significantly . story broadly similar geforce well actually . 's notebook unit talking , actually large proportion number unit sold quarter actually small proportion revenue even smaller proportion gross profit . actually dropping significantly price could win nice large piece notebook business without moving revenue needle . data good always like surround market share data big caveat unit data , 's revenue data . see movement share , movement share , would caution understand unit share probably need drilling decide 's actually revenue . high end , , confident technology . 've started introducing maxwell . 750 750 ti launched last quarter extremely successful worldwide think bodes well rest maxwell range introduce year . want talk tegra . spent good amount time 've got much time tegra . important , , innovation seeing future making change seeing happening . tegra success 's good time bad time look like back track . congratulation quarter-on-quarter revenue growth . wondering could break market little bit depth term guy refocusing energy versus year ago especially gtc analyst day jen-hsun talked smartphone market chasing mainstream . 's right . tegra leveraging core ip , gpu integrating cpu component need build soc , multimedia computer chip . vision five six year ago build -- smartphones one market going . number market within android smartphones certainly largest term unit . tegra 4i thought really really good chip obviously n't success hoped despite strength product . challenge -- investor never tire reminding -- getting market . made decision ca n't solve problem tegra 5i tegra 4i good chip . even hindsight think think 's good product . product issue , market structure , domination certain provider , whatever ca n't fix tegra 5i . let 's stop banging head particular brick wall move . said still seeing success high-end smartphone market discrete chip . separate soc separate baseband . phone shipping unit right xiaomi mi3 . continue offer product high-end smartphone market . continue offer product tablet well looking various way monetize market well . provider like shield looking build -- shield handheld gaming device , android-based -- looking build gaming ecosystem android . believe android significant gaming segment within 'm talking someone necessarily buy everything . people buy shield obviously buying game . people buy tablet -- gamers buy tablet . someone like play game want buy tablet anyway reason want buy tablet , may well one actually support hobby playing game well . think significant niche opportunity -- call niche large opportunity u . market go shield software work 're build ecosystem . course automotive one right easiest point unqualified success . growing rapidly year year . 's stable business . - betsy van hees - chris evendenwe right across model volkswagen audi group , top bottom bmw . one major manufacturer n't announced obviously working hard others well . something like revenue pipeline -- pipeline probably right word -- commitment $ 2 billion worth revenue . sat hand next five six year revenue would come . clearly sitting hand , clearly going trying win . market dynamic working u electronics becoming important part car experience . sit new bmw new audi increasingly fully digital dash . quality dash say lot driver car . also programmability gpu , sort touched , n't talked tesla much today . gpu good taking data turning image , actually good taking image turning back data . take input camera around car discern lot environment car driving . audi example think vsas call specific term , 's basically advanced driver assistance system . parking car , warning getting close car front . system even recognizes speed sign , speed limit sign side road alert tell going fast . recognizes whether drifting outside white line alert . got blinker moving white line probably drifting . 's sort thing important technology step route fully automated car . 's something map well tegra . market continuing play strength see strong opportunity growth . whereas role driving nav system 's driving nav system actual instrument cluster increasingly also getting involved driver automation system well . opportunity car actually growing even number car opportunity growing well . $ 2 billion , high-end , moving midrange car well ? - betsy van hees - chris evendenso european audience would know , scotia manufacture , part volkswagen audi group . scotia definitely mainstream manufacturer . audi a3 , bmw mini . 's limited share premium car . think market love talk tesla automotive car , love talk lamborghini , love talk bentley . reality stretching right mainstream . modeling suggests -- forget market research firm . say 's 100 million car 2017 made . think opportunity 2017 40 million unit . 's 40 million car one unit per car , average . 's still significant opportunity u point actually gauged somewhat geography well manufacture , going mainstream car . n't found way get tougher motif $ 1,000 car yet definitely moving mainstream . sound like guy really early mover advantage . guy got . , nipping heel going able maintain dominance currently today continue $ 2 billion grow even larger ? automotive 's good question . traditional competitor space freescale ti . think , significant strength -- time ? significant strength computing user experience n't think early success . qualcomm certainly made lot noise wanting get car , intel made lot noise getting car . 's complex software stack long product cycle . think pretty strong position . said think unique depth knowledge , particularly come advanced driver automation , significant differentiator u , software stack . n't talked far today actually software engineer hardware engineer . although classified semiconductor company . basis engineer would ask reclassifies u software company make chip well . - betsy van hees - chris evendenand 's huge -- think difference product offering , difference geforce , quadro tesla software , 's chip . extent true offering within tegra well . software stack incredibly important think 's huge part value provide . 's little red ﬂashing -- know . wish time . thank . much , chris . really appreciate coming new york . thank much . thanks inviting .
