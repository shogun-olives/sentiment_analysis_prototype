'll pause minute see question audience . go ahead raise hand , otherwise , 'll finish q & . right , we're getting people revved . 's still little early . 're still getting caffeinated . 'm going ask one favorite question . 's edge . anybody 's read stuff know 'm big edge guy . 've written obviously lot . talk microsoft 365 fit whole intelligent edge , intelligent cloud strategy . yes . 's core . think oﬃce 365 proplus window 10 window defender atp , give security client , edge , getting signal edge , making sure 've got latest capability productivity perspective . also ensure signal help customer security posture , even help customer -- measuring productivity effectiveness way use tool . -- secure score . give every customer secure score , tell improve security posture . get understanding 's happening edge 's happening core . could include ( ad ) signal , window signal , oﬃce signal , signal azure . take altogether , give security score .

'll come thing value-oriented pricing versus tied per user . cool . last question , , kind forward -- guess , road map sort microsoft 365 lot area imagine -- sort kind continue pivot suite , whether identity access management , message security , virtual desktop , et cetera . seems like multiple area . think sort building organically , acquiring versus partnering ? like draw line ? yes . 's really balance . think 3. n't -- would say 1 3 priority . 're important . 've got number partner integrate microsoft . look team look add new apps team , lot partner continuing grow . look even security , lot partner work within security space integrate microsoft 365. time , em e5 , made important acquisition build product term security capability . -- microsoft team , built organically . felt super good decision feel really good fit strong integration across oﬃce 365 day 1. 's really balance across 3. 're 3 important . right . 30 minute actually finished . went fast . thank , everyone , coming . thank , ron kicking track 1. thanks coming . appreciate . thanks , phil . appreciate , man . thank .
