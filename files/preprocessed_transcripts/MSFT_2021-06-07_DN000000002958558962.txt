's going become far digital 's going really evolve user subscription model consumption-based model , pay-as-you-go , use first pay later , freemium becomes really , really important . service , get started free eventually ask pay subscription pay-as-you-go . 's required huge amount engineering , course , 's le supply-led 's much demand-led . customer expect come microsoft.com able stand azure virtual machine using whatever operating system want swiping credit card getting started , even actually paying first 30 60 day , want able take existing window server license able move server cloud without re-buy license really sophisticated business model thing 've developed past bunch year . spot pricing become reality u . n't somebody using capacity particular time day , algorithmically change price vm cost 're willing evacuated vm somebody paying higher price access 24/7 . consumption model , sophisticated user subscription model , think , little straightforward people understand . , kirk , one cool thing , know -- got hunt want nerd today , area absolutely love . one cool thing , we're starting see blend two thing . , example , buy microsoft 365 user-based subscription , get certain amount power platform technology , power apps , power bi , et cetera , game . governed limited , need compute , let 's say , need powerful server powerful core power power bi , would buy consumption top already user-based subscription , sort surge capability part 365 subscription . , actually think future 're going see far blending . simple , well , 's user-based model , oh 's consumption-based model . think get lot user-based , want like compute 'll search period time , pay u consumption , done surge , maybe 're closing book quarter need power bi juice , speak , mean customer really , think , much blend work . business model company , -- think , 's totally fascinating moved user-based consumption-based , think expect blend time opposed simple binary choice . yeah .
