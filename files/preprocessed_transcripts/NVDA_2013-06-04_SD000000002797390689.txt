good afternoon , everyone . welcome session , last certainly least . 'm vivek arya , semiconductor analyst bank america merrill lynch . i'm absolutely delighted rob csongor nvidia , head nvidia's investor relation team . like session , let 's keep interactive also . 'll go series question . 's 40-minute session . 'll go question 20 25 minute . 'll open ﬂoor q & . , rob , welcome . thank . thanks , vivek . maybe let 's start high level . could give u state union see term spending environment . participate number different consumer enterprise market . feel optimistic , le optimistic , right ? talk near term . 'll go longer-term trend . okay . think overall , 're mostly optimistic one fundamental dynamic , visual computing becoming critical variety different market . currently , existing customer , existing market , like pc gaming . think one first question people ask nvidia , `` possible gpu business growing fourth consecutive year row , pc vivek arya rob csongormarket declining ? '' answer n't address entire pc market ; address segment pc market . one segment pc gaming . second professional workstation . within market , demand visual computing voracious . look business , see asp trend going . driving asp trend . gross margin going . look overall market , gaming market growing $ 16 billion year $ 20 billion 2015. first , market serve fundamentally growing . within workstation market , even last year , even though last year declining segment , largely stable business . think 's actually , even though sound weird , 's actually good news u . quadro business stable midst one worst year ever , think say market robust . beyond , gpus going new market , include segment like compute , ramping business . grid , new business , putting gpus data center streaming graphic . think 's one part business . part business tegra , would describe new device , new type computing device . 's number thing going . fundamentally , see lot dynamic driving . gaming continues 76 % revenue google make . two-thirds people tablet play game . believe nvidia 's uniquely positioned unique core competency drive market . let 's maybe go market , starting gpu . nvidia pioneer market . one thing , look market last five year , market ﬂattish . seen share shift amd . last three year , done exceptionally well market . share gone almost 68 % . two question -- fair think overall buy gpus sort fixed . outsized performance come share gain ? 's case , much room gain share market ? would say 's right way look business . gpu business grew four consecutive year row . n't mean share grew four consecutive year row . 're correlated . vivek arya rob csongor vivek aryawhat mean overall market demand gpus grew , either either sold product higher price people . think share story yes , grew share amd . question come 's going happen share . think bottom line amd competitor . 're still competitor . whatever issue , gone away . expect compete . 're going compete hard ever . 's consumes u . consumes u . think , , number one , feed best product gamers ? number two , meet need new compute opportunity ? take grid enable visual computing experience pc . kind display ? thing allow u drive business lot design win , competing competitor . trend among , whether 's channel whether 's oem , would prefer give whatever , 70 % market share ? think since lot business go channel , 's mainly gamers end day determine whether would buy nvidia geforce whether would buy amd radeon gpu ? regardless exists , particular customer term -- 're implying vendor management -- best strategy know create demand product . develop product 's value gamer , develop product 's value scientist , 's ultimately believe drive business . , happens within pc gaming space , gaming done , pc gamers building channel . know , channel system builder , upgrade thing like . think even , regardless whether 's channel whether 's oems , nvidia direct relationship gamers . 's something think unique technology company . think 's ultimately 're going focus attention . talking earlier . think making interesting point trend notice whenever 's new game console cycle , sometimes , contrary people would assume game console come market , capture attention ; perhaps pc gaming go . 's case , could elaborate , two new big console supposed come next quarter . rob csongor vivek arya rob csongor yes . well first , overall perspective , guess 's , every time 's cycle game console , 's always little different . twenty year ago , first joined nvidia , game console 100 time powerful pc . idea spending $ 60 game selling 50 title one person conceivable , way get 3d graphic experience time game console . , world today , n't exist . today pc 100 time powerful game console . , game console rev , 's performance level high-end pc . stimulate lot -- there's content 's developed would describe mid-range pc . content becomes available pc market . result , see stimulation part business , mid-range pc level . typically , past 've seen game console business , think 've seen gpu business -- 's point people say , `` oh , 's . 'm playing pc game anymore . 'm going go game console . '' n't think 's case today . think increasingly , 's , course , lot issue model , game market ? today , game market , example , android 600 million user , price start free go $ 0.99 , $ 1.99 , $ 7.99 . reason work developer 600 million user . know , 76 % google revenue game . 's certainly big market . think question 's right way serve market ? think nvidia 's strategy right much focused open platform -- pc , android , open platform . -- 've business long time . think whole gaming market , lot casual gamer served smartphone- tablet player . mentioned android enabler . high-end gamer served pc game . 's gpu business , solution . room market game console , especially try really medium hub . several alternative medium hub ? 'll actually tell 'm going question . , let 's say , game console market take , game developer enough incentive even develop something pc gaming market ? attention going smaller-sized form factor ? vivek arya rob csongorso right , system data presented recently . share data . website . survey done gdc . game developer conference . number-one platform choice , according survey , right mobile arm . iphone , ipads , android , 51 % . 51 % said platform choice . second platform choice pc gaming , $ 16 billion market , going $ 20 billion . 48 % . game console came 14 % . 'm saying anything -- 'm , want ask game console , ask people . 'm saying certainly , position developer attention , question , data would suggest right , developer focus primarily open platform , mean mobile pc . lastly gpu business . every year intel launch new product . claim , `` well graphic much better . time graphic really much better . '' think haswell , branded separately , like highest end , call iris . look design win 're haswell platform , first , think haswell platform ? , obviously , matter , right , gpu business , adoption high-end platform . secondly , see change graphic attach rate big graphic versus move towards integrated graphic ? want first comment . said number thing . first thing said true . haswell graphic better ivy bridge . ivy bridge better sandy bridge . sandy bridge better came . question , better ? guarantee next version integrated graphic better haswell . question , replace professional workstation graphic card . answer . replace pc gamer's graphic card ? thing 'll say -- n't even take answer . 'll tell answer . read review yesterday -- article came yesterday tom 's hardware -- read review . summary article basically integrated graphic better . 's way gamer professional workstation ever going replace card integrated graphic . reason haswell -- integrated graphic thing got better . kepler discrete gpus got better also . 's part story 's missing . question , integrated graphic solution good enough high-end gaming workstation ? answer . vivek arya rob csongor yes . make sense . maybe let 's shift discussion tegra , favored son , guess , company . tegra -- know , year expectation sale expected ﬂattish . take growth 're seeing tegra automotive side , 're selling $ 20 processor , 're selling complete multi-hundred dollar module , implies smartphone-tablet part tegra going year year market growing substantially . much product transition issue ? much market share issue ? could walk u tegra expected ﬂat year market growing . think first , think , fairly well-known timing issue , 've talked , made conscious decision move schedule tegra 4 order move schedule tegra 4i , integrated part lte modem , well move schedule next-generation apps processor code-named logan . logan brings kepler tegra . made tradeoff . made tradeoff short-term revenue versus believe right strategic thing grow tegra business long term . term revenue -- obviously , mean order ﬂat year , would , obviously , much revenue back-end loaded second half year , dissimilar last year . remembered last year , actually , tegra 2 ramped . tegra 3 n't start ramping . 's basically tablet-centric business . word , tablet start built start released midyear . ramp second half , fall . peak christmas go . look revenue , 's lumpy . get bigger every year . lumpy like . term second half revenue , several new revenue stream exist year tegra n't exist last year . automotive one . automotive right run rate roughly $ 100 million $ 120 million year ramping nicely . 've introduced gaming device year called shield . shield go shelf month . obviously , revenue n't exist last year . case , asp much higher . think thing , difference last year year last year , actually tablet . really -- obviously nexus 7 , 's obviously kindle fire hd -- part , lot people sideline tablet . think year 's going change . think year , 'll see lot tablet . android everywhere . 'll see lot tablet , lot skus , lot type tablet different vendor . vivek arya rob csongorthen finally , think 're going see tegra going new type device . tegra ultimately going phone tablet . fact , think even really refer tegra anymore mobile business . 's simply new computing device . think tegra , think 're going see tegra roadmap basically every part nvidia 's business . going forward , 's basically delivery vehicle gpu something x86 platform . one , think positive surprise work nvidia done 4g lte . bought icera business software-defined radio , certainly expect come actually 4g lte capability tested certified . actually putting 4g lte modem smartphone , tablet ? today qualcomm 100 % market . market demanding good second source . good product , broadcom claim good product . intel . marvell make press announcement every day . competitive perspective 4g lte ? 's going differentiator versus qualcomm , dominates market today ? think , mentioned earlier , believe visual computing increasingly important device . look competition , see 're increasingly talking graphic visual computing . n't think 's accident . think tablet new type device disruptive pc , deliver visual experience used get pc . , % market , 're going care much visuals . 's cost battle . large percentage market , visual computing going extremely important . , competition know . look market data . mentioned twice already . 'll say -- 76 % google 's revenue coming game . 's angry bird . 's madden 13 lot high- end type graphic application . think visual computing , whether 's going automobile , whether going gaming device , whether 's going phone tablet , increasingly going require visual computing . nvidia , phone market , address market volume segment market lte , lte modem . lte modem allows u go door leverage visual computing expertise . meantime , competition everything improve graphic visual computing . vivek arya rob csongorbut fortunately nvidia , world-class visual computing hard . think , look lot people thought would easy simply license arm core imagination graphic core , think lot people realizing simple . think qualcomm understands complex really . that's 're lot licensing core . 're actually investing heavily graphic visual computing . think lte modem important component . 's ultimately . ultimately , differentiation visual computing . got . maybe push back little bit visual computing part . pc gpu side , 've strong graphic . think pioneer bringing lot capability smartphones tablet . look qualcomm , adreno graphic . broadcom graphic capability . simon segars arm present . 're saying mali graphic going go . 's probably going double year . many -- imagination , course , . apple 's claim , course . iphone ipads play game better anyone else , better product . graphic enabled -- believe much better graphic , propel market share phone , right ? 's point 're making ? 'm saying matter lot different device . yesterday -- yesterday computex , asus announced several tablet . n't pick mali . pick intel . n't pick competitor mentioned . picked nvidia tegra 4. ask , `` need level visual computing ? '' , think answer 're seeing lot dynamic happening new device , fact , increasingly . word , thing used matter visual computing 10 year ago graphic , pretty look ? today , increasingly , visual computing -- keep using word `` visual computing '' instead graphic . graphic graphic . 's look . increasingly , order make game , example , realistic , worried graphic . 're worried object behave ? water behave like water ? move character , clothes ﬂow hair ﬂow ? increasingly , think compute capability gpu increasingly important . think application computer vision , think compute , pc . imagine could mobile device . look next-generation tegra device going car , 're looking overhead view car backing . look window , 's camera vivek arya rob csongor vivek aryaﬂoating car . 's looking side creating graphical perspective-correct view look like 're looking . compute well graphic -- together , visual computing . , fortunately u , 's , hard . one thing . look integration capability mentioned application processor modem . look competitor , whether 's qualcomm broadcom mediatek , along application processor modem , also connectivity capability , power management , screen controller . developing rf capability power amplification . see market developing ? need add capability internally , something may acquire outside , like icera modem side ? even necessary ? yes , guess question -- guess one question , critical thing need order win certain design ? , asus tablet announced yesterday , n't think connectivity . 's decided win . think visual computing . think lot integration various component , may matter segment market . 's segment nvidia address . typically , think integration , think cost reduction . mean , connectivity rf . 're using component . overall impact -- think gross margin thing . , happens thing counter . word , spend engineering resource either integrating chiclets , else develop something . example , developed prism capability , allows reduce backlight display 40 % . result , n't use expensive memory . save $ 7.00 bom . 're using software modem . software modem 50 % size . overall chip tegra 4 half size competition . 's much powerful cost contributor whether integrate something . know mean ? 's lot way look overall bom cost device enable . question , 's unique , leverageable -- know , put list together thing could reduce bom cost , important thing u ? look growth , though , market , indeed coming mid-range lower-priced part market , would n't part market rob csongor vivek arya q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - unidentified participantvalue processor baseband integration ? believe market opportunity enable super-phone mainstream price point . perspective , 's cost . would agree . would say matter . matter much , much low end . low end , 's cost . segment we're addressing , 's cost . please let open audience . question answer thank . thanks commentary . nvidia 's successful competing , guess , intel , even though 've significant process laid foundry . 've managed continue competitive . wonder anything changed look 14-nanometer discussion . altera obviously gone . think something changed , process lead significant enough perhaps threaten graphic integrated graphic ? thanks . 's good question . get question quite bit . process technology one component differentiation . fortunately nvidia , number-one differentiator architecture . one way could say apple 20 time faster orange , n't matter well build orange . know mean ? word , end day , architecture gpu allows accelerate application far beyond integrated graphic cpu could . n't matter process could build cpu . make sense ? word , process matter much , much , let 's say , two part identical . two x86 's competing 're le . one better process , case process huge strategic weapon . 's club . case gpus versus cpu integrated graphic , architecture trump process . okay . great . thanks . cost side question , since 20-nanometer look like 's rather expensive -- 's double-patterning number cost high -- node guy still interested ? think competitive 20 , would like skip go straight 16 thin set ? - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongor . 've actually communicated roadmap recently gpu technology conference . variety different roadmaps . involve 20 thin set . 's much devil 's detail discussion . timing performance pricing . 's dizzying analysis . 're actually looking . right , roadmap . okay . think 20-nanometer competitive thin set '14 , ? like said , n't really disclosed much beyond , order really answer question , get detail product 're timing . look presentation material , 'll simply see exist roadmap . n't really disclosed detail . okay . great . thanks . announcement arm recently , new core . wondering seen thought . 're intimately familiar arm . yes , course , 're -- yes , 're familiar announcement . 's nothing new term announcement talk today . think know unique license arm . co-developed unique variant arm 9 went tegra 4i , specifically targeted perf per square millimeter . case , use something 's shelf . case , something little different . little bit ﬂexibility . , 're highly enthusiastic arm 's roadmap 're . gpus traditionally one earliest adopter moore 's law , pack transistor , get better performance . market demand performance willing pay . given like historical animosity versus intel several year . -- last couple year , least -- thing settled , part . would consider using intel foundry partner , came , would go make use potentially altera say going four-year advantage ? q - vivek arya - rob csongor q - vivek arya q - unidentified participant - rob csongoryes , think would happy look . think 'd ask intel , though . think intel set certain requirement 'll work . think 'd ask . sure , yes . intel 's great manufacturer . obviously lot great process technology . whether use , 's good u . 's good industry advanced process technology . anyway , 's good question . 'd ask intel . ready , ready ? yes . would say would look . always talk everybody . think people know work tsmc . reason 're good . said , mean , talk everybody . ultimately , another one devil 's detail . n't believe 's reason would n't look . question ? commented 51 % gamers ' preferred platform mobile , obviously , 's lot opportunity mobile . also commented several time asp increase . 'm wondering , happens overall balance mix asp mobile becomes bigger piece versus , say , pc ? still get blended average asp increase ? start see shift maybe mobility requires better price point ? could talk little bit ? yes , sure . yes . 's good question . referring originally pc gaming business . vivek asked question , asking 's driving pc side . pc gaming asp gone . think may aware announced product year called titan . titan , selling $ 1,000 card . sold . asp within pc market continue grow . gross margin -- know , record gross margin last quarter . think driven large part asp growth . overall , pointed , 'm looking overall business , tegra right lower asp point , slightly lower corporate gross margin . tegra ramp grows much higher percentage , would drag margin . 's thing pushing margin . growth opportunity tesla side . tesla 's far corporate gross margin . q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - unidentified participantwe announced new use gpus go server , called grid . grid gpus go either dell , hp , cisco server . accelerate citrix . may seen announcement two week ago citrix synergy , citrix 's new xendesktop 7 accelerated nvidia 's grid product . announced jointly . ceo citrix ceo nvidia onstage together . growth business pushing , growing gross margin . overall , tegra highly strategic , large market opportunity slightly corporate average gross margin . put take . thank . 'm impressed new lte integrated tegra chip . first , congratulation . may ask smartphone currently adopted great new tegra 4i , including lte modem , first ? 's nothing talk today . please stay tuned . okay , sure . yes . currently right , tegra 4i , guess latest milestone maybe talk , tegra 4i mobile world congress , surprised , think , world showing lte running mobile world congress . running . running phone , meaning 's within power , 's within performance limitation phone . time , competition showed advanced lte . sixty day later , ctia , two week ago , showed cat 4 lte , 150 megabit per second running . 's running chip . word , spin silicon . advantage nvidia's modem software-defined radio . able deliver advanced lte capability using exact chip within 60 day . think powerful demonstration ﬂexibility , design ﬂexibility , modem capability . think one milestone tegra 4i see delivering lte . advanced lte . next milestone track data certification lte q3 . voice data certification q4 . somewhere , hope 'll able answer question , asking customer . maybe follow-up question perspective handset maker , way better -- using combo integrated chip , tegra plus lte , maybe 500 modem chip separately tegra 4 conventional ? way better customer ? thank . - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - vivek arya - rob csongor q - vivek arya sure . think super phone , phone would describe $ 199 , use tegra 4 i500 . think focus really tegra 4i . tegra 4i focused sweet spot mainstream smartphone market , $ 99 $ 199 segment . think 's really focusing effort . integrated chip better ( inaudible ) phone ? integrated chip clearly designed perf per square millimeter perf per watt smartphone . laser-focused . think , end allotted time . thank , everyone . thank , rob . thank much , vivek . appreciate participation .
