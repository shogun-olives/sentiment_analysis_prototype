've got thing like seasonality gaming business , normalization inventory , new h100 , start going cloud instance starting april quarter . , maybe could speak thing thing consider thinking april quarter . correct . given guidance q4 , 're going start-off new year . new year going year focused new product coming market . ada early day right shipping . 've shipped one high-end card , 4090 , 4080 starting sell well . , plenty opportunity innovation 've brought market gaming . 's also true data center business well . data center business coming forth h100 architecture . 's great opportunity really take advantage lot innovation put focus large language model . transformer big thing , overall performance improvement , eﬃciencies , total tco get h100 [ ph ] . start beginning production q4 ; move year , start ramp h100 . discussed term earnings , see cloud instance already set-up h100 start new year well . , know 's important product , feel 're great position new product coming market , h100 data center , networking , often coming coupled together 're selling h100 . 's though ca n't control macro condition , macro condition around world , they're u.s. , 're definitely europe china , 've talked term economy really , really tough right . china important go april , given new year holiday occurs . holiday season asia-pac china area well . 've still seeing solid china , however lockdown 've experiencing covid , make thing little harder distribution , sale process happen . , 'll continue watch closely . q - chris caso - colette kress q - chris caso - colette kress maybe could speak ada launch . think 's perception gaming one pandemic beneficiary , could n't go anywhere would impact thing . extent seen ? 's perception success ada launch compared 30 series , 20 series launch , benchmark ? look gaming , 've always discussed may little bit pull-in folk looked type sport pandemic . see great new gamers joining market taken advantage leadership term gaming . ada leader industry , ampere . , number one number two top architecture nvidia . continue watch see term steam . steam still record level gamers online gaming , top 15 card steam nvidia , 15 15. , area gamers gamers life . watch industry great time also hard time . sport economical , choose many different form factor many different price point gaming want . ada launch 4090 came , yes , first card high-end card , 's sold two week . 're pleased see something nod u knew gaming , matter time year , matter situation still important entertainment industry . okay . 'll pivot data center bit . h100 , maybe speak mean term performance customer , mean term content nvidia ? yes , h100 term performance improvement depending type workload 6x see a100 . went mlperf training mlperf benchmarking inference ; case , hand , everything nvidia show term outperformance . see market led u design h100 continued advancement ai . every season , every year , something new . 're still early day ai , large language model , size large language model inﬂuence natural language processing within front center , say recommendiator engine still way go , popular consumer internet company well make sure marketing appropriately targeted . , h100 really hone ; think development h100 , done coordination q - chris caso - colette kress q - chris casowith customer , coordination enterpriser , coordination hyperscalers , seen would need . move forward , 's h100 tip , system , thinking process ai beginning data enters data center time leaf . , see lot work interconnects , link , networking , memory assist full process . yes . mean , 's good segue next question , sustainable advantage ai . n't think 's much investor question growth rate ai . point , n't think 's much question nvidia 's leadership space ; 's room packed . going forward , sustain ? mean 's factor ? silicon . concern voiced past thing like start-up company taking perch , hyperscalers thing . , fend-off challenge retain advantage ? , think product coming market , may first discus term performance availability . people ask talk see , importantly software 've built along way . software last quarter last year overall developing , 're talking 10 year 15 years-worth developing software platform , really transforming world think computing . computing architecture cpu lot time . use gpu , really rethinking application , 're rethinking use hardware gpu . , full stack view software essential . 're able package create full system package nvaie really help enterprise start beginning work term ai continue term workload 're . sdks leading industry top application , begin work . 's hard think start-up new chip work model , software somebody work work . 3.5 million developer develop solution hardware , software using full system . every time bring something market , 's really developer looking , going use u . , think , 've extremely successful continuing model equally much focus term hardware , focusing development platform , focusing software . - colette kress q - chris casocould give u help think growth rate data center time , 's something 's incredibly different -- diﬃcult model ? part think 've underestimated growth , good problem . going forward , need get despair growth rate within cloud part business , half enterprise business , half . content asp rising well . , think way lot folk done taken look figured multiple cloud growth , 's really accurate way looking . n't know another way nvidia look internally . , discussed earnings , talked business data center , 've broken talking hyperscales , talking vertical industry 're seeing end quarter , probably -- 50 % -50 % . 're going work providing little bit disclosure going forward . hyperscales important , 're large company , many also cloud company term serving cloud instance enterprise . , take time look we're seeing also cloud , give better understanding really vast nature enterprise using ai accelerated computing go forward . , stay tuned u move forward . see hyperscales , setting-up cloud instance need many different type industry enterprise-wise . also researcher , also higher education . seeing period time cloud continuing important part , important part historically likely going forward , think challenge economy setting-up cloud instance get started easier path working significant amount capital build overall data center . , also becoming diﬃcult enterprise real size organization master complex configuration seen data center today . , cloud going important . think announcement made q3 , talking work hyperscale azure , oracle selling enterprise . real good breakthrough 're seeing important cloud provider , also realizing importance relationship enterprise well software stack . , , ability market software stack , create instance enterprise could get , whether built put cloud . , 're really pleased term partnership working cloud provider . mean say time perhaps see cloud part business going bigger part business , maybe see migration on-premise cloud , eﬃcient way dealing workload ? - colette kress q - chris caso - colette kress q - chris caso - colette kress 's tough say different growth rate , 'll still many desire on-prem . stepping back , 're indifferent , right ? 're indifferent whether consumer enterprise want build on- prem , want use cloud instance whether -- hyperscale want . 's 're . many different way use ai , use accelerated computing , set-up throughout world . , 're indifferent . yes , cloud important industry going forward . also want speak one product cycle 're expecting year grace , cpu product get added . maybe could speak term timing , think arm model 're expecting moderate impact second half year . speak mean customer term performance , mean nvidia term content ? yes . , grace . grace first cpu , first arm grace cpu coming market . plan start testing bringing sampling first half . second half , 'll talk market . grace ? grace work together hopper architecture . geared toward large model , high-end type ai . 's general purpose cpu , specific focus accelerated ai together . , excited bring market . worked really understand importance cpu workload ai 'll see second half year . capture value ? obviously , customer buy board grace remove need accompanying intel amd server , cost platform pretty close would a100 today . nvidia position capture value ? 're essentially giving customer better performance , actually remove additional cost . developing system , total tco , moved accelerated computing . n't one architecture data center improving tco . enabling dgx incorporating grace hopper together better tco customer specific cpu workload 're trying . 's uncommon though u also use peer ' cpu well . , within dgx , also beneficial u long 're moving accelerated computing . q - chris caso - colette kress q - chris caso - colette kress q - chris caso - colette kress right . 's safe say 's content gain adding higher performance . nvidia company generally price value . , drive performance , -- market , asp going . yes . price innovation saving tco . 's really underling whether gaming , whether data center , 's 're trying . fair enough . macro concern , mean several -- colleague credit suisse concern cloud capex 2023 , obviously 's pressure enterprise . moderate view h100 grace product cycle go 2023 ? something take little modern expectation expect 2024 ? think ? 've studied 're continuing watch macroeconomic condition . one thing see time enterprise really study work 're going purchase , sometimes lengthening time overall close deal . may happen , though certain industry ai accelerator important work , important monetization platform , important term new growth . , focusing accelerated computing ai , whether sustainability , trying think use energy , 's eﬃcient platform , leading edge ai important many business . , 're good position , new architecture well leader industry . macroeconomic condition though , watching carefully , know cloud essential keep going time . okay . 'll pivot something else , nvidia spoken pretty consistently last year . n't think 's high investor focus , 's software . think software interesting , add software economics semiconductor company model , could pretty important . important expect software financials go next 18 month , 24 month ? yes . , started selling software separately . example , data center product gaming product , software since beginning time . 've done 've packaged key software probably three different area . q - chris caso - colette kress q - chris caso - colette kressone , nvidia ai enterprise , set system software help every enterprise get started essentially treat see many enterprise software capability , able monitor job , able manage whole data center whole essentially get started much workload . 's diﬃcult enterprise start , would n't necessarily team on-board , engineer on-board . essentially , also area , enterprise want software , applying mission-critical application work , want know support , update keep software current . , double win term . , 's first piece . second one omniverse . omniverse important area thinking 3d virtual world simulation much build design -- digital- twin environment 's . 's many different use case . , area , sell pod enterprise customer even individual basis . third piece focusing automotive . 've working automotive term av , agreement , selling software along hardware maintaining software life car . , meaningful piece three area u . 're getting started working selling . 'll even see h100 certain form h100 , come software coupled together h100 . 're excited see . driver top-line , also improvement term gross margin long term . , 'll see drop . 's chance get see software kind broken-out bit granularity near future ? something 've contemplated ? giving information key customer software key milestone reach term software . think would beneficial help walk u journey u . okay . maybe 'll check see , 's packed room , 's question somebody like ask . anyway , 'll continuous think . automotive well -- automotive , 's transition infotainment part business , trended , 've waiting ada full self-driving impact . sound like 're kind edge beginning occur . , maybe could speak bit . correct . 're seeing today , automotive business solid growth right . orin architecture came market important time , q - chris caso - colette kress q - chris caso - colette kress q - chris casowhere 's two important thing automotive industry , ev electrical vehicle well av . , dealing ev customer , 're really thinking complete redesign car bottom , 're building car scratch . important piece computing platform . orin exact great product soup nut . , working consolidating different software one computing platform , also adding av feature work seeing . , nevs across world , particularly asia-pac china area really lodged orin architecture 're using . also agreement large company , daimler , jlr future really provide hardware , full software stack . coming next couple year . start term pre-production , 'll start term sampling little bit year , 'll see term volume . , automotive two thing occurring time . , really -- guess way think 2023 kind going '24 nev , '24 , '25 larger oems.is right way think ? believe 's general direction go . nev -- material ? -- said auto business , 's strong growth , high-class problem 've , strong growth lot different area . , 's kind stayed smaller percentage revenue . get oem , larger like daimler '24 , '25 , expect auto grow significant portion nvidia revenue point ? 's correct . look fiscal year '25 , believe significant amount . keep mind , automotive customer within car important 're purchasing nvidia , 're also important data center customer . order build want av future , computing back data center . 's important part . 've also working course workstation since beginning time . , 's interesting see , yes , within automotive car . keep mind , also great business data center . - colette kress q - chris caso - colette kress q - chris casookay . 're almost time , 'll end question margin . guess nvidia 's case fabulous many product , margin fairly stable anything think regard growth rate different business 're spending consider regard gross margin operating margin ? , looking gross margin , continue see manufacturing cost , remember much engineering 's working software . first , value distribute term innovation allowed u solid gross margin . last year couple year , 've certainly seen cost manufacturing , cost component , contract manufacturing continued increase . 've absorbed lot , still , solid gross margin . take opportunity time look new architecture value 're providing , also take account cost take , high-end manufacturing . , important piece . , look overall operating margin , 's another case strong operating margin . time , always opportunity u think spend money . 're quite eﬃcient company , 're 25,000 people large company 's operating well double-digit billion . took time slow-down hiring focus engineer , focus team . think team rallied around , also continuing look make sure spending money wisely . , focus , focused gross margin long term , also focusing operating margin well . 's great . look like 're time . colette , thanks time . thank , chris . thanks , everyone .
