excellent . 're case study ? yes . eron , n't met , run piece microsoft 's business 'm personally interested think lot . 's sql server side well portion , , bi suite . n't actually take minute n't mind . describe different product set domain ? sure , sure . well first , thank . 's great get invite participate . 'm certainly passionate technology space 're around data platform . 's exciting microsoft . think time , microsoft 's historical brand around desktop , people n't really know 's going sql server . 's incredible business last year . responsibility product management marketing sql server , database , data-centric asset window azure , cloud platform , well bi asset span oﬃce excel , well karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead eron kellyour new cloud property like power bi . 's sort data platform , end-to-end , tend focus . got . know microsoft never like get much detail around sizing particular segment . information metric could offer u help u gauge big business manage ? maybe , n't want put dollar , sql server -- sort largest , second largest , chunk broader segment ? anything give u might help size business ? sure , sure . couple thing , 're actually starting become little bit public actual number help . sql server $ 6 billion business . growth perspective 's growing double digit last several year . q4 number 19 % year-over-year growth . healthy growth . extraordinary . pretty big number . premium part , enterprise edition , growing even faster north 25 % year-over-year . 're seeing lot growth . market perspective , tend look idc gartner well internal analysis . put market share unit perspective 46 % , 48 % . revenue perspective 20 % . , see number 've got lot database unit . 're lower price point . 's also reﬂection historically 've mid-market tier 3 , tier 2 database enterprise . really started change around 2012 release became tier 1. we've got lot indicator showing growth tier 1 u new ground , . okay . -- sql server . maybe lump together . bi side ? several audience follow tableau , click , tibco spotfire , microstrategy . hear microsoft . think investor really good sense big might bi side . metric offer ? karl kierstead eron kellyyes . 's tricky . historically , way 've approached bi market obviously excel client , sql server back-end database sharepoint presentation layer web presentation browser . , across three product , bi business 's easy see single number . think analyst might put $ 2 billion , $ 2.5 billion , across three 're take allocation one . 's probably right . way think , 's billion excel client world , bi course . right , people would estimate within organization 7 % 8 % employee bi function . , lot 's excel . 's product . vision go beyond . vision get 20 % , 30 % , 40 % organization using data make decision . way think familiar tool going big part . also , bringing together right information back end . delivering user familiar way , growth . , sort vision statement like say -- bring big data billion user ? 's 're trying . 's combination new service released february called power bi , per-user per-month service brings together best excel , sharepoint sql bi solution . combine pretty robust back end sql server , window azure , sort one-two combination think really going interesting market . 's strategic view bi sizing sense . super helpful , thanks . one thing eron , 've learned covering microsoft year , helpful statistic , sizing metric , think individual product microsoft part broader whole . 's integrated rest suite . -- extent sql server touch key part microsoft product suite ? link pronounced , worth ﬂagging ? sure , 's couple place . one obviously window server . run sql server run window server 's tight correlation . sql server also back end sharepoint server dynamic , application , within microsoft partner application run sql . visual studio development environment target sql database . 's another leverage point . course , oﬃce excel bi perspective . 've making -- 's sort traditionally . 've making lot investment last two release also make sql socket azure . 've made investment within sql server management karl kierstead eron kellystudio dba life , literally configure backup directly window azure right sql server . , 've tried make lot connection customer looking hybrid environment , data may live on-premises , data may live cloud , want bring thing together . 's big investment . one sort -- 's necessarily data point . statistic thought might helpful , analysis fiscal year business looking attainment sale force . sale account team , account . course care lot attainment . hit number , ? product strongly correlated hitting number sql server . high correlation hit sql number , hit all-up number . 's combination sort connecting effect 're highlighting . 's also deal size getting much bigger around sql 's lot upside 're seeing last couple year . okay . let 's talk little bit sql server business , think investor astonished , honest , 're growing $ 6 billion business high-teens clip , oracle ibm 's db2-informix business probably ﬂat . obviously million dollar question , pulling ? look almost good true . yes . would take back 2010. 's little bit history lesson help get sense 're going . 2010 , released -- called r2 release 2008 product included in-memory technology part analytics bi stack . , first step really bringing in-memory enterprise . starting work tier 1. 2012 really hit tier 1 product perspective . brought in- memory technology core data warehouse brought technology called always-on , creating high availability environment . robust . stuff past around failover pretty good . really good . , became credible tier 1 database . remember earlier comment , sort grew mid-market tier 2 feature n't requirement . could n't command price point . well , 2012 , could deliver mission-critical solution started in-memory across two three main workload database product . time , made two change . made pretty sizeable investment sale force , senior seller . individual seller karl kierstead eron kellywere focused sql server senior typically microsoft , could really go drive bigger deal . , made licensing change cpu-based licensing model core-based licensing model , got alignment oracle ibm already moved . three thing -- product credible tier 1 , investment senior seller could go larger tier 1 deal . business model allows u better monetize . happened 2012. 've really riding last couple year . 's 've seen high premium growth . 're still relatively small player tier 1. 're continuing see upside . see migration , 've tracking 900 migration oracle since 2012 tier 1 application . , thing keep close eye . reason outside observer like u n't seeing progress hit oracle's license number -- effort moving tier 1 workload still relatively early stage . hence n't hit yet ? , possible effect license growth . would call 4 % microsoft . instead 's zero ? 's couple factor . one , lot oracle 's licensing maintenance , right ? 's net new license , 's maintenance . 's little bit number . think 're market 's growing pretty good clip . analyst put 9 % , 10 % . said ﬂat . market 's growing . 're growing faster market 're taking share . -- 're starting see shift . price point lower oracle . 're third price many configuration . 's simple math around . -- move 20 core oracle 20 core sql , going see le revenue , 're going see growth . 's 1-for-1 . 're using price advantage , value advantage , well . 's one key reason customer take closer look say -- gosh , 've app running oracle long time , db2 . microsoft 's brought new in-memory technology market product already know . 's expensive add-on . 're generally le expensive 've got really strong value prop . okay , 'm going start move . thing take time . organization n't want move tier 1 app work unless 's compelling reason . 's winning net new project migration . 'll take longer . karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead eron kellyand eron , portion extraordinary growth sql server might driven another factor -- 's year back , microsoft think , changed licensing model sql server business think resulted net price increase . portion revenue growth 're experiencing sql server price increase ? yes . one three factor . product , sale force investment . change licensing model cpu core . happening , monetizing cpu level . hardware coming core per cpu customer getting performance price . , transition basically like everyone else . 're better able monetize true growth . , 's driving core growth data explosion , right ? data explosion driving core growth across board . lot people think oh , well 's hadoop phenomenon . 's really . 's -- yes , sure , hadoop 's growing 's lot data going hadoop . actually increase demand data warehouse result hadoop deployment get combined existing customer record data warehouse becomes -- creates interesting view customer company . see lot . use example . progressive insurance know , little device car measure driving behavior change rate ? guy -- guy familiar , think ? device create signal data go hadoop . combine data , customer record data life traditional data warehouse . combination 's interesting . growth actually hadoop big data really helping fueling traditional data warehouse part business . 's data project . 's data want actually combine traditional system . great . term product road map , one early announcement new ceo made came aboard sql server 2014. could bring u speed timeline product going ga . new feature pronounced new version ? sure . released sql server 2014 april . 's in-market . biggest new feature area in-memory oltp transaction processing . karl kierstead eron kelly karl kiersteadsql 2014 in-memory technology bi analytics , data warehousing . oltp . 's unique market . one else in-memory across three core data platform workload . 's really exciting release u . 's part reason satya came board announce . last time ceo talk sql bill gate 2000. nice -- course ran division 's familiar technology . n't hurt . 's part reason 's behind , growth potential see . one thing 's interesting phenomenon last couple year traditionally , two three year ago n't case , -- typical enterprise account , largest line item would oﬃce . 's case forever . , 're starting see sql server become largest line item deal . reason sql grow amount data 's amount core process data , whereas oﬃce sort capped number employee organization . , created interesting phenomenon . hit attainment point . 're also seeing large deal size growth -- look large deal , 'll classify $ 5 million sql revenue , 're seeing triple-digit growth last two year kind deal . what's happening tier 1 , customer looking sql , 're buying . combination factor described leading much larger deal size . , enterprise sale force starting take notice , like ooh , wait , used -- used oﬃce big dog every account 's would spend energy . , 's sql thing showing suddenly bringing similar size deal . okay , need learn , need drive . combine market space data , general , interesting time . ga launch sql 2014 recent impact sql server revenue growth 2q ? helped q4 , calendar q2 , certainly buy helped move customer . q4 course biggest quarter . see lot enterprise deal closing . ga certainly helped deal size growth june sure . satya talking also helped sale force could go account say -- look , sql 's ceo-level topic . 're behind . got customer board . eron kelly karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead eron kellylet 's talk nosql . sure . huge topic interest everybody room . 've seen private funding raise , 'm sure , data stack , mongo , everybody . 's unbelievable . 're trying figure big . 's threatening traditional relational database vendor . oracle , might know , arguing 's interesting market 's threatening core relational database business . 's stance nosql opportunity threat ? see opportunity . fact , three week ago , announced new service microsoft azure called document db , nosql database service . reason see complement opportunity nosql database thing little bit differently . different value prop traditional database . 's one . make sense -- make better sense situation versus others . came , two-and-a-half , three year ago , within microsoft large cloud service challenge supporting traditional nosql database n't working . n't scaling . n't level consistency important . say consistency , 's pretty important distinction world typically nosql database read write , quickly 's high performance . n't always keep track absolute result . n't consistent view transaction . eventually reach consistency . think facebook feed example , look news feed , 's always exactly accurate every time . might someone 's post n't show , maybe . five minute later show , right ? lack consistency inherent nosql database 's focused performance , accuracy consistency . difference eventual consistency transactional consistency . correct . looked problem , said , see value schemaless design database developer late game add new data solution without change original schema . thought , valuable . saw value transaction speed . built karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead eron kellynosql database would better meet need allows customer tune consistency . felt like something pretty important data stored nosql database need transactional . 's brought market . see 's great complement . 'll envision let 's say e-commerce site . 're going commerce transaction traditional transactional database must always exactly right . thing like comment , rating review customer e-commerce site , live nosql database want really performing fast . n't 100 % accurate time . , two thing together think interesting . ability really dial consistency dial brought table , think unique . think nosql interesting . think 's great complement we're leveraging lot knowledge experience database world . trying bring . also see similar excitement around hadoop , would think necessarily nosql database . 's nosql data world , realm . committers committed hadoop think 's big part growth strategy well . got . go , make sure 'm good nosql side , reason microsoft would le vulnerable nosql workload migration oracle ? guess would say le vulnerable , mean , price point help . right ? oracle 's price point 's lot expensive . 's going create financial pressure scenario . 's good point . think 's one . think two , azure , nosql database . also , get mongo azure . 're sort embracing choice option . someone said -- hey , want put table sql , want put table mongo , hey run azure , either way . 're seeing upside . think approach , n't know people fully internalized really embracing open source community azure allows u win window workload win linux workload within microsoft portfolio . that's area think oracle 's really position . karl kierstead eron kellythat 's good response . let 's look hadoop , another big trend going data space . back , microsoft started dancing hortonworks partnership . think , 'm mistaken , 've gone beyond hortonworks partnership term -- embracing hadoop . different way microsoft embracing hadoop organization day . maybe broad comment giving perspective hadoop enterprise adoption begin ? feel market ? sure . yes , hortonworks great partner . started partnering two-and-a-half , three year ago . goal really embrace hadoop growth . time , proprietary technology called dryad effectively thing . looked market realized lot momentum around hadoop . people learning . try introduce complementary , competitive thing , n't make lot sense . said , let 's bet hadoop , hortonworks great partner u regard . , 've brought hadoop microsoft . 's part microsoft azure . 's partnership hortonworks , get call hd insight . 's effectively hadoop platform service microsoft azure . hortonworks , hortonworks data platform hdp , window server provide . course also hdp linux . committers microsoft developer actually check code hadoop project . 've contributed lot ip hadoop additional project live top hadoop , like hive stinger . others . rationale , 's pattern 're seeing enterprise . 're seeing hadoop great complement existing data warehouse , brings new perspective customer . talked progressive insurance , also see yahoo ! , originator hadoop . huge multi-petabyte hadoop cluster clickstream analysis go , clickstream data go . move 24-terabyte data warehouse running sql server point bi tool analysis . architecture hadoop next data warehouse access bi tool pretty common architecture . , 's kind pattern 're seeing . hadoop really exciting , course , sentiment analysis , iots , internet thing , 's big area focus . 've got couple customer using one preview service azure around iot . 's fascinating thing . london underground looking vibration wheel escalator determine need replace wheel fails . predictive analytics maintenance , machine learning , scenario . , interesting thing [ ph ] . 're much embracing see great complement traditional business . karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead eron kelly karl kiersteadokay . 've actually got window server question . okay . think fair game throw ? sure . lot trend 've talking , move hadoop , move nosql , extent broader move public cloud -- azure . i'm talking aws others -- , architecture , include commodity x86 hardware generally run free paid linux , window server . i'm wondering data architecture shift . 's linux world , window world , manage transition ? make sure 're relevant architecture shift linux-centric hardware world ? , think 've seen u azure example , run linux vm like run window vm . run hadoop . 're trying expand opportunity data management perspective windows-based workload . also linux-based . azure place 're . , see monetization value data warehouse , bi tool , rest stack . , want make easy possible get data help customer analyze . thing like in-memory technology , creates huge performance gain disk-based solution customer going want move valuable data anyway . see nice complement . let 's talk bi space , part product management responsibility well . 'd like ask 're seeing bi space . think 're seeing traditional bi reporting tool . know , eron kelly karl kierstead eron kellyﬂattish , maybe single-digit growth . feel like lot spending dollar still shifting next gen tool like tableau case , powerview , powerpivot , etc . seeing bi spending shift well . perhaps nuanced shift seeing traditional bi side worth calling ? yes . 're seeing big move toward self-service bi . would highlight visualization tool , ease use become big move market . think 's combination thing . 's ceo c level want data make decision . want employee data make decision . static report fine 're good enough . want able drill data see insight . u , investment powerpivot powerview part excel 2010. native 2013 , example . 's technology sql server team built provides excel team bring market . 's big part bet , power bi service mentioned earlier , big part bet . vision , bring -- give employee organization access data make better decision ? think 's real value creation . company 's historically focused employee productivity oﬃce suite window , think 're well-positioned . bulls-eye microsoft ? yes . 's much path 're going u 's visualization . 's also new , innovative thing make data interactive . one great kind compelling feature power bi service feature call q & literally allows ask question get answer back form data . might ask say compare revenue growth sql server versus window server europe last year 'll get graph back . , help better understand segmentation customer . ask data question . get answer back form graph data point . really , really think 's going take self-service bi next level . 's dashboard see graph chart someone maybe may created . 's literally asking question . , kind investment 're able bring together engineer scientist microsoft research combined bi expert team . even natural language folk bing , create interesting technology think make market really grow . karl kierstead eron kelly karl kierstead q - unidentified participant - eron kellydo think 's feature gap tableau today need close ? area . visualization sure . we're working hard close . think -- 's area 're ahead . like q & example capability n't . think familiarity user excel 's asset . thing 're going certainly take advantage moving forward . okay . let 's see 've got question audience ? 've got five minute left . yes , right front ? actually , want wait mic ? question answer yes . thanks coming today . question around guess we've highlighted , 've hit little bit . ability take share . mean , breadth offering guy enterprise , much guy work together bundle different stuff oﬃce 365 , sql server win business ? also help broad offering hybrid cloud-like environment ? sure . think power bi service example , bundled sharepoint , oﬃce sql per-user per-month subscription . 's tangible example bringing together technology three different group , three different product team , create one offer . think come overall oﬃce 365 say sql server , 's really per-unit bundling make sense . one 's core , one 's user . enterprise sale motion perspective . enterprise agreement , 's becoming something people want together . mentioned , historically oﬃce huge line item ea feedback , n't mess oﬃce renewal , n't really care little sql thing . , 's little bit -- okay , care lot oﬃce renewal . also interested growth get sql . , account team all-up number becoming focused . we've got program discounting thing like , kind help . there's really hard bundle , 's 're looking . - karl kierstead q - unidentified participant - eron kelly - karl kierstead q - unidentified participant - eron kellywe 've got question right ? yes , thing going outside u sql server ? mean , penetrated u market , look like microsoft 's spread business generally ? basically look like microsoft 's spread . 'm -- 'm trying think 's difference . n't think really . see great growth internationally well . 's fun . fun year end year year good year . would get lot e-mail south africa place like , saying - - reached significant financial milestone sql business . end happening sql business internationally , subsidiary much higher growth rate u 're le penetrated . one two large deal -- 's global company smaller country know , data need different global company u . see sort non-linear growth pocket . tend little bit deal-driven , migration tier 2 tier 1. see little bit . might anomaly . think general map microsoft all-up . yes , right ? pricing question , given value bring robustness offering , ability desire close gap oracle moving ? yes 's good thing -- debated quite bit internally sql 2014 release , want raise price in-memory technology 're going put box ? end , said , want maintain significant value advantage really focus share tier 1 , 's non-trivial pas move tier 1 mission critical app one platform onto another . n't want price parity , wanted real price advantage share , share reason . think made right decision 've created lot pressure tier 1 application space , think good . - karl kierstead - eron kelly - karl kiersteadi think 're going get timed shortly . eron , one presentation part number broader data software innovation space . 's recurring theme db event . 're smack middle . wish best luck keeping innovation growth sql server side . thank attending today . great , well thank much karl . appreciate attendance , thank . great .
