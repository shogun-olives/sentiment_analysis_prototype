've company 15 year -- 'm including great plain part existence -- 's long time 've . think externally feel lot exciting dynamic u several year ago . company executing one successful cloud transformation 've seen . think feeling innovation engine really cranking ; 've got great stuff coming research lab . also newfound type openness coming company towards operating system , competitor ecosystem . must excited point ? think mean future microsoft ? sure . well think 's lot thing excited . mentioned great plain acquisition ; come great plain . think one first people , certainly within first week , satya . satya -- running known bcentral . satya became part dynamic business . worked together back also bing day . running 's c & e . feel like satya bringing considerable breadth understanding business , 's worked many different part . think -- 's easier maybe see connected piece . brings new openness , mentioned , partnership . mark murphybut look company come last couple year , think fairly instrumental showing 're going , oﬃce ipad , example , sql linux . example we're really focused embracing customer want . want . environment want run . 's 're either microsoft 're microsoft . think 's new way working world , microsoft product . open-source others ; make work together . think 's really -- 're forming deep partnership . 're working customer run open environment . 're offering product offered past . shift on-prem cloud , thing thing jumped early . think steve started lot ; satya continued , think , continued accelerated way . last thing would say , move cloud world lot benefit cloud . also lot -- everybody cloud . 's expensive business . take lot get scale . feel like 're front end . started early think 're probably -- 's one reason 're leader cloud started early , invested early . good -- think 're good spot . term good spot , actually published cio survey last month , 200 cio responsible $ 126 billion annual spending . one question : moving forward , megavendors critical indispensable infrastructure ? microsoft ( technical diﬃculty ) claiming 47 % vote . actually seen prior year . ( technical diﬃculty ) . interesting looking list . amazon aws came second list ; edged cisco , kind held ground . look composition list , everyone else oracle sap emc ibm lost ground prior survey . want ask : would interpret ? consider ( technical diﬃculty ) change happening level microsoft ? showing u ? dave o'hara mark murphy dave o'harawell think certainly showing trend cloud . aws showing list business n't even exist 10 year ago , barely existed five year ago . cloud think big piece . folk list done better others cloud . think show survey . strictly microsoft perspective , 's great see certainly . think good trusted relationship enterprise . talk u lot need . thing maybe n't -- maybe n't available everybody else . one hybrid environment . see lot customer on-prem , cloud ; 's either/or . really feel need continue getting value investment 've already made on-prem . also augmenting cloud . think offer , unique differentiated . bigger geo footprint think , certainly country good presence . see 're building cloud , want serve country -- want serve geos make sure customer getting cloud wherever need whenever need . think 's probably part reason show high list we're existing vendor . probably lot tech already . want augment even tech . trusted relationship u . one question survey , asked cio much infrastructure-as-a-service work would conducted various iaa platform future year . forward-looking question . asking across amazon aws , azure . also google cloud platform . saw interesting . came 25 % aws ; 24 % azure . would say , going correct , would represent pretty material recalibration market share stand today , right ? would enable type recalibration ? well would step back second say cloud perspective really see cloud -- cloud overall , cloud business overall -- really see even bigger existing business today . think moving mark murphy dave o'harato cloud , inherent growth rate think cloud versus previous setup . think 's going bigger pie . hopefully 'll get share pie . we're working hard get share pie . think lot customer want -- n't want take dependency one vendor . many different workload parse workload . run aws azure . -- microsoft perspective , really look cloud offering whole cloud offering . 's 365 ; 's crm ; 's erp ; 's em solution ; ce core azure infrastructure . think 's infrastructure piece . certainly competitive infrastructure piece . 's value- added service top . think show survey . think customer genuinely looking business one vendor . like offering one vendor . 'll figure way make work together . think , dave , impact price cut future ? think look back , see ( technical diﬃculty ) data aws . incredible growth trajectory . quarter execute price cut . top line ﬂatten sequentially quarter , maybe even minor decline ; get back trajectory . wondering perspective , deal handle price cut ? may executed , may executed others . part question , think inherently part stack time get priced spot market ? commodity part stack compare contrast ( technical diﬃculty ) ip ? yes , n't know 'd use word commodity . would certainly -- infrastructure perspective , 's table stake game . feel like 's core part offering ; really feel like ultimate value service offered top infrastructure . need infrastructure make work . believe infrastructure continue critical part . think 's bigger cloud picture le think infrastructure . mark murphy dave o'harafrom pricing perspective , last couple year last 18 month sane maybe first couple year preceded . 's lot question big . going get share . 're always going competitive price . n't think ever see u lead price . 're certainly going competitive price . time price , cost going well people get scale . think implied , people ask question price , implied whatever price change make cause lose money . believe time pricing get adjusted cost getting adjusted , 're getting benefit scale . still think 's good margin infrastructure business . really 's whole cloud business . let give quick question different type survey also last month . published survey 43 microsoft 's top resell partner -- resellers , distributor , consulting firm , etc . asked rate product term momentum . think , surprisingly , azure oﬃce 365 came first second . think we'd expect . think question commonly get : sustain growth ? business reaching type ( technical diﬃculty ) . see sustainability growth trend oﬃce 365 azure moving forward ? thought overall inning 're segment ? sure . well let talk 365 first . think 've shared number ( technical diﬃculty ) analyst briefing -- time ﬂies , 'd say 's probably year ago -- talked oﬃce transition cloud . said fy18 think said two-thirds exchange workﬂows would cloud . fy18 think half oﬃce workﬂows would cloud . 's even couple year , year , whatever , however want measure fiscal- year perspective . feel like lot runway oﬃce . thing would mention e5 offering launched opportunity provide additional skus oﬃce provide additional functionality . 's got power bi security voice cloud . new offering u . mark murphy dave o'harai think sometimes people look say oﬃce really high penetration . 's upper end market . really believe , one , lot cloud runway left ; , two , opportunity oﬃce ( technical diﬃculty ) bring new service n't offered yet . 's great way . candidly , 's great way cost-effectively , 're already sale environment , 're already talking customer . think 's new offering bring . n't look oﬃce say today five year . really think chance build business healthy way . let 's go directly . assessment across partner term technology , vision , momentum company lopsidedly positive . come clearly survey work . think looking ( technical diﬃculty ) 're looking ? clearly many would referring azure oﬃce 365. technology leading edge ? emerging technology ? maybe product research lab perhaps partner mindful better awareness rest u externally point ? well let get give little longer answer . 'll try keep short . one think cloud perspective n't going many cloud vendor compete ( technical diﬃculty ) . partner , want want new opportunity , partner need go generate new revenue . new market new opportunity mean new revenue partner . think legitimately see microsoft one cloud vendor that's going around . 'll go back second point e5 . new service n't previously offered . new service maybe n't partner strategy past . might company providing service n't embrace partner direct approach ; think partner see opportunity break new category . also think third thing 's new stuff bring customer , rather maybe 've ( technical diﬃculty ) solution last year maybe 's getting little stale . something new talk . mark murphy dave o'hara mark murphy dave o'haraso think 's combination thing . see u viable , see u trusted , see u coming new service , new opportunity go build trust make money customer . ( technical diﬃculty ) . benefit audience , element e5 sku 're referring new , speaking power bi , 're speaking ( technical diﬃculty ) ? well 've voice offering , 've power bi offering , 've even security offering . look ( technical diﬃculty ) e5 , 's lot newness . power bi example , think maybe easiest solution implement n't broad appeal . power bi think certainly easier set , easier run , better appeal consumer . literally power user business intelligence saw value power bi . think pricing strategy go-to-market strategy implies even look ease-of-use , visualization , people look power bi say : hi . applicability broader set customer base . user take advantage , partner perspective , goodness . goodness coming pipeline innovation we're seeing microsoft , think might missing cloud portfolio ? think field lot question build-versus-buy decision . look back , feel like approach much build recently . think 's much build . even look -- going back e5 security offering , couple component company acquired . lot time would acquisition would considered microsoft term tuck-in . 's super-strategic . think security example ( technical diﬃculty ) hard one company catch . always good , solid , organic growth strategy 'll continue . mark murphy dave o'hara mark murphy dave o'harabut think select acquisition augment offering . job put together way make sense customer good go-to-market strategy . 'll continue pursue & opportunity ( technical diﬃculty ) . ( technical diﬃculty ) let 's talk moment transactional versus annuity business . think broadly see many sign microsoft net consolidator spend across industry whole lot new area , gaining scale -- gaining share , excuse , market large-scale . recent quarter , think clear core fundamental remain solidly attached . everything annuity , everything cloud . mentioned larger expected decline transactional business , think part included on-premise server business . actually -- 's okay , want ask question . first one , ( technical diﬃculty ) ? well transactional across oﬃce product server product . . oﬃce server ? geography -- think curious ; almost every company mentioning russia , brazil , china , emerging market generally . saw issue ? extend beyond ? yes . part . couple data point publish : one commercial business perspective , 86 % revenue annuity . percentage growing . 've push get people annuity versus non-annuity ; annuity piece transactional piece . natural transition . get accounted little differently . think 's move somewhat away non-annuity annuity , see goodness . also weakness reason mentioned , mark . 's brazil , russia , etc . market le annuity . mark murphy dave o'hara mark murphy dave o'hara mark murphyso 're talking 86 % , 's across commercial business , . certain geos , 're transaction heavy . would couple geos transaction heavy . step back , think happened transactional . 're trying weigh , could -- could largely macro could effect transition on-prem cloud . using guide try understand driving dynamic ? sure . think 's two thing . certainly two . think geo ﬂavor . also non-annuity versus annuity . think 's lot customer trying figure 're going . going go cloud ? going go cloud ? 's look like ? ( technical diﬃculty ) ? maybe stepping back saying : let 's take long-term view . 're working . think thing contributed probably little softer transaction business expected . gut feel whether transaction softness intensifies , abates , maybe determine going forward ? well think contributing factor . goal really make sure 're microsoft customer . whether choose transact u annuity non-annuity , 're lessening ; 's making sure 're getting service product want microsoft . 're working closely . would say guidance reﬂects see trend transactional business . 'll see play . feel good business . feel good 're . dave o'hara mark murphy dave o'haraokay . want come back -- made comment around oﬃce 365. going back partner survey , looking lens , asked partner look across customer base tell u typical corporate client percentage employee subscriber oﬃce 365 today ? came 39 % . said : think go five year ? came 67 % . 'd say one hand speaks -- 's large increase speaks ( technical diﬃculty ) roadmap ( technical diﬃculty ) . hand , try back implied cagr number , 's high today . interpret ? think could measure 're capturing -- pricing uplift , new logo . forth -- coming back opportunity penetrated oﬃce 365 ? yes , would go back couple stats mentioned earlier , feel like -- view business ( technical diﬃculty ) going ( technical diﬃculty ) cloud fy18 . oﬃce 50 % cloud fy18 . still see good runway ( technical diﬃculty ) . even look business today , think still good , healthy room grow 're confident 're good position . think ask customer -- like ask customer question like -- they're looking oﬃce 's constituted today . n't necessarily see new service offering augment ( technical diﬃculty ) . think oﬃce continue increase footprint . think way show financials price , arpu go think people maybe contracting u service getting someone else previously . result net saving . result net revenue increase u . -- think 's -- feel like good runway existing business 's today new service offering 'll bringing onboard future . quick comment decision point make ﬂagship database , sql server , available first time linux platform ? 's tremendously successful product . 's upper right-hand corner gartner quadrant -- yes . mark murphy dave o'hara mark murphy -- first time . assessed world 's number one database . congratulation , way . thank . decision point drove company keep window platform sudden decide make available linux , think happens year ? think 've also seen -- amazon seems another company calling database industry area potential disruption opportunity . yes . well certainly see lot opportunity within database business data general -- lot really healthy growth company positioned correctly . sql linux really want able give -- want able allow developer write app want platform . 's come . come helping customer , giving customer choice . think people look sql linux say , wow , big revenue opportunity ? -- think ? think long-term lot good revenue opportunity . short term , got lot customer sense relief could continue run stuff 're running . could continue look new option . 's really giving customer choice . n't -- n't focused -- focused ( technical diﬃculty ) saying run want want . 'll figure way make work . think customer saw good current environment future environment . let 's come back ; want ask one two quick question we'll poll audience see anyone would want ask anything . want come back e5 , 've already mentioned couple time morning . new e5 option licensing oﬃce 365. 's top-of-the-line plan . 's primo plan . think understanding e4 really heavily adopted sku . perhaps misperception . think e3 heavily adopted . dave o'hara mark murphy dave o'haraso 're early ; 're early . expect e5 ? anything 've observed far early inning term customer responding e5 ? yes . e5 launched q3 . point , mark , e3 certainly hero sku , though , ( technical diﬃculty ) penetration . felt like e5 good augmentation ( technical diﬃculty ) . look 's available e3s , oﬃce exchange sharepoint skype business e5 . security offering . power bi . voice functionality . 're getting customer lot curiosity going offer n't e3 . think good value prop around . also think look component e5 people would adopt : power bi adopt right away ; security something certainly adopt right away ; voice maybe take little longer . typically see enterprise agreement come due people take look mix say : hi . ( technical diﬃculty ) new offering , think ? give u good opportunity go explain value prop . certainly think lot differentiation e5 e3 . lot goodness ( technical diﬃculty ) ip revenue paying different provider . decide go microsoft . see big opportunity u . mentioned voice . want go topic , skype business . we've seen lot indication strong potential product . team recently talking potential cause microsoft spending uplift future year . could walk u ? think 're trying understand whether ( technical diﬃculty ) communication market skype business ? would describe way . voice complicated , anybody run voice infrastructure know . 's something n't throw . think even cloud on-prem -- question get : think world going ﬂip cloud ? 's going ﬂip . 's transition 's orderly transition . mark murphy dave o'hara mark murphy q - unidentified participant - dave o'hara q - unidentified participant - dave o'haravoice probably ( technical diﬃculty ) nobody going -- 's unlikely company going go ahead throw pbx move u . might ( technical diﬃculty ) organization time . might literally say : hi . 're bringing new building online . 'll go use voice solution building . people n't want lose communication capability . thoughtful . think -- think time ( technical diﬃculty ) opportunity u . think 's -- way voice similar little bit erp crm app , n't throw start day one . 've got build toward . see good long-term build opportunity u . quick boom solid , long-term ( multiple speaker ) solid , long-term multibillion-dollar market . okay . moment left . n't check question audience ? would , raise hand question . microphone right center aisle . one right . question answer thanks . talk recent growth sql server business competitive dynamic business ? sure . missed first word . type growth descriptor ? recent historical growth . recent ? recent growth , okay ; thank . feel -- define sql strictly license database think look upper-single-digit growth . felt -- feel good , mark 's earlier ( technical diﬃculty ) we're positioned market . feel good sql . feel good we're positioned relative competitor . q - unidentified participant - dave o'hara q - unidentified participant - dave o'haraso think opportunity u go take share existing competitor . think market overall grow . analyst mid-single digit , maybe little stronger ; would certainly expect get share . see growth market term license database . also think sql azure grow along size market well . look sql , really look sql across cloud on-prem . on-prem perspective , certainly expect 'll pick share along way on-prem perspective . provide thought key success factor sustained competitive advantage service ? sustained competitive advantage service ? think need infrastructure support service , 're big cloud build . need service easy set , easy digest . easy use . state obvious point , need service people want . think microsoft perspective term think competitive differentiation , enterprise perspective 're account ; trusted relationship expensive build . take long time . hard replicate . 've got . think got right service , right go-to-market strategy relationship customer . infrastructure . transaction slowdown , much self-inﬂicted versus ? 's hard parse . get much precision ; go say : okay , much due shift non-annuity annuity ? estimate much . say : much due thing like geo-specific issue ? estimate much . would say say transactional slowdown , would also put context , transactional slowdown around $ 100 million $ 12 billion - mark murphy - dave o'harabusiness . n't see -- 's armageddon stretch . -- would say shift , geo weakness , probably little bit unknown . tried build view future . okay , , time . dave , thank kindly spending u . great . sure . thanks , mark . thanks .
