's team 's responsible everything around data analytics , on-prem public cloud , starting sql server product , on-prem database managed service azure , operational database , sql , course , open source , everything around nosql analytics governance data . 's basically team lead . microsoft 21 year , grew engineer working window team moved sql . 've ever since . share ironic thing . worst -- majored engineering back india . worst programmer campus . could program job run mainframe . decided software analyst instead . 've blast . ironically , good programmer , would programmer would chance cover industry 20,000 foot altitude related . 're 25 year , believe failed programming , i'm covering software industry coming 25 , 26 year . funny -- slightly embarrassing self-disclosure background way , let 's talk topic people 's mind , coronavirus impact . look like microsoft 's azure business actually benefiting . talk customer buying behavior priority might changed better worse respect coronavirus particular line work azure data side ? thanks question , kash . 's obviously relevant important one . first foremost , would say focus , frankly , helping customer , community , employee partner , dealing challenging time , definitely first responder , health care worker priority azure , fact , microsoft . definitely , point , seen growth azure consumption , particularly look workload enable remote work . mean think 've publicly spoken growth usage microsoft team , , course , internally relies lot azure -- core azure service . 's definitely area 've seen growth . workload , course , virtual desktop , window virtual desktop usage active directory . specifically , 's interesting , called , look data analytics business , 's fascinating . satya sort mentioned , 've seen two year ' worth transformation couple week . definitely see several industry looking digitally transform . last , 'd say , least 3 , 3.5 year , 've conversation several enterprise customer , medium really large one , around digital transformation , could related -- everyone 's looking becoming data-driven company decision made based system actually give insight needed . could around better engaging customer , building better product . even class like saving operational cost deep understanding value chain . heart , transformation cause modern data platform , especially heavily focused cloud-native design allows economically scale , predictive analytics , 's -- 's journey lot customer . apart newer renovation , -- say 's lot cost saving element well , right , 're able sort really pay service 're using 're pre-provisioning lot resource like on-prem . anything , 've hearing several customer journey looking happened covid way significantly expedite transformation . sense , feel given disruption 're seeing happen around digital transformation , definitely see trend 's going positive impact data analytics business . specifically , look -- i'll sort speak product like synapsis , unified analytics story launched ignite last year , 's significant interest customer leveraging synapse simplicity creates , everything data integration data warehousing big data analytics single unified product , right ? 's cost element customer looking saying , look . move cloud-native service significantly reduces time cost ? - kasthuri rangan - rohan kumarand -- -- operational side , course , 're seeing significant growth migration . imagine existing sql server customer looking move workload public cloud save cost build intelligent application extending workload . thing see cosmos db , lot nosql workload around mongo , cassandra , draft database . essentially , lot customer looking moving -- expediting move operational database sql , cosmos db open source offering . got . specifically , covid , rohan , catalyzing ? think 's two thing . definitely value piece , would say , kash , every industry point looking investment 're going make -- specifically , -- whole cost element , right , save . -- discussion happening , business requirement n't go away . anything , look driving business based clear insight , becomes even important . investment make modernize data platform , analytics platform , anything , urgency built . discussion covid 're saying , okay . 's innovation piece . actually get lot value term lower cost ? right ? 's really look one key piece innovation , customer expecting , modernize data platform , ton friction today , like look -- 'll give specific example . look modernizing core enterprise data warehouse , may -- customer on-prem system like multi -- like massively powerful processing architecture , scale-out design , effectively , many way , reached limit term far scale . go system something public cloud , amount service need stitched together create solution high . problem realized three , 3.5 year ago , working service called synapse , greatly reduces friction . 's term time insight cost take , amount engineering effort need stitch together drastically reduced , right , directly translates saving time , saving cost , maintenance software n't need write , system taking care . - kasthuri rangan - rohan kumarso covid , 'd say , definitely pushed -- discussion customer really pushing understand aspect , , okay , great . digital transformation , continue journey obviously . covid pushed forward thing reducing cost . aspiration n't go away , discussion turned lot value creation piece . make sense ? absolutely . certainly . quick reminder client dialing dialed , wish ask question , please chat question portal . pick , 'll pose . mention name . sound really smart question going come . 'll take credit smart question , identify name . another question , rohan . microsoft certainly software company talked increasing usage azure platform within set customer certain vertical , whereas vertical seen usage come . net effect azure business , versus ? , 's good question . say , 's expected , right , mean , every customer sort speak every industry , almost across board , everyone sort going , challenging time , right , term situation find . fascinating , though , like take look certain aspect clearly changing fast pace . one talk whole notion remote everything . like foundationally changed people work . foreseeable future , sort going remain . satya mentioned , discussion 've maybe cio , ceo , ctos , term investment plan make , like everyone 's effectively acknowledged pace 're transforming sort become , significant . 's clearly call reduce tco maintaining innovation agenda . 're looking business continuity plan . mean , 's pretty big thing look . 're getting people like , hey , happens specific region accessible , ensure business continues ? overall , believe well positioned capitalize trend given offering , change term work , live 're seeing also , like mentioned previously whole push towards getting -- data-driven culture insight truly driving business , mean invest data platform infrastructure . - kasthuri rangan - rohan kumarnow term overall trend , say , especially azure business , security , productivity apps , basically -- business application , investment making developer , seeing ton traction around . specifically , look -- take look structural change , whole play digital twin iot , 's sort see 's lot traction happening around whole notion like replicate lot iot infrastructure quickly make progress . everything around smart building , automated factory , remote selling , curbside pickup , given restriction , leading area , past , n't maybe seen lot growth change 're seeing . overall , would say , 's hard sort -- clearly , certain vertical , definitely seeing lot believe temporary contraction deal challenge 're going , absolutely remain bullish encouraging view future hold given offering . wonderful . used microsoft sql server highly regarded . like 15 , 20 year back , people would always consider oracle database sabre database truly enterprise-worthy database , microsoft sql server departmental installation . buyer survey . perennially , period time , microsoft always come second third term consideration . last two year , microsoft shot # 1 position respect customer looking , oracle slipped # 2 position . happen ? mean future database market ? insignificant market . even bigger cloud computing market stand . course , cloud computing market , compute storage going naturally overtake database . database highest value item sector . 's always baï¬ „ ed spend $ 40,000 per processor spend $ 3,000 , $ 5,000 per instance operating system . highest value part stack job coming left field rising term customer priority . talk u significance going forward , rohan . thank . think 's great question . first point raised around sql server 20 , 25 year ago , departmental database . mean 's fact , right ? mean take look sort started , clearly , oracle others market long time . especially came sort remember back 2000 earlier , 's 2000 2005 , time sort joined sql server team well . part clear lot departmental apps , like tier 2 , tier 3 kind workload , sql server gaining prominence . point , question around , hey , really running tier 0 , tier 1 mission-critical enterprise workload . say , kash , last -- definitely last almost 20 year , 's two thing , clearly focused , course , driven term technology trend 've seen , -- relationship 're building enterprise customer learn best serve . 's two thing . one , clearly , make substantial investment , 've done several release culminating right , recently sql server 2019. look journey started sql server 2005 , pivotal release term making like fairly substantial change architecturally enable high scale , high throughput , low latency . ever since , 've expanded total type data 're dealing . look focus 've around high availability , disaster recovery , focus in-memory processing , looking hardware trend , leverage ssds , lot better gpus . recently , look process memory , 's still becoming big thing . 's laser intentional focus meeting need highest class demanding enterprise customer . 's one part . thing really around -- focus around developer experience , ease use . frankly , reï¬‚ect back , thing really got u successful enterprise whole combination dev tool experience microsoft building inside .net visual basic . ease , ease managing . core aspect making thing easy , database complex , , critical . fact , 's one piece feedback heard adoption sql server grew n't learn like 50,000 different knob go set database . 's lot intelligence embed make thing easy . wanted build highly performant application , n't rocket scientist , right ? course , 's certain amount understanding system , relational model , relational algebra see thing . - kasthuri ranganbut 's constant area focus u , make simple . part , like reï¬‚ect back , kash , genesis azure , -- go back mission , talk empowering every human every organization achieve , 's really basis come u tool company sort provide make thing easy . 's fascinating . mean , 've seen several analyst , course , like mentioned , lot report , coming across preferred vendor run mission-critical application . last four , five year , -- actually -- hypothesis foundationally changed u put u right top data platform deep understanding enterprise customer market heritage sql server grew . look pivot since 2010 've made cloud computing , offering manage sql server , open source database , we're getting big analytics , fairly wide portfolio service offer . speak lot cio , frankly , ctos , say , look , prefer sql , prefer microsoft path towards -- -- want sort bet company well positioned future . investment make , let 's say , on-prem today , even though may move cloud next maybe one three year , ensure investment made around app model , business model , et cetera , carry forward . , humility , say , believe data platform , tech innovation 've done business model innovation ensure customer 've betting sql server get significant value move cloud super beneficial . focus like performance scale , ease use developer long-term bet , given portfolio cloud innovation agenda , really resonated well customer . sorry , long-winded answer , wanted â€ “ passionate , completely appreciate . look paas market , think mike schutz [ p ] h said number year pivot within azure cloud business paas . paas certainly higher value , higher retention , higher margin , le capital-intensive , albeit versus compute storage . talk u future paas business look like microsoft ? biggest thing microsoft investing successful -- paas side ? sense exposure paas lot higher percentage overall business relative , say , amazon google . microsoft 's legacy . 're really -- came , right ? - rohan kumar - kasthuri rangan - rohan kumar absolutely . talk u little bit aspiration paas ? . mean -- , say , think , -- point view really believe , kash , investment going happen future . 's multiple trend going right . 's clearly element call lift shift modernization lot customer strategic asset term application workload want move cloud . course , want move cloud little investment side term change need make , right ? 's whole -- look trend like , offering paas significantly improved term compatibility , see -- sort reduce change need make , 's easier move , let 's say , application deployed virtual machine on-prem , basically want rent virtual machine cloud host . 's definitely , term friction , 's easiest way . belief , , course , -- huge business around infrastructure , support customer window server sql server , 's key play u , migration motion . look future application written , especially sort start thinking around intelligent cloud intelligent edge , application tend distributed , paas layer enables focus lot business logic , scale requirement worry much underlying resource getting provisioned , right ? look like new server-less micro service design becoming extremely popular among developer community , inherently , foundation , require paas service , let 's say , data layer , right ? offering need , purpose build , let 's say , need relational database , need nosql database , want sort use open source like postgres , mysql mongodb , -- developer preference . compatibility important , notion creating vm , provisioning desk , provisioning network , tying together , complexity making sure 're behind -- securely locked behind virtual network , thing , effectively , paas layer make greatly simplified . think time build application , get ready , get app running going , question -- strong point view , investment made path , like service - kasthuri rangan - rohan kumarhave data analytics side , way sort thinking function app model basically write code compute get provisioned sort get going , simplicity developer creates going pretty amazing . look app usage right , would say migration definitely , strong play . believe play next maybe three seven year , time , believe lot lot new application , 's going written paas model . heard one resellers last fiscal '19 , believe , wo n't mention number -- expose anybody , certain number database installed incumbent market leader actually replaced microsoft azure sql server . talk u hearing customer partner respect appetite , completely made , replace on-prem database , albeit superiority what-not microsoft cloud-based database ? lot discussion around . 's -- 's two , 'd say , maybe broadly two thing driving discussion , kash . first , course , general approach towards like company imagining , hey , sort digitally transform , -- compute data footprint look like , right ? natural thing around , okay , n't want sort manage data center , want manage physical machine , n't want manage power everything come . strategic bet around , okay , let 's go move workload public cloud . part , obviously every customer looking spend , may using different version on-prem database on-prem , they're looking , okay , move cloud , term modern architecture , 's cloud-native design help move , transition ? even may first step , may move iaas-based model , strategic workload strategic application , get design point essentially help scale , save cost , help build intelligent workload 'm able leverage machine learning ai way take forward ? basically discussion around -- independent database sort coming . healthy trend term migration see even competitive database , on-prem , sql server , even thing like postgres , thing like cosmos db , depending nature workload 're running . -- move eventual paas service essentially give assurance , right ? like , believe specific application going strategic five year - kasthuri rangan - rohan kumarnow , making investment essentially modernizes , -- performance , scale , security , ease use , predictive intelligence , integrating , 's lot high-value capability 've added paas service . definitely see lot discussion around . fact , say migration , sql server , lot on-prem database corresponding workload cloud , # 1 motion . 's amazing . always like simplify complicated thing technology industry easy understand term . way explain 's going database market , would say client , look . ferrari great car , use case uber different . -- people margin want uber . n't need ferrari . 's would characterize shift database market on-prem -- 's question , incremental demand coming uber . couple minute , 'm curious get perspective . azure's competitive advantage differentiation aws gcp . want stick database , 's okay . broader perspective , think edge aws gcp ? got . yes . . think 's -- 's fair question . fact , get asked time . thing always sort start , , course , 's important aware trend , investment going , thing fundamentally drive innovation agenda 're hearing customer , point view get built term best serve . 's -- 's interesting 's like -- take look day , 'm lot worried , hey , issue customer running 're getting signal 's really richest thing term investment make . thing normally share 've heard customer , right ? like 're successful azure , basically share multiple thing . thing many way sort stand focus around enterprise security governance . thing 've learned , worked customer 25 year , -- lot talk performance , scale predictive intelligence ai going change world , true great , reality biggest thing customer worry look major transition like , hey , environment going secure ? 'm putting data somewhere else , guarantee 're providing around encryption , isolation , given everything else 've heard around leakage , et cetera , right ? basically , trust around microsoft offering . 's interesting , look like 've led lot product core capability we've built around security , privacy , governance data sort leading , 's customer tell u , hey , unique strong point view , resonates well , especially one regulated industry like financial service , health care , government , manufacturing . really resonates . thing , like said , sort brieï¬‚y discussed whole -- focus around current lift shift really need maybe next one three year , believe world evolves . like specific pattern talk customer deep engagement manner around , depending business need , depending time frame 're looking , could go path iaa first pick strategic workload . longer lead time , sort short circuit . 's thing heard customer -- microsoft clear point view based requirement . n't force go , go . 's always discussion based -- talk we've learned , right ? many case , migrating different database may best option 're looking completing move , let 's say , within three month six month versus coming , saving cost really looking transition , could take little longer . part , clear point view future believe , believe , also always talk microsoft . u , offer service , kash , 's -- one thing always talk customer presentation , let tell microsoft evolved decision made make ? - kasthuri ranganand ambition , really , satya effectively made one requirement u , azure computer entire world microsoft , course . talk journey , best making , resonates well . 's something different selling whole bunch service product customer , lot learning , microsoft scale we've , help u create clear point view . finally , look publicly 've spoken investment iot , intelligent edge , believe going become critical , 's cloud . 's application future . almost everything 's connected going intelligent . could consumer device . could manufacturing plant , connected car , whatever . invested last three year application model give consistency across . n't worry deploying arm device , low power ? deploying public cloud , like thousand core . programming model consistent , security aspect consistent . people get understand , 'll realize consistency , like today , example , sql server , 'll give example , run everything arm device , maybe le 1 gb 1,000-plus node running synapse query , right , across petabyte data . developer , write t-sql , security model , built-in ai exactly score . that's super powerful , right , application become distributed . actually think -- part come genesis , understanding developer community broader reach 're open source right . thing 'd call stuff customer tell u differentiated , help u sort build agenda . hopefully , useful . absolutely . -- 're end allocated time , in- depth , insightful . thank much , rohan . thank , jonathan , always , support , everything conference . , quick announcement make . believe next presentation , one -- colleague , wamsi mohan , first - rohan kumarchat michael dell , ceo dell technology , , 'll ceo workday , aneel bhusri . 've got plenty good presentation throughout day next couple day . please consult agenda . , rohan , , thank much . jonathan , thank much . lovely day . tank much participating conference . thank much .
