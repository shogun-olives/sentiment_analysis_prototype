good afternoon everybody , thank attending deutsche bank 's virtual technology conference . name taylor mcginnis , 'm one software analyst deutsche bank . ending great lineup keynote high note tom keane , microsoft 's corporate vice president azure . tom , thanks joining , great . well , thank . perfect . begin q & , would like remind everybody submit question via chat box left side screen . , let 's get started . tom , believe 've held several different role microsoft year part azure team quite time . start , might helpful audience give quick introduction current role microsoft . yeah . absolutely . , taylor , thanks . sit engineering team cloud computing division microsoft , 'm responsible cloud computing infrastructure around world . 's place driving expansion cloud data center , underlying engineering 're make cloud work sophisticated customer across industry , solution 're building industry range commercial industry government . prior working azure team , involved standing oﬃce 365 cloud service . prior , worked number server product . taylor mcginnis tom keane taylor mcginnisover last 20 year , 've busy microsoft whole bunch fun exciting thing . perfect . 's great introduction . well many others listening following team closely several year . believe first time azure business faced downturn challenging environment . high level start , based recent conversation customer , share key trend within azure conversation evolved relative past quarter ? noticing significant shift type workload deal momentum would interesting ﬂag group ? yeah . look , 's great place start . obviously , 2020 pretty incredible year term different environmental factor . satya described 've seen well , saw two year digital transformation occur first two month covid-19 . become clear we've moved 2020 , business digital foundation digital technology place resilient able handle challenge covid-19 brought . look digital transformation 's occurring , 's clear 've seen acceleration customer remote work initially provided mechanism allowed people , course , continue operating growing people expect capability available wherever working . 've observed microsoft cloud computing adoption covid broken concern may existed inside organization around , particular workload ready cloud particular scenario could performed remotely , 've seen many customer begin , example , stand , course , team collaboration technology , window virtual desktop , solution allows customer run window 10 cloud . digitally enabling set application connection stand business . really , 've seen accelerated adoption large set customer , also breaking historical concern accelerating plan already place make use cloud . okay . 're hearing vertical like e-commerce communication seeing greater demand may drive cloud usage , others travel hospitality , may looking downsize . first , net ? durable existing consumption growth environment , given pricing model never really tested scale downturn . hard -- easy hard scale workload ? tom keane taylor mcginnis tom keane yeah . 've seen interesting behavior customer , 'll give couple different example make real . first , obviously , covid resulted lot customer needing make service available customer digital mechanism . building new application cloud-enabling existing application , , course , resulted additional usage azure . 've also seen initially little bit surprising , , fact , became quite obvious , acceleration customer plan move workload cloud way saving money . example , many customer 've working , created plan move large workload cloud , plan short medium-term horizon . workload like sap , high-performance computing place organization may invested heavy capex on-premise infrastructure . 've actually observed covid even industry may structural downturn cloud plan actually accelerated . 're moving aggressively cloud way reduce on-premise spend use ﬂexibility cloud provides scale workload . whilst may downturn immediate term certain industry , industry , fact , accelerating . 're capturing across various different workload . trend 'll call , 'll certainly , 'm sure , talk , move tier 1 workload cloud . covid shown cloud resilient . 've become effectively critical infrastructure underline many positive society right . given lot customer ' confidence move sophisticated workload , important workload cloud . tier 1 workload highly available resilient power business , customer feeling comfortable standing , 're seeing different industry like financial service sovereign wealth fund others using cloud different way result confidence 've built 2020. yeah , 'd love talk 're seeing tier 1 workload we'll talk little bit later . topic secondly , experiencing impact customer looking optimize consumption resource effort save money time ? wondering elaborate impact 's azure growth ? taylor mcginnis tom keaneyeah . course , advantage cloud allow customer continuously optimize . want help customer save money , use resource eﬃciently ensure infrastructure set right way . continue daily helping customer use cloud eﬃcient way . 's absolutely customer able use cloud save spend configure workload way 're financially line expectation . 've also seen , mentioned earlier , digital business providing significantly agility robustness . , actually driving increased usage cloud . customer moving workload . , expectation continue grow . , workload 're moving often highly available , higher resiliency expectation . mentioned , tier 1 workload . , course , making use different aspect cloud . bottom line , yes , 're , course , continually helping customer optimize usage resource , 're also staying laser-focused adoption , leading indicator success focus adoption partnership customer allowing move important workload . understood . last quarter , microsoft talked continued strength customer signing large long-term azure contract . initial field work suggested covid environment may led slowing deal activity migration . seem materialized significant way . 's interesting even commentary talked acceleration term tier 1 migration . , 'd love get thought . way , guess , could check wrong ? would characterize customer ' priority today 's environment impact that's azure 's business ? yeah , obviously place work lot customer talk customer every day . think 's worth explaining value system , always looked customer relationship partnership . partnership 100 % focused joint success , getting customer adopted using technology go power business optimize internal cost structure . one thing 've ensure 're providing highest level understanding different customer different industry highest level value driving industry-specific investment . offer customer different industry , prepackaged solution , product capability meet specific need . , course , 'll continue , satya amy hood , cfo , clear help customer migration , ﬂexible contractual model . consumption trend seen proof point deal non-linear . taylor mcginnis tom keane taylor mcginnisand consumption model give lot ﬂexibility . hyper- focused building partnership customer helping adopt move cloud . make sense . 'd love dive topic partnering customer helping facilitate migration . since significant implementation re-architecting cost associated migration microsoft offering -- guy offering resource financial ﬂexibility term contract payment term help facilitate movement on- premise cloud environment ? maybe similar note , know microsoft talked possibility customer prefer pay-as-you-go contract large multiyear azure commitment given current uncertainty ? seen material shift ? partner customer , hyper-focused enabling build cloud foundation . one element digital foundation often cloud control plane . building foundation allows implement security , privacy , compliance policy way organization make use cloud , different business requirement , compliance requirement even cost requirement factored digital foundation . give organization confidence make use cloud inside boundary . boundary financial . 're absolutely seeing adoption around , mentioned earlier , tier 1 workload . tier 1 workload broadening different industry . example recently , 've announced lot work 're around 5g connectivity . 've done number acquisition support technology allow core communication infrastructure running top azure . open , course , total addressable market . , whole range different option customer consume . part partnership , ﬂexible different way customer want work u . focus adoption leading indicator success . got . 'd love dive guide financials . intelligent cloud guide microsoft september-end quarter implies le moderation azure growth rate saw july-end quarter . , much driven consumption trend normalizing customer adjust covid landscape ? migration returning pre-covid level , 're still yet ? tom keane taylor mcginnis tom keane look , 're hyper-focused adoption every single day . look interaction 'm customer , 're seeing large workload moving cloud , cloud-native cloud migration . example , 've talked lot work 're ubs , swiss investment bank . they've moving key workload cloud well building cloud-native workload complex area like risk management . 've done lot work 've talked publicly chevron , 's allowed chevron work energy eﬃciency green energy make use cloud digital foundation well new application 're building allow open new area business . 've done work government . veteran administration , example , able build bridge serve veteran united state making use digital technology elastically scaling application , matching patient doctor eﬃciently . result , reducing risk challenge covid provides . three example example organization continuing migrate scale , 've put place , digital foundation , control plane . 're also building cloud-native application business service provide citizen continue evolve . , 're really continuing see demand across dimension . topic , thought share shape full recovery might look like azure throughout year next ? think u , hyper-focused helping customer industry adopt cloud . start , mentioned , control plane foundation . work customer across different industry , 's ensuring cloud digital foundation existing business well foundation future business . one hyper focused area u work 're around data understanding different schema data industry using . 're , example , providing 100-plus different solution customer retail , consumer good , healthcare allow data product natively understand different industry . , give customer confidence move data cloud , knowing cloud understands respective industry allows go build cloud industry-aware application easily make use new technology like predictive analytics insight visualization . taylor mcginnis tom keaneso look , customer little different , industry little different . 's clear many industry growing incredibly rapid pace . pace accelerated 2020. obviously , retail , use cloud computing people move online shopping significant , 've spoken publicly work walmart allow elastically scale grow based business need . similarly , europe , 've talked partnership h & . area like financial service , interaction point become different , 're using cloud allow use high-performance computing effectively decouple constraint place may historically compute constrained . 're even moving new segment area like space , 're making use overhead imagery help farmer eﬃcient united state help department agriculture understand environmental pattern . say 're seeing lot growth lot different industry thing remain constant consistent u . 's interesting . thanks sharing . want switch gear . 'd love get thought internal data center eﬃciencies microsoft realizing , , turn , course , helping drive really strong gross margin improvement azure . last quarter , microsoft mentioned extending server networking equipment useful life four year -- sorry , four year , three two year , respectively . provide color driving ? opportunity still eﬃciency gain ? yeah . obviously , covid 've gone two year digital transformation two month provided u positive problem tremendous amount demand . 've incredibly focused customer ensuring resource need order successful . look cloud computing infrastructure , 're continuing optimize . covid show strong demand short period time . course , microsoft , inside azure business provide resource customer also resource built top azure inside microsoft . example , microsoft team , communication collaboration experience built top azure . enormous growth saw team result able expand azure platform drive eﬃciencies real time . physical element cloud n't move overnight . software literally . saw initial month covid azure making significant taylor mcginnis tom keaneimprovements allow team scale meet first wave demand came covid . look inside data center , 're constantly innovating driving improvement . 's based supporting customer ongoing demand moving faster support demand , 's also economic well physical advantage u . example , 've talked lot use green energy energy cell way driving innovation consume power well removing dependency . yesterday , announced publicly we've brought seaﬂoor scotland 110 foot underwater , underwater data center . whilst may seem like crazy idea , 've actually seen phenomenal viability concept 've driving research , nothing short incredible see . continue drive eﬃciencies data center world . continue grow footprint support customer key thing happening across software , 's happening across hardware well across physical environment data center reside . right . interesting example addition mentioned guy public term technology helping drive eﬃciencies . outcome , window actually implemented ? yeah , mean , one theme think really important touch , especially covid , cyber sovereignty . microsoft long time firmly believed -- fact , inception , believe need enterprise . one clear need enterprise , commercial enterprise , well government cyber sovereignty . covid , many country around world many multinationals think lot sovereignty . good come ? supply chain ? data stored ? line strong belief importance cyber sovereignty , 've building data center around world . today , azure resides 21 different country . last six month , 've seen u make announcement expand cloud even country . 've seen announcement 've made publicly around building , example , place like mexico . 're expanding europe location italy expansion asia pacific region even growth africa emerging market . taylor mcginnis tom keaneand certainly , cyber sovereignty allowed u grow existing footprint eﬃciencies described . also grow cloud around world customer deeply value data residency cyber sovereignty . give u way ﬂexible closer customer want capability capacity meet local rule regulation , super important go serve restricted market like government , financial service , health , life science increasingly , even supply chain manufacturing . 's another place innovation 've made economics back end , allow u eﬃciently effectively go scale globally meet cyber sovereignty requirement . yeah , want press little bit , 's probably overlap term question 'm ask mentioned . let's dig little bit data center expansion . first couple month post covid , spike usage across certain workload certain geography , reportedly led data center outage . look last quarter , capex spend increased significantly q1 guided similar level spend . thinking ensuring suﬃcient capacity , guess , meet growing cloud need ? 'm sure 're talking , technology enhancement guy making sure data closer customer . weigh decision around expansion new data center region versus increasing footprint existing region ? yeah . look , 's multiple part , 'll talk . mean , first , 're incredibly focused ensuring customer use cloud grow scale . covid , course , unpredictable event . saw microsoft team , example , cloud able scale literally overnight grow level nothing else ever represented seen customer around world . fact global cloud infrastructure allowed u scale incredible way . 've also done ensure customer grow focus first , customer critical industry , justice public safety , police force example , human life critical workload , 've prioritized focused . lesson learned term providing additional capacity , 've able respond ensure customer continue grow . place continue optimize supply chain , software well hardware respond customer demand wherever demand quickly possibly . look global infrastructure , hyper-scale hero cloud region , north america , europe , amsterdam ireland , increasingly location , , singapore , australia , united kingdom . we've lot work , pre-covid post-covid continue grow hyperscale footprint large location well emerging location . taylor mcginnis tom keane taylor mcginniswith , 've delivering capacity location . 've done pretty good job supporting team communication collaboration , critical customer life safety , customer essential restricted industry like financial service healthcare continue grow . place remain vigilant incredibly focused . perfect . turning supply chain . vendor within data center supply chain expecting cloud provider enter digestion phase back half year . curious quickly able provision increased capacity historic buying pattern server , networking data center equipment lumpy . guess data center eﬃciency gain impacted purchase well ? yeah , think 's fair say 2020 , 's lot thought around supply chain , technology cloud within every single industry . company looking supply chain resides , globally resilient respond different global event . microsoft supplier different . continue look 're sourcing component , meet business need withstand unpredictable event may occur , global pandemic . look , , course , continually innovating , term long lead activity , well ensuring appropriate buffer reserve respond event , wherever event occur world . , course , balancing eﬃciency customer responsiveness , continue tweak evaluate approach based learning . covid , fact number reserve allowed u rapidly scale continue optimize formula based experience . 've also learning supply chain continuing diversify globally remove single point dependence ensure diversity across ﬂeet . mean use different part silicon , 's continuing work across different supplier continuing build partnership across industry . definitely , look capacity , buying pattern work 're , 're , first foremost , focused ensuring customer continue grow move workload need move . 're hyper-focused continuing ensure diversity supplier . , course , thing need continue grow short , medium long-term across data center , server software . got . maybe press little bit . anything -- additional color provide term lead time ? tom keane taylor mcginnis tom keanewhen see pipeline 're going increase usage 're going see greater demand , really easy scale capacity ? purchase data center equipment , tend lumpier ? -- lead time actually fairly short , like big lumpy purchase ? , , guess , additional color provide term guy , think data center expansion lot capacity buildouts , relates spend lot data center ? yeah . start customer lens , obviously , customer expect u cloud computing provider elasticity , capacity need need . , first foremost , focus engineering team . second , course , quickly bring capacity live . customer , want seamless . work constantly focus refer doc live , long take bring server warehouse data center live taking customer load .
