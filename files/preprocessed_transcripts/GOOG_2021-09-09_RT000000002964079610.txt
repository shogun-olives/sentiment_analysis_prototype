much global market address current infrastructure footprint ? determines expand ? mean , continue expand market see demand market , different market , bringing technology closer closer going country . , 've expanded , example , india , melbourne . announcement earlier week germany , big expansion germany . 'll see u continue broaden regional footprint . said , even top , cloud becomes important technology infrastructure different country , new regulatory requirement coming , notion sovereign cloud ability require data located country . capability top cloud provide sovereign capability many- q - brad zelnick - thomas kurian q - brad zelnick - thomas kurian q - brad zelnickmany different part world 's also broadening addressable market 're meeting regulatory requirement . lastly , 've also introduced new product organization need super low latency say , well , look , love move everything cloud , application 's running example , mainframe , want analytic tool next mine . 've also introduced private cloud offering run inside corporate data center . , broadening regional footprint , moving private cloud hybrid cloud new offering addressing sovereign client , continuing expand total addressable market , providing new opportunity people work u use technology . make perfect sense , thomas . maybe finish , profitability . operating loss improved last couple quarter . reached inﬂection point profitability think steady state margin business ?
