excellent . well . good morning , everybody . welcome back . 'm brad zelnick , software analyst equity research crãƒâ©dit suisse . truly delighted joined rajesh jha microsoft . enterprise -- excuse , executive vp . see e get confused sometimes . executive vp microsoft's experience device group . format presentation fireside chat . think 've -- scope microsoft , 've got lot thing talk today . maybe introduction sake , maybe could start brief bit background . rajesh , 've microsoft since early day , since 1990. thanks dating , brad . okay . question answer 're welcome . think 's important recognize perspective time . , leading experience device includes oï¬ƒce , device , window client , new experience technology enterprise mobility management . mean thing touch every day . part life . give u sense journey year ? n't want say year . clearly seen lot microsoft time . q - brad alan zelnick - rajesh jhayes , sure . mean , 's privilege journey . came microsoft straight school worked 3 ceo , bill steve , recently , satya . experience mostly enterprise side , though , also worked consumer product . would say , formative year last 10 , perhaps even 15 , started vision productivity cloud . even though oï¬ƒce 365 journey , early member , started 10 year ago , bill really pushed u think productivity cloud . project called ( mad doc ) 15 , 16 year ago . interesting technology came . n't take market . 've cloud productivity really mean world cloud last 10 15 year . today , -- beyond oï¬ƒce 365 productivity collaboration , surface window client , management , security compliance . really thinking modern workplace customer . excellent background . maybe speak cloud tailwind . last 5 year , company undergone significant shift . 's proven significant tailwind microsoft whole . microsoft 's really embraced collaborative relationship competitor open source like , thing , n't know , decade plus ago may never imagined . talk group specifically evolved time ? mean connecting customer sale function , way engineering product team . . 's great question . mean , think cloud enabled u really rethink way build product . end user perspective , go back five year ago , application focused . used think mail calendar oï¬ƒce collaboration real-time communication . today , start strong sense user center . u live world surrounded device , surrounded application , working multiple platform . started user center . notion called microsoft graph encapsulates user ' goal , project , work , document work , device use . start core . build application , whether oï¬ƒce team video stream , make work cross-platform . finally , enterprise , think management , security , compliance identity knowledge management . 's vision , start user center . go . whereas past , really around application silo . people ask , help user , help matter application 're , matter device 're , q - brad alan zelnickunderstand context , intelligent behalf . 's definitely user-centricity . cloud also helped u much customer-centric pre-cloud world packaged software . used build stuff multiple year , hand customer . often , customer would , product mission-critical , would take multiple year deploy . feedback signal customer would often year year initially built product . get co-develop customer . build new security capability new knowledge management , project cortex talked last month , lock/unlock enterprise intellectual property connect people people project skill . co- developing customer . product team today take full accountability , build stuff , ground customer need . help customer successful deploying . run team called fast track team . 's part oï¬ƒce microsoft 365 team . engineer work customer . fund help customer get deploy . deployment n't enough . work counterpart sale -- help customer successfully deploy value customer success manager . entire life cycle , ideation , deployment , adoption feedback . 's meant changing sale , , sale force much outcome-driven , much business value le licensing . -- sale force increasingly starting think role-based productivity . 're starting think industry relevance . partnership front , customer going use multiple vendor , multiple solution . 've seen u work apple google build application platform . course , think 've seen recent announcement salesforce adobe cloud connect make sense . rich api microsoft graph allows isvs connect add value customer . yes , 's quite journey . mean , cloud really accelerated rate 're able deliver value see customer realize value business model , delivery model past age . quick follow-up term development process development team . would seem cloud factor served compress development life cycle today , thing much iterative - - much collaborative design iterative process . mean , different model maybe 5 10 year ago . - rajesh jha q - brad alan zelnick - rajesh jha q - brad alan zelnick - rajesh jha q - brad alan zelnick - rajesh jha completely agree . 's obviously end benefit customer . term run organization think engineering , change world way go ? 's great question , brad . mean , culturally , big transformation . innovation long lead cycle , end lot functional depth -- mean product management arm engineering arm consulting arm sale arm support arm 's discrete life cycle value delivery chain . 're faster pace , start compress . customer today cloud , n't care issue product issue support delivery issue misconfiguration deployment . buying service u . force u internally much cross-functional work work much tighter loop . whereas past , collaboration different function really core scenario , core scenario . engineer on-call . engineer talk customer far , far ever must . actually , perfectly honest , wo n't way . big shock beginning . think time make innovation cycle 10x faster , every process , every process organization , completely rethought . 've gone least 10x faster term innovation , , order magnitude . excellent . dive product ? yes , sure thing . yes , course . earlier year build conference , satya talked microsoft 365 world 's productivity cloud . hearing much microsoft 365 lately ? vision microsoft 365 really integrated service power modern workplace , power modern education , power small business , nonprofit . want bring vision consumer always . let talk little bit investment pillar microsoft 365 , maybe help concretize . first , course , delivery productivity collaboration service , whether oï¬ƒce newer service like microsoft team , microsoft stream . that's user work together generate together , collaborate together , communicate together . another investment pillar u take system engagement , oï¬ƒce team . help people automate business process , connect business process . take system record connect system engagement ? lot thrust automation business process connectivity microsoft team power apps . enterprise perspective , 's securing , complying regulation , managing real estate , managing data , identity . 's kind investment pillar u . end day , digital transformation picking speed . 's still early day , important database organization graph people , skill , work , project . connect people relevant business process ? get context colleague right skill ? connect relevant project ? knowledge management another core thrust u . microsoft 365. honest , 2 , three year ago , , licensing construct . allowed customer buy oï¬ƒce 365 , management security window 10 one construct instead 3 product . 1 licensing construct . , today , integrated product increasingly . 'm end user 'll launch edge browser search browser . -- search enterprise knowledge , search document , search internet , search well , natural language interface , work across data . today , security perspective , signal come endpoint , signal come iot , signal came application , identity integrated . longer 3 threat protection story , 1 microsoft 365 threat protection . 's integrated admin perspective , longer go administer different apps different workload . 's microsoft 365 , go admin microsoft.com . 's one way administer . microsoft 365 really integrated product service underlies dial tone modern work , communication collaboration automation , business process , connectivity , knowledge management , course , security management . q - brad alan zelnick - rajesh jhanow financially , course , would expect , customer buy vision microsoft 365 tend use service . tend higher revenue per user , churn le . offer customer integration , best-of- breed . also integrated well together . sound like tremendous value proposition customer . look trend term 's adopting microsoft 365 , would notice industry , vertical , customer size , ? shared u licensing construct go-to-market bundle today , much integrated , 's maybe tip spear , specific demographic , driving value prop catalyst adopt ? yes . today , know , oï¬ƒce 365 , lot customer enterprise oï¬ƒce 365. many customer take look service opportunity take management security window 10 commercial integration point . customer like goodyear , oï¬ƒce 365 customer . choosing microsoft 365 customer . 's one path see customer ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) microsoft 365. customer today using microsoft 365. one thing may talked enough microsoft 365 oï¬ƒce traditionally information worker , people like u . microsoft 365 , bringing productivity collaboration call first-line worker . 2 billion people planet often first touch patient , touch somebody retail ï¬‚oor manufacturing . work knowledge better knowledge shift process , communicate colleague . also see customer broadening coverage microsoft 365 beyond information worker . example , air france using first-line worker transportation industry . mark & spencer using microsoft 365 get retail employee connected information worker . 're connected use microsoft team , configurable app brings module together mean go . 's another path see . oï¬ƒce microsoft 365. see broadening coverage employee covered microsoft 365. still customer continue move healthy clip on-prem cloud directly microsoft 365 , older version oï¬ƒce window . q - brad alan zelnick - rajesh jhawe excited microsoft 365 beyond enterprise , smb value proposition give integrated security , integrated collaboration , productivity compelling . traditionally , oï¬ƒce , n't much share emerging market . excited microsoft 365 emerging market microsoft 365 great set application mobile device . economy mobile-first , mobile-only . get microsoft 365 extending well . talked innovation 's driving integrated solution already . note ask driving combined value proposition . one topic , mean , written ai microsoft graph ask . edge computing . maybe talk part overall design construct guy thinking edge relates overall proposition offering ? yes . sure . mean , first , let talk ai part . 'd like -- go back saying , user-centered . user-centered , longer application . able compute deliver ai , centered , calendar , task , project , document . different application manifest differently . example , word , 'm health care industry , spellcheck grammar check critique know vocabulary , know acronym , know project name organization based purpose graph . giving ai , contextual , job , industry , specific company . today , take look powerpoint , ability recommend many deck create much presentation create often -- original idea . want take idea relevant deck , want bring together . ai help , suggests , `` hi . -- see slide 're working . recommend document purpose access may relevant take slide . '' measure success ai based many idea gave user , many time choose keep idea . relentlessly get better better . microsoft team , example , meeting , automatic transcription translation . satya townhall , ai 's able split video bite-size chunk . somebody searching given topic , n't get hour-long video . get specific snippet relevant search term . talked security compliance . think , unique value proposition security compliance , one pillar , fact 6.5 trillion , 7 trillion signal coming every single day graph . ai actually really trying think threat protection signal . ai permeates q - brad alan zelnick - rajesh jha q - brad alan zelnick - rajesh jha q - brad alan zelnickin project cortex knowledge management applying ai signal . got . permeates everything . point , brad , edge , edge computing . think architected way , azure cloud m365 , run compute client necessary . model run client disconnect run service , make sense overlay enterprise model top personal model . oï¬ƒce , oï¬ƒce ability served cloud directly browser . also run native application , whether window pc mac io android device . 'll take compute right ever get . got . dig oï¬ƒce 365 commercial . point , 's material portion total oï¬ƒce commercial installed base , 65 % end fiscal '19 . seat growth still strong 21 % year-on-year , least recent quarter . think installed base o365 commercial going forward ? focus migrating still on-premise versus adding new seat balance 2 growth driver ? yes . n't think 's balance much . talked seat growth , seat growth continues come . feel growth opportunity term going beyond information worker existing customer . information worker , connecting first-line worker , connecting first-line worker information worker business process . driver future growth seat existing customer . small business , think opportunity reach share small business . lot room grow . talked emerging market ability productivity collaboration experience mobile device . see another growth opportunity . term customer still on-prem moving cloud . continue enterprise-grade security compliance feature . continue add . 've seen recently bank canada moved , recent example , couple capability looking available cloud . - rajesh jhagot . switch topic cybersecurity . recently , 've hearing much security microsoft . obviously , huge area opportunity large expanding market . fact , last earnings call , satya talked sentinel microsoft defender , threat protection 100,000 organization using azure ad premium . recall hearing microsoft spends $ 1 billion year security-related r & , , context , 2x significant security company , like palo alto network , amazing . microsoft think security today across competitive landscape ? yes . 's good question , brad . let start telling see customer context today . first , feel 's -- today , talking customer prior meeting . telling 150 security solution . 's atypical , many solution , n't make secure . 150 different application telling incident alert threat . mean 's going stitch together ? one important , really look ? fragmentation signal , fragmentation different lens n't make secure , even need continues grow . intellectual property creation , really 's happening digital transformation , whether code data , whether document , whether business process . need protected . 's fragmented protected today . -- think one statistic remember 80 % content exists organization today even classified . n't even know risk profile thing . 're early day transformation . thing see rate change incredibly fast right organization . still early day traditional perimeter disappearing , network perimeter . people bring device , 's iot proliferation . data generation , code generation organization continues grow . -- take look talent available customer . actually reason signal drive security , 's huge shortage people security incident management , kind analysis . vision security , would say , first , want make sure build best-of- breed . 're well-known category , whether endpoint management , whether ( stem ) , whether identity . want best-of-breed core category . also want deeply integrated go back fragmentation . 's enough best-of-breed . want best-of-breed integrated . second thing want build security close data , close application . want also extend fact heterogeneity customer's q - brad alan zelnick - rajesh jha q - brad alan zelnick - rajesh jhaenvironment . example , data leakage protection built core workï¬‚ows oï¬ƒce . allow connector bring non-oï¬ƒce data apply policy data leakage protection . thing threat protection . built-in . extensible . third thing , feel like , saying earlier , 6.5 trillion signal every single day identity , endpoint , application run cloud-scale ai . , connector , customer bring signal graph reason . finally , going solve , customer going multiple solution . something called intelligent security graph , allow customer plug signal , others isvs . 50 partner today enter security graph . taking holistic look security . would say , security one dimension . 's security , 's compliance . compliance , mean privacy , mean insider threat risk management . 80 % big breach tend insider risk , insider threat rather outside . classify data , protect , overlay right policy . security compliance . course , identity core plane enables thing . finally , management security integrate , . get signal security , security signal tell exposure across vast range device , enterprise , management plane able take signal remediate thing . expansive view . rajesh , half hour go pretty quickly interesting conversation . want sneak 1 2 quick topic minute left . yes . term team , team seen significant success deep integration oï¬ƒce product . 're larger daily active usage term compared main competitor , 's end game collaboration important ? maybe 10 year ago , atomic unit productivity , individual , could go . true anymore . atomic unit product right group . none u anything meaningful . context working others . microsoft team -- vision team like meta operating q - brad alan zelnick - rajesh jhasystem ( fish ) . 's something centered group application come group , right application come group . today , way compute -- whether phone tablet desktop , pick application , 're trying get job done collaborate within application . jump application application . team ' vision go group 're trying project , whether group -- org group , whether 's project group . right application come group . team , think shell brings chat , brings meeting brings telephony , brings oï¬ƒce , brings third-party application , brings business process . take look ui team , extend , like browser-over-the-tab metaphor , bring external application , right application right group . also carry mobile device . mobile device , today , configure module -- say , 'm first-line worker mark & spencer , perhaps application show team , shell -- team shell , chat , scheduling module , module take look task list . n't need see meeting module . team like shell brings productivity oriented group . vision team 's applicable information worker first-line worker . productivity . 's also connecting business process . committed making team powerful platform allows third-party application connect , 've connected oï¬ƒce team . helpful perspective little bit time left . financial analyst end day least . wanted ask question margin , oï¬ƒce 365 margin particular . 've heard talk o365 margin moving towards steady state moderating improvement business hit low-70s gross margin percentage . journey ? talk difference margin structure serve o365 versus typical born-in-the- cloud saas offering . first , 'll say o365 born-in-the-cloud saas offering . couple thought . first , take look scale o365 . think last quarter , amy satya talked u 200 million active user . take 200 million active user , service many user . find sliver , even service , 200 million , pick service 2 million user , margin profile going different margin profile something like mail document storage , 's real cost storage . o365 m365 broad set service across many user , 's -- n't think compare saas service couple million user aggregate usage pattern . q - brad alan zelnick - rajesh jha q - brad alan zelnick - rajesh jhawith , feel -- feel hard work engineering side , azure colleague continue drive cog increase margin . 's counter pressure . customer using workload . ai resource-intensive investment . ready make investment give value back customer . know , e5 , premium offering customer security compliance phone system , 're going continue add new value analytics knowledge management project cortex , increase arpu give u higher margin . 's lot thing play . workload different cog profile others . continue engineering work . ai consumption counter pressure . premium offering continue increase margin . make perfect sense . , think 're time . rajesh , thank immensely joining u year conference . pleasure . thank . 's great . yes . thank , brad . thanks .
