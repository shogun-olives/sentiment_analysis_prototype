're able help advertiser , placement creative , translates additional revenue , we're continuing leverage 're ai address side . mentioned talking green room , work done around google shopping . 's great example . 've done google shopping whole mission 've heard lot u talk -- lot heard u talk , open broadest array merchant 's good merchant , 's good user , 's good overall ecosystem . 's type work looking , come back context query 's useful . think google cloud gcp sort fitting ai opportunity well ? going incremental competitive advantage ? like , ai drive workload gcp ? well , core question , firmly believe ai transformative one u business . ability connect closely customer , ability extract operating eﬃciency business , ability address risk management requirement need . , google cloud team somewhere excited way able work customer across one , really leveraging infrastructure , go back ai question better deliver . ai infrastructure enables customer really leverage tpus , gpus really run need . bring data analytics 's critical ability , , dimension . 's cybersecurity capability . , yes , incremental everything 've already spoken . core , leveraging ai capability across google . 's gcp . similarly , within workspace , 've used ai collaborative doc tool gmail quite time look forward , continuing add llm work 've . okay . looking forward announcement . announcement , ai tool , come cost . 've lot work trying figure cost . think wall street generally -- estimate say - ruth m. porat q - analyst - ruth m. porat q - analyst - ruth m. poratincremental cost ai model 2x 3x expensive paid search . case , even higher 're going lot aggressive training large model . first , love reaction . secondly , case expensive paid search run model , think long-term margin profile alphabet , opex structure ? walk u little bit . 're absolutely right . llm -- running search alms llm generally compute intensive thus expensive . important point new google , 've asked question many , many year . cost compute continued increase , one , scale internet growth internet . two , 've already said , 've using ai decade . introduced llm four year ago . , new u . 've hopefully self-evident result number team focused every element eﬃciency around compute driving eﬃciency much possible . , specific , within infrastructure area , 've heard u talk tpus benefit tpus . team 's focused software optimization , move workload eﬃciently possible . 're looking overall model eﬃciency benefit well . obvious point llm n't need used every query . optimizing actually think application . , yes , premise right . yes , focused . 've got host team focused cost eﬃciency around compute 's important part think sort long-term performance , year . exactly . watched ai tool . 's new . 's new , 's decade . yeah , 's lot work . great . capex ? talked total 2023 capex ﬂat reported basis . think real estate capex probably going quite bit . , 're sort backing infrastructure capex , 20 % plus year . sort talk u driver capex year ? think capex capital intensity spend needed sort push ai consumer across product ? capex 2023 generally line 2022. 're right , real estate capex meaningfully . capex around technical q - analyst - ruth m. porat q - analyst - ruth m. poratinfrastructure meaningfully . 's data center server primarily support cloud everything 're ai , said general , come ballpark line last year . okay . fourth quarter call , talked eﬃciency expense sort discipline . said , 're focused delivering sustainable financial value , obviously mean expense growth growing ahead revenue growth . remember saying previously around topic . maybe walk u sort area focused drive durable expense discipline ? made progress ? expect see impact p & l ? well , 's important truism , seemed valuable reiterate . tried underscore call focused durably re-engineering cost base number workstreams ﬂight . include everything looking apply ai internally process , well eﬃciencies technical infrastructure asked , that's one bucket . second big bucket around vendor everything 're around procurement , eﬃcient element . third major bucket , call , work . , one workstreams launched . reason wanted stress durably change substance take time . , workstreams place . expect 'll contribute '24 beyond . view critical element 're continuing work deliver durable result look 's overall investment requirement . okay . helpful . let 's talk hardware . sundar spoken hardware one key long-term priority alphabet . hardware matter ? guess second one -- talked little bit pixel , hardware ecosystem potentially ai advancement ? -- sundar talk hardware , particular , focused pixel family , phone , tablet wearable . view 're able really highlight opportunity , future compute bringing together best ai hardware software . example , already gave example around magic eraser , also thing around translate . , view 're able highlight android ecosystem , benefit android ecosystem addition platform investment 're making . , 's context view important . tried clear call , 're investing meaningfully opportunity , q - analyst - ruth m. porat q - analyst - ruth m. porat q - analystthat 's said 's real focus drive incremental eﬃciency , whether 's work supply chain location opportunity team , 's overall , opportunity expense implication . okay . let 's shift youtube sort strategic priority . maybe level set everyone , sort one two key area investment prioritization youtube come user offering , advertiser offering , overall ecosystem ? well , 'm saying 're asking , next year , youtube short . overall , youtube extraordinary asset .
