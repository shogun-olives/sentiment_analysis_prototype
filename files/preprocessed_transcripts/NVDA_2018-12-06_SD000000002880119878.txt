thanks joining . 'm blayne curtis , u.s. semiconductor analyst . apologize ahead voice . 's kept active , ( inaudible ) raspy . told collette , run voice , 's going adlib rest . welcome first 2 lunch keynote , happy nvidia , colette kress , cfo . question answer thought maybe good way start , 're thinking broader audience may familiar nvidia . second day conference . 'm sure theme like ai , like autonomous driving , robot , gaming theme ( inaudible ) company . look , maybe good way start strategically , core ( play ) technology . 're sort increasingly even market ai . maybe talk strategy nvidia new market serving ai . okay . 've definitely changed company last 25 year . really focused company strategy accelerated computing company . ability take accelerated computing 4 key market driver , including gaming , pro visualization , data center including ai well autonomous vehicle . probably front center . known market growing double digit across every single one . tend highest market share market well also probably best technology . long work really taking gpu first overall killer app term gaming , essential term bringing high-end gaming market . q - blayne peter curtis - colette m. kressnow seen many extremely important use case go forward . overall area accelerated computing expanded tremendously last couple year 2 , important market change . first one ending overall moore 's law . moore 's law shown overall computing performance able grow 100x 10 year coming probably growth rate 2x period time . use therefore accelerated computing using overall gpus ability expand grow overall computing 1000x 10x period time . additionally , increased use ai use overall gpu perform , deep computational work also expanded , really expanded market . still believe tremendous overall market growth front u extending overall portfolio market . know maybe generally note segment , data center . business last three year gone -- 's $ 3 billion run rate . think -- last analyst day talked handling $ 50 billion , $ 30 billion , huge number . look $ 3 billion . obviously , lot go . put financial analyst hat see law large number growth . whether 200 % year-over-year 's 40 % 50 % . people trying figure curve . maybe perspective . mean , 2 part people may familiar . training learning inference side . first wave kind learning figuring want nvidia second part deploying inference ( inaudible ) . 's really interesting question think start right term data center business . think actual performance 've seen last year , 've even seen last couple year , 're still , term number server actually deployed world , le maybe low single digit term overall installed base . equally term look overall hyperscale . overall csps , term overall use capex , 're still extremely small overall percentage . 've reached run rate exceeds probably $ 3 billion year term work overall data center . believe 's continued expand overall workload address , expand type compute . recently , example , introduced overall t4 , heard right area overall machine learning , overall use term overall inferencing , continues overall expand workload . traditionally looked 3 different type market focused term data center . one , focused term work term supercomputing , high-performance computing , work term wisp , csps hyperscales . 2 expanded addition q - blayne peter curtis - colette m. kress q - blayne peter curtis - colette m. kressof overall t4 address overall enterprise market , enter expanding new market , machine learning data analytics well . ability outside supercomputing , csps hit overall enterprise , expand workload past deep learning , machine learning , supercomputing mostly term new workload . t4 essential term bringing consider scale overall infrastructure , second generation using overall tensor core . ability overall mass volume hyperscales enterprise using overall t4 . even 's -- t4 inference pas could plugged ( inaudible ) server . date , 've seen deployment inference done cpu , 's going deficient . 're still early day . 've begged -- everybody waiting , inﬂection point going happen ? ( inaudible ) make decision put extra processor server look next year , something think start ? absolutely . t4 important actually quite well already . know , google -- one first adopt put term google cloud platform . overall csps working quite fast actually move also incorporate t4 . establishing additional space within data center mass use overall t4 clearly term next direction 'll go . form factor absolutely solid overall software stack order deploy overall t4 throughout overall data center , throughout overall workload . believe hyperscales long term likely get almost every single one overall server data center accelerated . even part inference , 's data center edge application 'll play . 've leader auto . always supportive auto bus tour . thank . tuesday , saw head business . felt like message little different everyone focused level 4 , 5. 's taking longer kind deploy . wave , whatever want call , c-plus tesla-type autopilot actually may coming quicker . kind perspective shift mean nvidia ? yes , think 's important understand whether looking robotaxi , focused level 4 level 5 looking level 2. , clear amount compute necessary complete either one size level term autonomous vehicle . learned year supportive different oems tier 1 . q - blayne peter curtis - colette m. kress q - blayne peter curtis - colette m. kresswhat important architecture , delivery full solution end-to-end autonomous platform use term testing development today , referred xavier , well term overall drive software 's incorporated . essential term work need complete testing complete overall development work . whether level 4 , level 5 happens first , whether high-end level 2 , 2 stream absolutely happening . level 4 , level 5 much complex type problem . need overall redundancy able function matter car would driver , would overall steering wheel . work term level 2 high-end level 2 , first bring level -- high-end level 2 market . platform first win volvo term mainstream passenger car also front u . know competing term time frame . testing actual silicon today actually work absolutely instrumental sure market next couple year . maybe 's interesting see ( inaudible ) also full , particularly auto , entire full stack . ﬂeet autonomous car , team labeling . give perspective exactly range offering versus maybe wanted , oem , 're working tier 1 wanted go alone . bring table versus others ? yes . 's correct . full stack . ability provide many different configuration even overall compute standpoint . create compute platform soc gpu , could 2 socs , 2 gpus . depends term want overall configure inside type car 're . even additionally , end-to-end complete full stack take work holistically term overall software . many case , likely partnered , working jointly term want define autonomous vehicle level 2 robotaxis 'll working . think interesting meeting ( rob saunders ) headed auto , actually lot edge inference market . spend lot time talking whether 's trucking actually last-mile delivery . maybe give u -- think maybe 3 silo , auto , kind robotics , even health care talk . kind outline opportunity seeing new thing pop ? q - blayne peter curtis - colette m. kress q - blayne peter curtisyes . believe world autonomous machine , move forward , going material amount overall compute necessary essential term machine function term future . developed 2 different platform address market . 've talked xavier , overall autonomous vehicle . also jetson platform centering around robotics , centered around drone , centered term machine , whether medical device scanned work need . case , look overall ai required autonomous part open source platform versus xavier platform still functioning term algorithm overall cuda . market , know , tremendous amount device . continue see broaden arena overall market . , yes , addressing . putting developer hat term may actually impact model , use case , whether 's within warehouse 's automated forklift , get , make sense . use case , mean , saying , like , china , could get thing last mile , seems really futuristic . ( inaudible ) another one make total sense . 's better solution . think opportunity layering , next year story think 's little bit longer term ? think work happening realtime . even though may sound futuristic think last mile think truck driving across u.s. middle night , 's tremendous amount work happening , many key overall trucking industry think delivery . absence trucking , actually employed deliver much good cyberspace , large problem need address . overall safety concern also front center term want . 're going see lot work term development manage overall computing need happen . mean need practice significant amount data . mean 're addressing work data center term helping infrastructure able manage data , able mine overall data come solution therefore road next couple year . see today . maybe end consumer n't see today . development side , 're busily working . ( honestly ) , competitive landscape . may going back data center . 've ( semi ) long time n't seen much investment one particular area ( best story ) last month . think 's nearly 50 company seen significant funding attacking $ 50 billion opportunity . think 's also interesting , 've seen - colette m. kress q - blayne peter curtis - colette m. kressvertical customer , google first . amazon last week announcement solution . maybe think -- google great example . . also one largest customer . worked ? maybe , maybe 's multiple solution exist time ? yes . ability underlying architecture get overall mass scale ability spread throughout overall data center consistency across . ability overall data center product address almost every single type workload would available term data center consistent overall software platform . think amount cuda downloads , amount developer , writing platform well also writing additionally overall application may work , expanding rapid movement also seeing industry . think work last five year began term ai time workload working point expansion 've seen , starting additionally image detection advancement video encoding , advancement term natural language processing , ability even come recommendation engine , overall workload continue change . also get ability add workload collectively together one overall ai solution . going essential . simple one workload may last form factor long continuous change . overall platform software together allows u feed much market . change gear gaming side , launched ray tracing , one biggest advancement gaming history . look -- 're working inventory gaming . think maybe give u perspective -- mean , people may even know ray tracing . maybe quickly even . look generation , feeling sale ecosystem game ? think 's least one game support . think take time get software actually use functionality 've added . ﬂip side , 're working ( upfront ) amount older generation 're working . 's status ? let 's first start turing . extremely excited architecture launched term turing . turing brought ray tracing overall gaming well term overall pro visualization business . mean ray tracing ? overall ability graphic look real overall use light , overall use shadow . better overall lighting shadow , three-dimensional , realistic appearing . q - blayne peter curtis - colette m. kress q - blayne peter curtiswe talking bringing ray tracing pretty much thing done probably 10 year ago brought programmable shading overall gpu brought overall graphic world . ray tracing essentially something assimilated last 10 year realtime . realtime reﬂection light , use bouncing ray light within overall picture done realtime . probably something people n't feel would brought graphic 10 year term future . bringing right market incorporating many game many enterprise application exciting factor next generation gaming . bring together term turing . continues outperform existing game well . even overall pascal architecture 's 25 % , 30 % better term . 's even better term -- astronomically 10x better overall maxwell version well . tremendous amount gaming ability upgrade overall turing architecture take place existing game . also buy future new game come ray tracing . future , 'll probably space have have-not , game overall ray tracing , one look photorealistic , almost like film , one . get 2 thing , increased performance today also generation ray tracing come forward . term catalyst , 'm curious . launch product high end first trickle . highest volume skus probably high end . 're going eventually launch mid-range product 's 're clearing inventory . 'm trying understand , look next year , catalyst really get title get demand ray tracing ? function getting mid-range bigger volume ? 's little bit . work mid-range pascal overall inventory . price following end cryptocurrency high long period time . 've normalized . got great set overall promotion set overall holiday season even beyond . feel finite amount time u work overall inventory , correct , u continue path bringing great product market restarting think need term mid-range . combination extending new architecture , additional performance . also breathing overall ray tracing bring forth , . actually minute . area ray tracing 've done great deal , pro viz people also may know exactly . ( inaudible ) number , drill actually tam - colette m. kress q - blayne peter curtis - colette m. kresspro viz ? start talking rendering video like application enable realtime . 's probably light-feature application 're n't even know . -- wrap opportunity benefit financially ? think market pro visualization , refer overall enterprise graphic . 's tremendous amount work , whether regarding tv , commercial , film industry , term photoshopping , creating catalog , lot work actually rendered graphic special effect term . order develop overall special effect see many end use case refer rendering process . rasterizing together overall graphic built . overall ability , overall ray tracing , able take rtx part market n't addressed , essentially work term special effect take place 'll call overnight next day send rendering farm come back full frame fully completed editing . 've able insert process address 're seeing right 1.5 million overall server several billion dollar overall business 's generally overall cpu farm . transforming overall gpu massively improves work , massively improves time order create much overall special effect improve term overall quality . 's -- overall size business . thank . , 're time . voice lasted . appreciate joining u . thank . much .
