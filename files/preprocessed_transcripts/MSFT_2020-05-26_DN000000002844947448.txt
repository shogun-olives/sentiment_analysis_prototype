'm doug burger . long-time , formerly researcher computer architecture . professor university texas 10 year , running research group , built cpu processor , new type hardware architecture silicon . moved microsoft 2008 started research group computer architecture microsoft research . team built number new thing , one catapult fpga platform , form basis , measure smart networking accelerates application bing . 's -- actually large scale distributed system 've built , use chip . year three quarter ago , company asked move team azure really start new direction cloud grows hardware innovation full stack innovation become important , recently , take active role ai architecture system , 's really focus ai infrastructure , hardware low software level . , 's 've . great . good . david ? yeah , connected redmond . actually , 'm connecting probably short walking distance oﬃce , useless day . , could anywhere . yes , 'm redmond . joined microsoft almost 20 year ago background software development . , attracted time , microsoft famous window , right ? actually attracted microsoft developer tool , like dna microsoft . , held variety role connecting , engineering , sign business , always connected around developer business . , used lead business visual studio , visual studio online , azure tool . like five , six year ago , noticed something changing industry 's new software called ai . , made transition ai , , lead ai innovation team business side microsoft . good . doug burger brent bracelin doug burger david carmonai forgot -- brent , 'm sorry , forgot mention , 'm bellevue , probably couple mile away david . ( multiple speaker ) well . 's power team , right ? meeting virtually . , cool . 's tied kind current seat ai kind frame discussion . reﬂect back last year , would say kind landmark ai innovation occurred , either across silicon system new class ai model ? landmark thing investor kind pay attention last kind year ? david , go ahead . , let 's start technology . recapping build , let 's go last week , right . , last week , -- 'm unsure go detail today , one key thing ﬂew little bit radar . probably heard term ai supercomputer announced last week , change behind u . implication far beyond hardware . key thing saw ai supercomputer train massive model , massive , mean billion parameter order million parameter . cool , yeah , get better le accuracy , really meant key change certainly something top , 's changing way develop ai . , ai platform , something clear . , people , company develop ai model case-by-case basis . realized massive model multi-task , generic traditional , customized , vertical model specific scenario . , bring interesting motion market , company embracing massive model customizing model particular scenario trust , therefore , bringing like state-of-the-art ai company , 's certainly one thing would highlight top , , ensure provide , , let mention another thing also form last week think important , say concept autonomous system . doug burgerso chip , everybody also shooting autonomous assistance autonomous driving lot case , 're forgetting autonomous system much broader . last week , announced bill first preview , every developer access , autonomous system platform . go beyond motion control . target robotics , thing like process optimization , thing like machine calibration lot scenario much , current situation company address , that's another one like . doug , 'm sure add top lot . n't know , pretty -- great , complete , let 's see . couple thing might underscore -- particular , ai supercomputer announcement really david said size model growing much , much faster , think , u predicted . mean growing , round number 10x per year , growth rate far surpasses moore 's law , active also disrupted 50 year . giant model , 've seen far bigger train , break towards able train semi supervised , especially transformer natural language . year half ago , really turned field domain data-bound problem compute-bound problem , 're racing build supercomputer , train model reasonable amount time , day , week , month . , disruptive . look capability , thing able drive term language capability , like david said , multi-modal 're seeing think rapid infusion ai across product family . , obviously supercomputer expensive . infrastructure , train large model different people built past . , train , serve model giant . serving real time also challenging expensive . , think transition really n't think industry grasped yet appreciated fast going drive capability ai different infrastructure need 10x requirement . go architecture , sound like unique thing 're create ai supercomputer , want go back comment made around size model kind changing . bleeding edge 's kind 1 % used case ? think size model moving kind data bound compute bound scenario , prevalent maybe appreciate outside looking ? david carmona brent bracelin david carmona yeah , doug , 'll take . two used case think separate clearly , right . one , 1 % company great massive model , n't believe every company planet . interesting thing actually building model , 's model mentioning , generic , multi-model , multi-task . centrally train model , company deep expertise access compute capability , customizing model need . , give example , 's way we're actually microsoft . , transitioned broader broader ai approach , oﬃce creating model , dynamic creating model , bing creating model . culture centralized creation massive model team customize , feature oﬃce like auto reply like document summarization coming customizing model without requiring massive infrastructure expertise . , 's two angle would separate . david , think going silo centralized larger model . accelerating feature , like 's big benefit . time market new ai functionality advanced ai function ? would say 's several , right . -- first , let 's go one one . least , would mention three . first one super obvious skill , right . state-of-the- art model everybody access . n't -- example , level almost , would say , researcher 's phd creating model , ca n't reuse . 's one super important say lot democratization ai industry . second one data , model trained initially huge amount data central . case , 're trending index web right , huge amount data 're adding . , customizing model , n't need big amount data . example , case dynamic , custom train model within additional data coming case , thing like customer churn identification , custom train model delta , domain , right . , interesting . , third thing would say compute power , customization using technical transfer learning , n't need train doug burger david carmona doug burgermodel scratch , n't need huge amount infrastructure required train model initially . doug , forgetting thing take ? think captured well . would add one point . asked model size think largest model train billion talked little bit announcement . view front bad wave , 's -- would n't call research , 's really pushing envelope system algorithmic technique data management . , find model , capability . take one quick size , radically large six month ago model used , kind throughout infrastructure . 's -- n't really think bimodal distribution like 1 % thing everything else , whole space moving , fast 's new thing , biggest thing edge . , thing huge one year ago , kind empowering product . think fast happening think note , mean take year build custom hardware , silicon build system deploy , , need make major change hardware platform , 's year . yet , huge shift le two year old 're still pushing envelope rate growth . yeah . , 're kind whatever whatever get drive model , fortunately , made lot investment past benefiting . second comment would make , think microsoft strategy perspective , go onto something david mentioned . successful public cloud infrastructure benefit customer . also massive paas saas business really empowers enterprise customer consumer frankly within oﬃce team change , like david saying , really reach many people transform business , infrastructure change made get model wide group user see value , take infrastructure customer use . , two half , mean think 's satya talk intelligent cloud , 's enterprise software cloud , 's one thing benefit slosh back forth empower everyone . brent bracelin doug burger david carmona doug burger brent bracelin doug burgerand think 're really top company half strong position . fascinating seeing pace change space , 's hard outside looking really fully appreciate , get consumer technology , see advancement , right . see small change , software getting smarter , right . 's hard u quantify dramatic thing changing back end . let 's drill , harsh , kind weigh architecture ai supercomputer . 'm trying understand 've azure kind build kind infrastructure run model azure , , ai supercomputer 's different . maybe walk architecturally what's different ai supercomputer versus azure , need kind think need kind optimized versus kind building apis azure . , walk u architecture . david , mind take initial crack one ? , 're architect . first , think 's mistake view azure azure . yeah . okay . lot common infrastructure across side . think like want iaa customer , let 's say big enterprise iaa customer , need incredibly high reliability availability , want great stability , want predictable performance , want access many region , really planetary computer people build infrastructure computing utility stay . , , go ai side 're trading one large model , 're running single program job massive number -- massive collection machine 's okay note go , right , build resilience large deal distributing system lot harsh kumar doug burger david carmona doug burgerexperience , example , platform like bing , stay respond , n't matter one note drop , 're building distributed system need complete job cheaply fast possible , reliability characteristic component -- different . need , example , lot networking train giant model 're data intensive communication global . provision much aggressive cross data center networking need iaa customer . obviously , different mix hardware silicon component 're massive amount linear algebra . think look high speed networking , ability communicate quickly , power requirement need drive , raw performance . thing accrue core azure business well . 's extreme point business follow along . benefit technological advancement 're making . sorry , two question . earlier , want go back five minute ago , think mentioned maybe david mentioned transfer learning . effectively , would train large data set would give enterprise data center run . talking something even smaller like running small chip edge still talking kind data center type process ? david , n't take one ? yeah , . end , massive model , course , , thought run cloud , time , see many scenario optimization , inﬂuencing model done edge . go side side . , yeah , absolutely . doug , anything add top . technically ? yeah , think way view transfer learning building base , model super expensive 's ﬂavoring specific data . like analogy , might -- everyone call speaking english , slightly different vocabulary nuance choice word , hence provide training english could ﬂavor history individual customize model individual speech pattern . harsh kumar david carmona doug burgerand 's lot , david said earlier , 's lot cheaper ﬂavoring build whole english model scratch . 's training thing there's question , deploy cloud edge , think 's separate question . 's absolutely incredible . second question preferred sort computational mode . microsoft fan fpgas versus gpus simply care ? common knowledge asic cheaper , get set sort -- get parameter little bit want accomplish , always want reduce cost computing asic , curious ﬂavor guy prefer , doug david ? one doug . imagine , get asked lot 'm going say microsoft belief technology . let give framing think help people understand space . okay . think 're ai training supercomputer , 're massive amount effectively linear algebra . need outstanding system architecture low agency communication , need robust software stack , need resilience system level , like said . get silicon , 've got number trade-off , 've got sort eﬃciency silicon , like fast x raw ﬂops , 've got future-proofing , model shift , well silicon map shift . 've got innovation might hardware helped model training might help converge , like save cost . , 've got x set trade-off actually invested multiple technology . disclosed actually bigger built part really , really great training large model . , second thing would say really n't like term asic 's -- space , 's kind gotten overused , meaning mean customer chip , right . past , meant something different , right . building chip circuit one purpose thing really programmable engine linear algebra ﬂexibly . gpus fpgas , 've talked engagement graft core , ton start-ups across cloud edge , intel , programmable engine ai-based linear algebra . different set trade-off eﬃciency math unit front end feed -- 's new , like cpu many , many year , kind new class programmable harsh kumar doug burger brent bracelin david carmonaarchitecture 's emerging rapidly evolving space . -- end day , gpus fpgas called asics , 're chip lot math unit , architecture could even . thank . ultimately look like , n't think know least n't talk side company . 'll go back . 'll kind try get different angle that's big question . question , think industry pace change 10x , 're thinking technology change around moore 's law every 18 month , doubling transistor , think 10x every year , limited number company keep pace change ? nervous investor around thing moving fast 's really going limited number company manage pace change ? thought , david , think card rail kind need industry eﬃcient card rail ? yeah . feel counter intuitive , actually technology like instead limiting access ai fewer company , opposite . 's opposite company . let elaborate . n't expect , think mentioned company building massive model scratch time , expect concept ai platform . like past internet , , course , mobile , , cloud . equivalent ai . look company developing ai today , , mean , console platform , 'm sorry , doug , going hurt , leave , sense close something specific solution , top platform something customized solution , scenario . want go place ai good accessible like platform , use ai model customize model particular scenario . 's big change 've seen -- see coming soon , right . applies also , know , 're talking lot nlp , natural language processing , apply every scenario . coming back previous thing autonomous system , , similar pattern see autonomous system . would say creating autonomous system limited company . well , look brent bracelin david carmona brent bracelin david carmonathe angle building component scratch like deeper reinforcement learning , super complex technique available every enterprise address . approach different , provide platform abstracting top technique like reinforcement learning . company address , embrace autonomous system using expertise expertise , business , right . comparison applies many different facet ai pursuing across company . got . sound like 're still 're moving silo centralized model available different internal department microsoft , going start expose model externally kind azure service basis . , almost create new -- past layer ai essentially , really ... exactly , exactly . timing around ? something 's going like 2021 , 2022 kind opportunity 're going ( multiple speaker ) go back [ ph ] tax ( \ph ) position . like getting finish line . going -- 'll see value delivered journey right . beginning last week . already ton value company got used today . dual approach company , would say , three thing . look technology , would position three different state . first thing open innovation . , example , open source fragment , right . , example , last week , open source key framework -- key distributor framework engine called deep speed enable training , right . , that's something cool , right . 're going phase infuse model growth already , lot feature part product customer get access today used manner . , third stage would highlight also incorporate azure developer also build top right . also thing like azure connected service , ai model served service , right . easy use developer . three thing , cover entire spectrum . 's , hey , today , releasing everything , right . , 's move , make progress journey . thing getting infused three main channel . brent bracelin doug burger brent bracelin doug burger brent bracelin doug burger fascinating . last question shift gear kind ( multiple speaker ) brent , 'm sorry . could add point onto ? yeah . think 's important investor . imagine today -- started new company want become public cloud vendor , want build another cloud business infrastructure compete big mega cloud . capital need raise , deploy , -- build giant data center available around world many , many region number software feature need provision number saas paas service need board , 's achievable new entrant space , especially look advantage big player referred enterprise software business well . ai space , go directly question . need able build giant , biggest supercomputer world built train model . need really deep distributed system expertise , need really , really strong ai team understands , , capital well level expertise depth also , think , quite point would struggle try start public cloud , 's large growing . definition , 's going limit number player . able microsoft position want empower customer , like david said , give access technology , number people , number organization build infrastructure ground , think , going small . ( inaudible ) kind lead next question around openai . maybe could walk , opening relationship , put , obviously , bunch money , lot really great talented engineer , kind everything openai , maybe walk microsoft openai relationship , , relate ai supercomputer announcement ? brent bracelin david carmona doug burger brent bracelini say one -- 'll say two thing , think david weigh . want judicious commenting close partner . number one , openai among ambitious organization term 're trying ai mission . , , like internal team , push infrastructure hard . okay . think , given scope ambition , fact chose enter microsoft partnership , think 's , strong vote confidence infrastructure roadmap . think look say , wow , one ambitious ai organization planet willing sign deal commit infrastructure , tell something roadmap , n't publicize . helpful . anything else , david , want weigh ? yeah , think coming back doug 's point , right , sense order serve massive model , need deal throw number . , ai supercomputer one-off last week ago actually , became immediately number five supercomputer world . right . 's sign scale need . deal system like company time look formula one , right . , innovation formula one , make available typical card use every day . thing 're investment . 's creating ai supercomputer build massive model believe foundation ai platform mentioning , available vendor , really capital , , thing thinking innovation infusing azure everyday azure , right . , 's big aspect consider . 's right . underscore point , brent , 'm sorry , 'll sign minute , think david said , largest supercomputer world model growing 10x per year , think implication minute likely . version 1 fifth largest super computer world . 're trying keep modeling kind appetite 's growing 10x year , , , fascinating . harsh , question ? harsh kumar brent bracelin david carmona doug burger david carmona , outweighed actually . question quantum computing , 'll wait finish . let 's shift gear kind enterprise reality . enterprise reality we're going pandemic . work home , feel like environment could see thing ai product start pause slow , seeing kind post pandemic environment relative kind ai , appetite ai , slowing , accelerating , walk u seeing ? want take one , doug ? go ahead . ( multiple speaker ) yeah , please top . yeah . something , say even pandemic , seeing change conversation enterprise . remember , maybe four , five year ago , every conversation customer , hey , ai fee , top , right . , next thing finally company realize , okay , big , need embrace ai want transfer business , next thing get started . saw lot adoption enterprise , first phase adoption , right , many pilot , many proof concept , et cetera . time , 've seeing shifting market really funding back business , move beyond proof concept , connect ai business outcome . conversation really happening , pandemic , global crisis , done conversation accelerating even . , 've seen customer cutting chase , telling u , hey , need putting ai action need . usually conversation two front , right . one current crisis ( technical diﬃculty ) ai tool let deal disruption , buying experiencing today , even longer term , know we're never going back previous normal . 's going new situation lot economic uncertainty lot care optimize revenue , optimize operation , et cetera company . ai help . first one , let maybe , think question first one , right . today company ai ai helping doug burgerdisruption experiencing see three primary scenario . , three used case actually saw race demand customer , see across industry , particular vertical . first one , obvious course customer service , visible one , right . , company , many case , piloting using ai streamline customer service , accelerating project like , see example company working 18 month project current crisis , put production two day , right . acceleration see case , go many case , definitely customer support , like perfect storm request customer . time , operation impacted crisis , case , 're seeing broader scenario like really able identify best customer , proactive , personalizing service customer . see across number customer 'm happy later time go example company , 's one scenario . one see hugely happening crisis course business process optimization . 'd like separate , see , first thing customer noticing process established past , disrupted dramatically . , think supply chain , right , think forecasting demand . , fraud detection , customer churn , process dramatically different right . need put place process agile , ﬂexible change , ai solution helping area . 's one thing . thing course specifically economic situation , see customer looking cost saving right , business process , mean lot see many customer using ai shorten business process , streamline business process make productive . 's second scenario . third one see lot another perfect storm , right , employee productivity . think 's , course , ( technical diﬃculty ) go beyond . see another perfect storm , , complex situation employee deal business point view , impacted productivity current situation . see company looking ai short term increase employee productivity see many , many example . three . doug , n't know want add something top , go deeper example , want , later . yeah , thought super interesting . even interesting mean company , thank , david . would underscore david said . 're seeing crisis accelerating company 's desire digital transformation partially need partially 're going brent bracelin doug burger david carmona harsh kumar brent bracelin harsh kumarto optimize process deferred long time , might well , right . -- satya invested enormously microsoft bd trying company help people solve problem digital transformation . , think 's opportunity infrastructure service really help customer . think type kind ai used case seem kind resonating right , give three example . kind nlp ? text- speech , computer vision , ? one type ai 's really like , oh god , 's taken much faster would thought . david , go ahead . think , pick favorite right , 's nlp . , nlp right hot moment acceleration especially relevant area tricky nlp . , nlp complex , requires generalization . , complex solve , new state model , see huge potential . example said , nlp , see technique ai across board . david , vouch 's nine month since spoken live person without speaking machine first . think experience . absolutely . ca n't -- 15 minute left , think 'd helpful maybe get update project brainwave . obviously , doug , think last time met , kind three year ago get kind deep dive , love understand , maybe harsh probably better go , 'll turn harsh get maybe update project brainwave . sure , sure . n't -- david doug , n't give u 30-second one- minute overview 're trying accomplish project brainwave . , jump question . doug burger david carmona doug burger harsh kumar doug burger david carmona doug burgerdavid , want take ? doug , 's . okay . , project continuing , 's continuing go super well , 're using , continue use scale worldwide serve model trend . like said , definitely mix technology infrastructure , program particular , 're able -- incorporate innovation fairly rapidly really push model serving inference side capable . think really focused internal business 's need pressing think need serve giant model , latency cost , expense , 's lot innovation required . want talk much , going seeing publicly year . would chance get updated . one term hear lot obviously see hollywood movie stuff like well quantum computing . curious since guy top leading expert country ai , wondering , quantum computing even applied ai manner , useful completely different thing ? , guy feel potential maybe commercializing next five , 10 , many every year 's long ? would -- david , mind start ? yeah . take . , certainly overlap two research community looking machine learning quantum algorithm quantum-capable algorithm . would say right , personal view , 'm speaking company , initially two technology , ai supercomputer quantum harsh kumar doug burger harsh kumar doug burger harsh kumar doug burger harsh kumar brent bracelinsystems , targeting different application , thing solve lot quantum algorithm different problem 're large-scale ai model . eventually , may convergence , quantum , think , best initially problem huge compute requirement , lot state , simply diﬃculty keeping larger massive state superimposed domain . look amount state 're driving train model , 's massive . , think disruptive technology initially attacking different class problem . theoretically , possible overlap longer term . doug , say state , exactly mean ? 'm familiar . information , bit . okay . got . many bit state hold one computer . 1,000 , 10,000 ? petabyte data 're operating azure computer space . sound like 're far away , 's best way think quantum computing least couple year away , . n't want take position quantum roadmap . would say large- scale ai , think 're pretty far away quantum space . brent , anything ? yeah , let 's shift gear little bit maybe talk kind real world used case . 've covered lot ground , gave u scenario , people using , recently announced nda , announced sort kind new used case , think , build last week two week coming build around new large enterprise , ai microsoft ai , azure ai . think doug burger david carmonathere 's like 20,000 enterprise deployed azure ai point last year . walk people actually using , interesting scenario come across 'd like highlight u take technology real world scenario ? question david . yeah . take one , doug . would use frame using , would add one component . frame using three-key scenario . like go like canonical example even bring real customer three scenario , would add additional one , post covid-19 moment , right . 's moment see company reimagining completely new normal experience bring example thing area well . let 's start today . let 's start customer using ai today three scenario . started customer service . customer service easy one 's weird find customer using ai customer service , general , customer engagement , right . , many example . think exciting one announced last week actually healthcare area . , microsoft , know , provide platform customer create , example , bot user customer service , also provide saas solution use directly solution scenario . , one particular called azure healthcare bot service , vertical bot health organization use today customer service , case , patient service . , seen last month exponential usage service . give sense , seen 1500 health organization public health organization health provider , et cetera , implementing new project . think , 1500 new project put production , specifically covid-19 management . bot deployed week , reach 30 million people . think scale , right , -- provided huge tool really unload , reduce load seeing health professional like doctor nurse first level interaction patient . self- assessment tool patient take order redirected right resource , right . would one example bring . business process optimization , seen -- n't know start , , every company lot area . one , think mentioned one , one one announced last week fedex . like fedex perfect example business process optimization . massive amount data , granular data shipment fedex . , agreement , going ai top , better intelligence going . identify trend happening product happening , also optimize supply chain right organization . really , really perfect example business process optimization . could see everywhere , think indialends another customer . indialends underwriting credit platform india like 50 bank india case using ai credit approval system able decrease time -- processing time -- internal processing time credit approval 50 % , time imagine impact ability process twice number credit , right , -- moment like , absolutely critical . manufacturing , seen also many example . think mentioned one , see company starting use autonomous system , moonshot autonomous driving , thing like motion control process optimization manufacturing getting big result day zero , right . see many customer front . going bring . well , tell business process optimization . actually , saw also healthcare limited resourcing , right . critical thing like medical supply , even hospital bed optimized thing like ai . , typical . one mentioned employee productivity . let bring couple example . one generic , see lot ai working human outman productivity . , give example , reuters . case reuters , -- , journalist , writing article . case , using ai supporting , attach relevant video article . , go manual process finding relevant video , also -- using ai , also increase average completion rate 80 % technique , right . , better employee productivity , better result . one would mention connected think employee productivity removing like tedious task repetitive task . 's also making better decision . example bring team rubicon . managing 100,000 volunteer u covid-19 . think massive scale solution required . mean case , using ai really identify optimize deployment volunteer across u . , important work really making better decision . , example first part , company using ai response rate . let use couple example imagine phase , right . think big conversation , going health crisis turn economic crisis , right . , see three key thing happening . let use example . brent bracelin david carmonathe first one talk lot today ai scale . know talk lot ai scale concept model . bigger motion happen enterprise , really applying ai scale business . , moving pilot phase re-infuse everything . , key thing , bring example right , need scale usage ai across business unit moving beyond technical unit . see business connected ai transformation . something happen certainly move phase . example , would bring course key thing . think key lesson gone software development . remember conversation 10 year ago software . knew . called devops , bringing developer technical unit business together combined life cycle . n't ai . technical unit working silo pilot , infused business . equivalent devops ai called mlops see huge trend moving forward . example , bring published department transit vancouver . case -- think case , talk lot size model , number model need transform industry , transfer company . case company , 18,000 model . think number model , think managing model . way silo technical unit , right . brought together business technical unit common mlops process across . one . know 'm talking lot , let go two , think 's important . second one regarding ... 've got one minute drill 've conclude . one minute , 'll half-a-minute . second one want mention next step transformation empower business . talked lot technical unit developing ai , next step made big step microsoft empower business . also apply ai , right , thing like power platform , dynamic 365. see reality moving forward , , one example bring novartis . novartis , pharmaceutical know , -- like year ago , signed agreement basically empowering 50,000 employee . , almost half employee ai , n't think using ai , applying ai ﬂexibility freedom process . researcher researching new drug new treatment new vaccine augmented ai using process drug brent bracelin david carmona doug burger david carmona brent bracelin doug burgermanufacturers cellular matter expert . 's huge motion see moving forward . third one , would last one , let 's forget responsible ai . see responsible ai , conversation many year really seeing also huge shift conversation front , hey , challenge ai , principle microsoft , ai huge risk accelerate adoption ai , help implement ai responsible , mitigate risk . many example , read one , td bank , bank u canada . see 're using responsible ai mitigate thing like bias thing like adding transparency model deploying . thank , david . -- guy much talk ai . jonathan's extended conversation another hour , 'm kidding . last question , doug , think pace change , tax last year modeling side , excited , thinking ai industry microsoft opportunity next three year ? one thing , 's one thing excited ? thinking , doug ? david , need give thought . keep going back concept really putting ai action . concept democratizing ai , know 's technical , 's lot going empower motion 're , go beyond infrastructure software , 's really comprehensive solution research three cloud , tool , right . , really , really powerful get next year . driving business outcome sure . yes . yeah . 'm going give little bit squishy answer , 's true answer . rarely get opportunity , personal view , work thing david carmona brent bracelin david carmona doug burger brent bracelin david carmona brent bracelinreally change world positive way . think capability , 're going able generate , perspective hardware system work , know help really solve global problem . mean 's like lifetime opportunity build something allows u really make meaningful shift personalized medicine , climate change , eﬃciency , security , turning back concept responsibility . , really feel driven mission purpose really move needle make world better place , 's really -- 's blessing . great , doug . -- nice , said beginning , adjust answer . well , listen , 're time . really appreciate , david doug , sharing view current state ai . always , 's pleasure , thank much sharing thought . thank . thanks . 's good opportunity chat . great job . tag team often . pleasure , always . bye . take care , . bye-bye .
