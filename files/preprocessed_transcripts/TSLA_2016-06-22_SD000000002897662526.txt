thank , teria . good morning everyone . welcome tesla 's call discus rationale offer acquire solarcity . todd maroni joined today elon musk , tesla chairman ceo ; todd maron , tesla general counsel ; jb straubel , cto ; cfo jason wheeler . yesterday announced offer acquire solarcity filing sec blog post available www.tesla.com . call morning discus -- business outlook make forward-looking statement . based prediction expectation today . actual event result could differ materially due risk -- number risk uncertainty including mentioned recent form 10-q filed sec . 're going start today 's call comment todd elon followed q & . go ahead press star one get queue ask question . pas , todd . good morning , everyone . thanks , jeff . wanted brieﬂy touch process point yesterday 's announcement might looked somewhat different people normally see kind announcement . 's actually somewhat easy explanation somewhat unique situation . usually know everyone used seeing announcement 's actually definitive agreement 's reached simply offer . obviously situation announcing offer . , result , n't receive kind information would receive agreement reached agreement detailed financial information combined company . reason elon 5 % stockholder solarcity 's required security law keep market informed schedule 13d filing plan respect holding . tesla 's decision make offer solarcity elon 's support decision appropriate amend schedule 13d update market , even though definitive agreement yet reached . 's obviously hope engage due diligence process solarcity ultimately reach agreement . information would customarily see time , including agreement detailed financial information combined company , would provided . result actually transparent process 're essentially seeing behind curtain would ordinarily see transaction actually getting additional information upfront offer stage getting advance look strategic business rationale deal . actually pas elon speak strategic rationale deal think combining two company make sense . elon musk sure , touch yesterday think call mostly going getting maybe detailed question people . said yesterday kind three part -- said actually powerwall presentation last year . 's quite way think really quite obviously correct move order solve sustainable energy question need sustainable energy production , going come primarily form solar , overwhelmingly form solar energy . combine stationary storage electric vehicle complete solution sustainable energy future . three part needed . three thing think tesla providing . became increasingly obvious developing powerwall new version powerwall , particularly integrate inverter electronics intelligence powerwall really need take solar panel solar system account 're . otherwise duplicate lot hardware , n't work together well , 's expensive . installation cost substantially higher . 've got put solar powerwall , solar panel , 've got electric car 've got install wall connector home charging system . potentially three visit least two visit . term sale process 're selling somebody powerwall often almost always curious solar want thing . able sell solar directly solarcity , sorry , tesla store pretty ineﬃcient . look ahead say model 3 , $ 35,000 car , well , person moment could sell roughly equivalent amount value solar panel powerwall , effectively doubling almost doubling sale time . putting time . think word synergy like almost sort dirty word . think synergy really common sense . like , obviously , 's eﬃcient integrated system sale installation term general maintenance managing customer relationship . yes , think make kind pretty obvious thing . 's quite diﬃcult create integrated product 're forced arm's-length two different company . give special deal solarcity solarcity part tesla , ? solarcity part tesla . ca n't solarcity separate company . make thing , execution , think , lot easier cleaner effective . 's said yesterday think 's really kind no-brainer . like , n't would make tesla 's execution harder worse . think tide history strongly support -- sustainable energy future , primarily solar virtually entirely electric vehicle maybe thing temporarily interrupt tide history long term overwhelm everything . goal accelerate advent future fast possible help u accelerate . 's reasoning yes . yes think question like really increase debt position lever bank -- balance sheet . really n't , think ( inaudible ) take closer look solarcity . really matter recourse debt . obviously , nonrecourse debt matter . cash ﬂow generating solarcity generate -- cover 's required recourse debt . headed cash ﬂow positive situation next three six month outside . 's company steering , reducing growth rate degree achieve cash ﬂow positive position . clearly way getting short order . actually expect net cash generator , user cash , particularly taking account dramatic reduction cost sale solar system sold store . store . biggest factor solarcity's increasing cost per watt q1 sale cost . soon -- quite big increase sale cost -- go radically direction sale tesla . 'd love talk 's going happen power side . obviously , would , think , would shed lot light deal think make total sense really no-brainer . ca n't talk material , nonpublic plan except say 'm optimistic plan , date , solarcity significantly differentiated product side , tesla solar panel , certainly fairly near future . actually , listen carefully solarcity saying earnings call announcement learning also pretty clear like tesla saying 's going significant product differentiation . 's silevo acquisition think best technology high- eﬃciency , low-cost solar panel time significantly improving aesthetic solar panel . think quite radical difference solar panel roof actually make house look better versus one . think 's going night day difference . silevo development allows . ca n't go detail making kind future product announcement really exciting obviously affect future product sale 's -- full extent yet public jeff evanson operator q - brian johnson - todd maron q - brian johnsoninformation . believe fit together well tesla 's plan powerwall powerpack side . yes . turn question point . right . thanks elon . teria , n't go first question , please ? question answer brian johnson , barclays . yes . thank . three question . one elon , well , n't start general counsel jason . todd , know talked letter two director voting . give u sense , come proxy eventually , discussion two company ? actually committee independent director ? independent consider remaining director ? personal ownership solarcity thing likely relate board issue ? todd . , little bit track back saying earlier stage process 're . deal announced happens stuff come term exactly process every point . key point elon antonio since board recused board process voting transaction . 've also committed 's deal disinterested shareholder would vote deal majority disinterested share determining outcome vote . beyond 's really early process get different detail rest assured come actually definitive agreement 's reached . point , 's probably appropriate focus business rationale deal make sense . say recused voting also mean recused discussion present room brought ? - todd maron q - brian johnson - jason wheeler q - brian johnson - elon musk q - brian johnson . recused voting . okay . jason , given talk earlier year kind focusing cash even stipulating perhaps solarcity could reach sort cash breakeven fourth quarter , change view pro forma company term cash usage need potentially go back capital market , either debt equity , finance ongoing business ? yes , sure . tesla side 'd stick statement made previous earnings call . solarcity side , todd laid , 're beginning process . information 've access 's publicly available . anything say pro forma combined entity point . start look get full due diligence . guess due diligence question probably scoped deal . survey tesla owner , % solar already , % state solar would make sense sort basic merger synergy term customer overlap customer potential guy looked ? well think way think kind look rearview mirror look windshield . like 1 % u home solar . massive addressable market 's unserved . 's least 40 million 60 million household solar -- could solar wanted . economics right like aesthetic easy , would . future market really gigantic . cash front n't expect solarcity material impact future cash need . n't think 's going make much difference really . see positive cash ﬂow really end year . final , talked little bit yesterday . affect -- make sure personal time , course , rocket business given & synergy 're trying get given service overlap , that's - elon musk q - brian johnson operator q - brian johnson - jeff evansonkind whole separate line process kind grunt work ground launching new model car . actually get integration sale service system solar car battery done time 've got , admission , aggressive launch schedule model 3 ? well mean intuition could wrong . standpoint make tesla 's future execution easier , harder . 's getting increasingly unwieldy work solarcity arm's-length basis . really need integrated product . powerwall powerpack need designed together solar system . 's one-piece thing . really ca n't 're two separate company . 've got treat solarcity like 're company , extremely unwieldy . standpoint make execution easier , harder . think solarcity got great future independent tesla . obviously tesla . able integrate thing product level , consumer experience level , utility level , commercial level actually make easier , harder . 's 're . company exist , 's point company ? point given company going create compelling , greater service end customer . company two separate container one container ? one container make compelling product work together easier . 's reason . think speaks fundamental economic goodness transaction . would harder remain two different company . okay . thank . charlie anderson , dougherty & company . okay . next question come line brian johnson barclays . well already asked question . yes , teria n't go next caller please . let 's try charlie . operator q - charlie anderson - elon musk q - charlie anderson - elon muskcharlie anderson , dougherty & company . good morning . thanks taking question . wondered shareholder tesla synergy number mind vote guy early look synergy could . expecting much way cost thinking incremental cost combining product . ? sound like work already done combine product . thought would helpful . sure . mean give estimate obviously still early stage . mean estimate based kind stand reason . looking ahead , particularly next year selling model 3 think kind something order $ 35,000 car , 're selling powerwalls solar system comparable value sale footprint person first-order approximation cost sale drop half would solarcity's correspondingly . maybe 's entirely half , maybe 's 30 % 40 % . 's pretty -- think substantial drop solarcity side also drop , material drop tesla 's side . 're basically selling , let 's say , almost twice much single transaction otherwise would . installation setup side 's one crew instead one visit instead two three visit . ongoing maintenance kind one point contact sort two three point contact . cost system lower 're duplicating hardware , hardware level . think make lot sense . yes . final cost company would go materially . yes , -- think 's -- one could argue like sort 20 % reduction , 30 % reduction , 40 % reduction 's pretty significant sure better company separate . great . another quick one . wondered versus two year ago versus two year ? reason 've got -- really ramping powerwall powerpack 're developing version 2 kind plan q - charlie anderson operator q - sachin shah - elon muskversion 3 , version 4 forth . solarcity also preparing come solar panel consequence silevo transaction couple year ago significantly improved eﬃciency aesthetic roof . think aesthetic matter lot . know , tesla 're super sensitive aesthetic . think solarcity -- think going get think journey accelerated part tesla , well . sort make sense solar system made house look better , lowered cost electricity gave security power outage powerpack allowed go potentially completely grid 's kind no-brainer , like would n't ? thanks much . sachin shah , albert fried . hi . good morning . congratulation offer . couple question think people kind trying digest . think strategically elon 've made point clear think valuation market issue . question solarcity's balance sheet mentioned debt . put context change ratio offered kind jeopardizing future tesla make offer ? well think tesla getting pretty good current share price . mean tesla decide company 's share price mortgage probably market . 're , obviously , keying public market price , decided people . 's , think , quite reasonable neither high low acquisition premium put forward subject diligence . think 's -- every element reasonable . like 's nothing 's whack proposal , 's sort extremely normal acquisition premium size . certainly quite bit lower , example , say linkedin , ( inaudible ) premium , 're talking sort lower 20 % maybe 30 % premium . 's le line average acquisition premium given public market company . 's like extremely normal . q - sachin shah - elon musk q - sachin shah - elon muskthen overall , think people , 're road , even far road next year . particularly go future number going seem like small number . think combined automotive power storage power generation company potential tesla $ 1 trillion company , market cap company . play major role transitioning world new form energy generation storage transport 's kind happens . 's think one n't going worried whether 's hundred million dollar one way road . 's going make difference . okay . appreciate candor $ 1 trillion market cap . think lead future value solarcity guess near-term 're voting share tesla solarcity understanding -- 's correct . would expect near-term kind shareholder near-term focus shareholder vote -- vote favor ? 'm assuming 's simple majority . 's kind chicken egg thing future , expectation future probably correct strategically near-term people time digest , enough time digest kind looking near- term 's concern getting finish line . see getting finish line see shareholder solarcity side receptive exchange ratio , reach merger agreement along tesla shareholder receptive voting favor ? ultimately 's two three duck valuation exchange ratio understanding future opportunity get finish line shareholder side , shareholder vote ? yes . exchange ratio , obviously balance exchange ratio exceed bound reasonableness party obviously happen . except obviously market cap solarcity decided market . 's , investor think . premium , n't get acquire company zero premium . 's work . reasonable premium , obviously , appropriate situation like , always . q - sachin shah - elon musk q - sachin shah - elon muskand 're kind right premium normally actually lower recent prominent premium paid , like linkedin one believe order 50 % . think 's reasonable market cap reasonable premium . one maybe quibble around edge little bit . n't think there's anything like whack . end day definitely guy share like said , recuse shareholder vote . majority non-me shareholder . like said 'm think make thing better future , worse , everyone . far 'd really recommend voting favor think anyone n't vote favor going voting best interest . certainly abide shareholder vote . great deal unhappiness want move forward . really want emphasize zero doubt , zero . arguably done sooner . think -- give u enough time create compelling , integrated product -- assuming n't take forever close , give u time create compelling , integrated product bring significant scale next year . okay . say doubt . believe special committee independent board due diligence reverse due diligence company 'll reach -- 'll able reach agreement . seems likely -- board level yes . like board opinion unanimous company . mean , unless 's something discovered like idea nobody board idea , extremely unlikely , board would -- independent board member would recommend favor completing transaction somewhere price range mentioned , likely . would shareholder vote say , excluding , say yes . 's -- think 's fair one could make . great , thank much . congratulation . thanks . yes , mean , hear thing like hey , 's better way , morally better way better way execution standpoint let know . 've tried way fair possible really operator q - colin rusch - elon musk q - colin ruschgoing beyond 's legally required make legally correct morally correct . colin rusch , oppenheimer & co. thanks much . point going get financial detail ? clearly awful lot cross-pollination board : former cfo solarcity board tesla , jb board solarcity . 's lot sharing . price without sort scope return capital think would incredibly important u . going get information ? without 're begging detailing synergy think getting specific return capital tesla shareholder would essential getting done . going get information ? yes , agree . agree . todd saying , kind bit unwieldy way 'm largest shareholder company . n't case could lot kind present like full final detail proposed merger . -- since 'm largest shareholder company tell beginning process , end . certainly done . reason 's neat package sort odd case tell start process answer rather end process . definitely get information 'm confident extremely compelling . okay . second question around silevo . 's actually lot going term manufacturing solar point asian manufacturer reducing cost well excess expectation . certainly 's folk getting around import duty . even potential saving installation cost extra eﬃciency silevo look like n't going much cost advantage raw cost perspective look price point solar panel coming u solarcity would buy . talk little bit , 're begging - elon musk q - colin rusch - elon muskproduct detail . 're expecting able bring engineering process improve cost trajectory ? time get silevo factory running 's going , think , least $ 0.15 cost disadvantage target cost point . think 's something need get done make compelling offering . sure . tesla 're putting lot effort becoming world 's best manufacturer really mean . 's like 'm highly confident world 's best manufacturer . said build world 's best car , . spacex , said build world 's best rocket , . 're going world 's best manufacturer small margin margin people n't even think possible . believe taking first principle , physics-based approach analysis analysis situation dramatic improvement possible automotive side photovoltaic side . important advantage silevo technology significantly higher eﬃciency low-cost chinese panel . surface area roof , get much third power . aesthetically speaking silevo panel look better , look lot better . 's done right make roof look better solar panel without . night day difference . 've got , let 's say somebody 's got $ 400,000 house , make roof look ugly arguably 've made house worth 5 % le nonzero % le valuable . hand , make roof look beautiful 've made house valuable . maybe 's plus 5 % nonzero plus % value house . something order 5 % value delta , call $ 40,000 maybe 's like 2 % 3 % . 's $ 20,000 , 's like 's -- quite big value delta . able higher power look great think cost better , least good better 's coming anywhere else world , that's obviously winning outcome . 's outcome pursue think , 'm confident get . okay . follow . think question around process technology silevo ultimate -- q - colin rusch - elon musk q - colin rusch - elon musk q - colin ruschdo mean fundamental -- yes . fundamental process technology 're going get cost . think variety detailed question come back . follow-up question fundamentally solarcity specialty construction specialty finance entity heart . look tesla value-added manufacturer variety product technology company moving see fundamentally different business , seeing synergy come back tesla sale side ? something specialty finance expertise would bringing in-house ? actual boot ground , footprint solarcity incredibly important actually closing sale delivering thing versus footprint tesla 's customer base different concentrated footprint solarcity . seeing value come back tesla cost customer acquisition ? yes , mean think biggest asset 'd acquiring -- installers , installation team solarcity . lot people trained permitting paperwork complexity exist municipality throughout country understanding deal 37 different roof type eﬃcient logistics infrastructure installation . , mean think 's strength solarcity sale side take advantage . yes . really n't -- want emphasize think silevo technology going make quite big difference . n't see kind fundamental cost issue prevented lower cost per watt panel world . okay . thanks lot . 've spent time solarcity silevo power plant bay area 'm familiar . observation dramatic improvement . 's physical thing 's preventing super competitive , 's actually relatively straightforward manufacturing process . okay . thanks lot . - jeff evanson - todd maron operator q - joseph spak - elon musk elon todd , 's jeff . 've number people emailing question process , possible timeline . todd elon , want speak recap need vote , 's recused diligence disclosure shareholder vote might happen . might helpful . sure . take want . tesla side , board approved going forward offer , made announcement offer made . elon antonio , director board , recused vote . 're stage delivered offer solarcity . solarcity set board process end decide 's done , elon said , legally . morally correctly , 'm sure move diligence phase quickly . hopefully , diligence take place promptly . next two , three week get place everything make sense , 's signed merger agreement . point , everyone would receive merger agreement , well typical disclosure would provided time , combined financials , proxy statement everything 'd move shareholder vote . 're getting little bit . 's harder predict certainty . hope would would shareholder vote side next month . joseph spak , rbc capital market . thanks . guess wanted get sense much play think solarcity bet lower storage cost , meaning 've seen proposed change net metering law continues , 's , long business model work ? like need see following storage cost work confidence reason go forward deal ? yes . storage cost going drop pretty dramatically passing year think exclusion certain situation like nevada , maybe arizona , 're working mitigate , 'll ahead net metering situation . like new york , regional deal arranged basically get ahead net metering situation call roughly two three-year timeframe . 's certainly important long term although utility exaggerate impact solar grid , ultimately , impact solar grid beyond certain localized percentage impact need buffer q - joseph spak - elon musk q - joseph spak - elon muskpower . valid argument ; 's exaggerated . 's obviously important long term , yes , 's going work together well . world need . ultimate solution -- 're talking . solar power , stationary storage , electric car . solution . 're going try make happen fast possible fundamental good solarcity tesla measured degree accelerate transition . 're going try make happen fast possible think meaningful impact timeframe . maybe two real quick one . deal consummated , given thought plan provide segmented balance sheet cash ﬂow provide little bit transparency line ? technical point -- ? yes , think 's valuable transparency . want show transparency much . course , case , 's going like exactly cost allocated . wo n't great 's like black box people ca n't figure parse piece . n't want information discount start people certain . think clear information give people better understanding value company , various piece . inevitably lead people reach conclusion maybe n't reach premature . believe transparency . technical standpoint , talk greater seamlessness entity . would also consider allowing vehicle-to-grid support ? 've debated since early day roadster . early proto-roadsters vehicle-to-grid . get lot complication back ﬂow power car wall . like car allowed , much allow car battery drawn people , think , pretty upset light house . ca n't drive car power house shuts . think right solution decouple vehicle , stationary , battery solar . obviously probably need supplement power grid level utility scale , solar battery installation n't always enough service area house certainly apartment building , n't service area . 've got ground mount utility scale , solar battery system feedback grid . anyone seen power presentation , remarkable little land need power entire united state . 's crazy . like little corner texas utah , 's united state ' power . q - joseph spak - jeff evanson - elon musk - jeff evansonthen 's like one pixel inside box showed , box much land area need power united state like little box , like fit little texas panhandle , corner utah . inside box one pixel . that's surface area battery pack needed support entire united state , one pixel . 're going try grow fast u . throughout world . thanks . video , way , available website elon 's presentation tesla energy product . elon , half hour mark . nine questioner queue . defer determine long want go . ( multiple speaker ) . let 's try answer everyone 's question like said , really would encourage people think long term -- headed think think like long term , 's really question convergence tesla solarcity . 's really question timing appropriate convergence . 's basically solarcity 's product roadmap tesla 's product roadmap , obviously significant ( inaudible ) information . wish could tell . ca n't . timing , anything , maybe done sooner . certainly n't think 're early . 's long-term picture ? long-term picture world sustainable power generation , stationary storage buffer power electric car . tesla going leader three . believe 's future 're headed towards , everything point true . really like gasoline car , going look back gasoline car like look back steam engine . like phase . bit weird . 're going look back fossil fuel power generation way . weird phase . want get weird phase soon . accelerating u getting idiosyncratic moment history 're digging cambrian-level fossil burning . think telling grandchild , yes , wo n't believe used . used take liquidized remains dinosaur old plant put car burn move . thing power plant like . sound crazy . 's 's going future , obviously . yes , 're trying non-weird future get fast possible . let 's go next question , please . operator q - ben kallo - elon musk q - ben kallo - elon musktyler frank , robert baird . 's actually ben kallo baird . elon , wondering , understand working together cumbersome separate entity . could talk u difference actually owning solarcity versus maybe kind jv kind entity like help guy work issue ? yes . problem think hit -- n't good basis special deal solarcity 's effectively conﬂict interest . ironically , conﬂict interest go away 're one company . n't go away we're two separate company . like said , 's good rationale offering special deal working one company also happen . think good moral legal basis behaving special way solarcity unless 's actually one company . got . one , . could rank thing talked order look far revenue synergy cross-selling , technical synergy able work panel side , well battery side maybe third one , bucket , cost synergy forgot , maybe list well kind order 're thinking . thanks . yes , think 'll definitive answer process wrap . regard 'm saying anecdotal . 's kind way think gut standpoint like , first foremost , offer -- allows u offer compelling product consumer business seamlessly integrated product work together , 's better . like n't want heterogeneous system integration problem . 's basically interface break people pointing finger like n't work ; , thing n't work . 's one integrated system , finger-pointing , iron bug work . 're wondering blame solar company battery company know . 's like pain , pain butt try figure 're end customer . think guide integrated product right , better . 's kind -- standpoint anything else addition , 's obvious cost saving store sell twice much dollar volume . well 's store , selling twice much stuff . operator q - unidentified participant - elon musk q - unidentified participant operatorinﬂation crew , able knock three thing single visit rather schedule two three separate visit , 's also way better . much better ? 's definitely percentage better 's material , kind threshold making decision . 's obviously going lot better . cut business 2 3 1 , 've probably cut transport labor logistics cost maybe half , something like . seamless integrated product , le servicing cost thing going break le . 's thing 'd want buy end customer . would want buy anything else ? brian brinkman , jpmorgan . ( inaudible ) behalf brian . quick one u . conversation offer already largest disinterested shareholder tesla . 's sense term see value combining two business ? 's sense vote ? wanted make sure everyone heard time . 've discussed anyone wanted investor ( inaudible ) large [ ph ] hear time . separate apart , year , idea bandied larger shareholder , institutional shareholder ? yes . discussion think see natural thing . interesting look feedback 've received since made announcement yesterday . anyone product-focused sent congratulatory note like n't sooner sort message . people sort finance-focused , lot worried . long run , value company defined value product service . 's real important bear mind . 's company exist . n't exist otherwise . value company follow value product . company start making lousy product pretty soon going lousy valuation . product company make great product pretty soon going great valuation 's system set 's set . great . thank . patrick archambault , goldman sachs . q - patrick archambault - elon musk q - patrick archambault - elon musk great . thanks lot taking question . look , think lot laid strategic vision longer term . wanted piggyback one earlier question get sense possible financial sense make shorter term . correct 'm wrong , n't cover solarcity . understanding storage plus solar piece business actually quite small . 've place like rocky mountain institute put fairly detailed study combining solar plus storage . suggests levelized cost energy wo n't lower current available price maybe call 5 10 year . guy sound confident make sense sooner . wanted get view . yes , definitely . think important thing bear mind 's big world place cost energy much higher place . like example , hawaii , energy cost high ship fuel power plant . 's expensive economics solar plus battery make overwhelming sense place like hawaii lot actually island nation . really anyplace got expensive energy cost , even moderately expensive energy cost . 's going make sense many part europe , many part united state . , time , 's going make sense everywhere . everywhere going solar battery . wind , course , geothermal , hydro 'll longtail final coal plant finally stop operating , final natural gas plant stop operating . might last -- longtail 's going look like s-curve typical new technology adoption . 's like beginning s-curve people tend underpredict 's going happen go exponential growth phase approximately linear growth phase . usually people overpredict 's going happen steep linear portion growth phase go back logarithmic . complete s-shape . 's happened internet , example , cell phone . thing happen , yes . guess within united state , think five year reasonable timeframe economics start work ? yes . absolutely . le . need scale allows factory operate maximum capacity . think factory going operating maximum capacity far future see . production . meeting yesterday , guy , need figure ramp q - patrick archambault - elon musk q - patrick archambaultour production cell , battery , obviously car , faster addressing every limiting factor . mentioned whole thing manufacturing , machine build machine . order magnitude improvement think achieved . get right away . version 3 machine build machine , order magnitude . 's compared car manufacturing , look 'll seem like alien dreadnaught , like ( inaudible ) hell . ( inaudible ) people n't realize much improvement potential possible . thick . 're talking high school level physic necessary figure . 's like mega-complicated . go factory say volumetric density calculation . say percentage volume inside building useful stuff versus ( inaudible ) useful stuff . 'll shocked tiny percentage , like low single digit . velocity , exit velocity product ? fast thing moving exit ? 's mass ﬂow mdot factory ? 's like really low . like fastest car plant world , car exit velocity basically grandma walker . 's real slow , point 2 meter per second . 's really , really slow . could way better . like fastest person run 10 meter per second , faster 10 meter per second . car exit velocity 0.2 meter per second ? 's ridiculous . volumetric eﬃciency car factory -- usually 's mid low single digit . 's low . n't least volumetric density 30 % 40 % ? 30 % seems , achievable . nobody would design chip volumetric eﬃciency 2 % . would look ridiculous yet design factory way . eﬃciencies looking put place next tesla plant , thing see fremont stage near future ? 'll see thing moving direction . model 3 , think 're -- 're aspiring get version 0.5 alien dreadnought level -- alien dreadnought level like version 3. 'll certainly see directionally . 's obvious cell production . engineering team work closely panasonic make dramatic improvement cell manufacturing eﬃciency think probably approaching 3x eﬃciency best plant world . that's pretty good . 's still lot room improvement . cell going thing like bullet machine gun . fact , exit rate cell faster bullet machine gun . well look forward next time take u around . - elon musk operator q - colin langan - elon musk q - colin langan - elon musk q - colin langan operator q - patrick jobin yes . come gigafactory party ; 'll eye-opener . colin langan , ubs . oh , great . thanks taking question . lot analyst cover solarcity highlighting major liquidity concern company . sounded pretty confident going turn cash ﬂow positive . think seeing differently concerned cash burn may increase deal ? think deal done , cash burn likely reduce reduced cost sale general operational eﬃciencies , like 's lot thing that's duplicated , duplicated . 'd expect cost decrease increase positive cash ﬂow solarcity acquisition . yes , might take like month come effect . pretty short order . let 's say six month acquisition complete , would expect eﬃciencies significant . 's second question . term time horizon , term delivering goal promise , particularly around acquisition , actually think synergy could achieved within six month post-closing , would quick ? yes , think point deal done , yes . meaningful noticeable . second full quarter acquisition completed . 'm highly confident case , yes . okay . thank taking question . patrick jobin , credit suisse . thanks taking question . guess question elon todd . pursue le capital-intensive model least near term proceed - elon musk q - patrick jobin - elon musk q - patrick jobin - jeff evanson operator q - dana hall - elon muskmore marketing sale relationship entity guess cross- sell opportunity installation eﬃciencies integrated system ? seems like , think used term special deal . seem norm entity beneficial . guess legal impediment approached synergy fashion ? think would certainly face . yes , still think -- think morally legally would find diﬃcult defend unique relationship favored solarcity 're separate company . 're one company obviously 's fine . separate company , ca n't . -- . okay . second question , everyone focused capital cash ﬂow . guess , elon , perspective , would tesla receptive , would plan provide capital solarcity interim pending acquisition ? obviously , 'm thinking solarcity side . given saw vivint sunedison , pending acquisition disrupted access capital market . interim , 'm trying understand solarcity 's near-term path 'd willing tesla standpoint . thank . since solarcity constrained short term going raising equity , tesla would provide bridge loan , needed . actually n't think 's going needed , clear , 's something 's fair appropriate . needed . n't think needed . okay . thank . three caller question . let 's try wrap quick . everybody brief , would great . 're coming 90 minute . dana hall , bloomberg news . could talk little bit envision impacting tesla 's retail footprint going forward . tesla store selling solar panel power wall , effective end run around dealership battle ? q - dana hall - elon musk operator q - sachin shah - elon muskthat 's interesting question . yes . 're limited store term selling solar stationary storage . could potentially offer car gallery format , something like . open additional option retail front , actually , mention . 'm wondering whether car dealer association say 's dealership 's selling car , 's also selling solar panel power wall going change look store significantly enough help guy ? think 'll still prevented actually including car transaction , even part broader store . usually limit gallery simply display car information . could look conclude transaction solar battery . yes . something like , open additional possibility mention . sachin shah , albert fried . follow-up . mentioned positive rolling solarcity think somebody earlier mentioned many word analyst saying bailout solarcity . mention , shareholder vote , happens ? mentioned solarcity next 3 six month net cash generator . 's bleak analyst saying . solarcity would position n't vote potential transaction tesla . , secondly , deal mean gigafactory ? change ? timeline changed going capacity ? thank . sure . n't know bailout come tesla one deciding market value solarcity . stock market . solarcity could certainly raise capital equity current valuation think without problem . solarcity headed think healthy place cash ﬂow standpoint short order . next sort 3 five month getting cash ﬂow positive . company around corner cash ﬂow positive ability raise equity capital , n't see acquisition way bailout . 's obviously false description . gigafactory proceeds penalty [ ph ] solarcity except obviously 've geared product -- storage product geared towards solarcity-type system . something would explicitly exclusionary solar company , q - sachin shah operator q - brian lee - elon musk operatorway , would solar company would match solarcity product order use battery product effectively . 's trying shut solar company , 's able guide product need go 'll right thing solar company also guiding product match . 're going basically jerk solar company . really laser- focused compelling consumer solution . 's , think , right thing . okay . thank much . congratulation . hank elder , goldman sachs . actually brian lee hank . three housekeeping question , along deal . interest time , 'll run quickly . first , given solarcity 's relationship various lender tax equity fund structure , hoping could talk visibility potential change control provision and/or exposure clawback provision solar tax credit might exist . second question would , part due diligence , board consider alternative solarcity ? third one , pas , collar cap stock exchange ratio proposed . , 's rationale ? thanks . kind beginning analysis , end . normally , 'd lot closer end 'm largest shareholder company . something talk beginning n't answer . compile present shareholder decision month come . obviously part diligence process 'll talking lender , making sure comfortable . think 's good idea . pretty sure . 're going talk . yes . term company , consider part initial diligence process . think solarcity best company leader field . silevo technology . product direction believe correct term making rapid progress towards highly differentiated product . 's company 's like , . q - trip chowdhry - elon musk - jeff evanson - elon musk - jeff evanson operatortrip chowdhry , global equity research . quick question elon . wondering , acquisition play opportunity tesla may find micro-grids grid space ? yes , think 's always good productize thing .
