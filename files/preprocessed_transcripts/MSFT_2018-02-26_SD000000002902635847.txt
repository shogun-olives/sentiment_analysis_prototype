's true whether 're person listening web . excellent . satya , thank coming . welcome tmt conference . thank . much , keith . thanks inviting . question answer dinner portfolio manager last week . talking microsoft . noted tenure , joined microsoft -- took ceo role , microsoft ( $ 304 billion ) market cap . today , stand $ 725 billion . said , 's hard believe one person , one man 's kind changed course company -- company thinking legacy , tired technology company mobile cloud innovator , right ? someone 's nimble term innovation . share u little bit happened ? know . mean , read book . talk lot senior leadership team . aligned everybody right direction . pointed ship got moving much forward direction microsoft aimed . yes , mean , couple thing , keith . mean , way think life microsoft day became ceo . 've microsoft 25 year . q - keith wei - satya nadellaclearly , responsibility accountability unquestionably today ceo . therefore , even trying take credit happened last four year without realizing franchise bet bill steve played -- know -- wrong . business n't get built way . thing n't -- thing last long take long build . even every startup 's successful 10 year , 15 year even ipo . 's time frame think . core , one thing 've come realize 's -- everything going great , business growing core growing 20 % celebrating growth , 's really need watch question , `` happens ? '' 's thing perpetual motion machine . original concept , idea hit eventually going run gas . mean need built capability allows get new concept long 's conventional wisdom . fact , long many give u permission even invest . mean got management team know bet future long , sense , 's conventional wisdom . enables organization ? believe 's culture . enables organization insight . 's ability everyday courage make bet , learn mistake , knowing 're going make fair share . 's art form . science , every company would talk would long-term successful . 's . 's think 's excessive celebration short-term win lack understanding , think , real sustainable building business . right . book , talk lot 3 c , right , concept , capability culture key success . dig little bit u sort apply ? apply term -- senior leadership team make sure people focused way ? think 3 c enabling next $ 100 billion coming microsoft ? yes , mean , 's similar , mean , talked . would say . somebody said , `` got careful talking culture investor culture love yogurt . '' 's sort -- ca n't plug spreadsheet change something . probably important thing 's enables build capability . 'll give example , take silicon . point , 's clear day , whether thing edge thing cloud , need silicon capability . look sophistication margin structure whether cloud business anything else going change going around smart silicon . course , got started journey , quite frankly , work xbox many moon ago . n't like xbox silicon team cloud silicon team different silicon team . one capability people able tape new silicon help u innovation . culture cultivates great silicon engineer come , join , work silicon industry , . 's u building . shape ecosystem frontier innovation , , , important long-term indicator . n't mean -- catch q - keith wei - satya nadella q - keith wei - satya nadellanew trend . 're going perfect batting average . case , look 43 year history , 've fair share big win . 've also fair share loss . 's ability capability culture allows keep going back every day making judgment call high percentage winning . got . let 's dig sort technology trend future opportunity microsoft 's working . first one want talk artificial intelligence machine learning . mentioned ai ultimate breakthrough technology . ? think kind ultimate breakthrough , certainly one biggest new idea microsoft facing today ? yes , mean , fact , picking even last question going ai piece , -- asked even , next microsoft ? feel one key thing done position core mission company core business model company really tune time . 2018 , mission business model creating surplus around every community , every country operate , going long-term business . said , plenty opportunity . 'll sort explore . ai going one trend going next big shift technology . 's going ai edge , ai cloud , ai part saas application , ai part , fact , even infrastructure . , leading , sort ai capability exercise . ability democratize every business truly benefit , , , least identity around ai . got . think -- talk ai machine learning , 's -- perspective , 's 2 sort big side equation . one capability technology , . able apply real business problem . think 've talked often one side equation . want start . term microsoft capability , like guiding microsoft ensure 're running , 're vendor customer looking towards think machine learning , think cognitive service , coming platform versus -- 's big competitor ? yes . twofold . one , course , technology . mean , take even recent machine reading comprehension test stanford , # 1 alibaba another # 1. look speech , hold wr -- wer record still . computer vision , first original imagenet record held u . sense , got , whether 's speech , whether 's reasoning , whether machine reading vision , got capability . 's something q - keith wei - satya nadellawe . applying application , look oﬃce 365 cortana capable . even morning , cortana woke sort talked couple commitment made e-mail following . 's actual machine reading comprehension work . long term , though , feel . like let 's say , 2 3 company ai capability-wise . question every customer , whether 's financial service company , whether 's retailer , whether manufacturer , going ask , `` trust ? '' especially world 's going transfer learning . one largest transfer wealth happen pick supply chain wrong . fundamental trust partner , supplier entrusting data , going help reason top create ai one trusted partnership . think 's purity business model , , fundamentally consumption-based subscription-based , funky cross-subsidies marketplace structure multiple business one side compete side partner . think people going see . like recently , talked bank ceo . one first question asked , pretty stunning , 's state rl ? '' said , wow , bank ceo asking reinforcement learning . mean real awakening ai trajectory ai going . therefore , fully expect asking hard question technology partner really trust long-term interest -- whose long-term interest aligned long-term interest . right . even research department morgan stanley , 've talked lot vendor vendor machine learning capability artificial intelligence . past year , feel like lot conversation vendor coming u saying , `` capability . ? '' right , versus coming u real solution . customer talking guy machine learning , artificial intelligence ? bridge gap set new , innovative , really interesting capability , able automate part work one 's ever done real business problem getting solve real domain problem customer ? yes , mean -- think , even , would say last couple year , 've seen marked difference term , 's technology technology 's sake . 's even technology evolution path dependent . take -- asked previous question , `` 's differentiated , say , speech service vision service ? '' one differentiated aspect ability customize . 's generic api call . example , certain fast food restaurant using speech service , trained ambient noise drive-thrus . 's customized application . order entry point sale much accurate . computer vision customization happening manufacturing line somebody want really get highly accurate around detecting defect , customize . ability tool chain make possible business take business process add machine learning ai make much q - keith wei - satya nadella q - keith weissproductive much eﬃcient , think , real innovation . 's technology . able really deliver deployed solution . 2 approach deployed solution . one highly consultative sale . 's place . lot partner going good job . job , traditionally microsoft always done , bring world-class tool . , think 's happening visual studio tool ai ability developer ai expert . yet able roll ai solution , 's place -- like happened client/server database , 's think world ai also going . got . investor question get often machine learning/ai , impact yet ? actually driving new business ? accelerating workload term people ? perspective , think 're yet capability actually driving workload growth ? sure , . 's early day . let 's take -- people describe iot . 's fascinating see workload path , , iot project , , let 's take anything 's edge , take even manufacturing context . collecting lot data . take data rendezvous edge well cloud . lot data , reason data prediction . ultimately , ai translates 2 thing , whether 's predictive power analytical power . case , let 's say predict failure . right , need translate prediction action . see growth something like field service get someone going go fix thing 's broken . ability take something growth edge , growth data , growth ai tool used preventive maintenance , growth field service , 's happening scale today . ai ? data ? business application ? 's one reason like think broader platform effect opposed narrow application . got . shifting gear little bit . want talk quantum . morgan stanley research -- tech research team , put report quantum computing last summer . would say consensus feedback client , guy crazy . talking quantum ? quantum 's 5 , 10 year . science fiction 're writing . later , , think , two month later , stage developer conference , build developer conference . 're talking quantum computing real capability microsoft's investing lot , microsoft 's going bringing capability field , 5- , 10-year time frame . something much sooner . help u frame topic audience ? help -- help get read report quantum computing ? yet ? term sort getting technology production-ready ? - satya nadella q - keith wei - satya nadella yes . think opportunity front u , look people using compute azure compute seems insatiable term need , feature development application , oﬃce 365 dynamic xbox . look , clear need compute . reaching limit current architecture , whether 's moore 's law 's von neumann machine architectural limitation . 's quantum come . taken approach instead trying go solve narrow problem quantum achieve , let 's even say quantum supremacy , real challenge quantum computer always going , `` going enough qubits stabilized way general-purpose compute ? '' mean error correction challenge enormous quantum world 're going able many qubits error correction . 's uniqueness least approach . 've got fundamental mathematical theory called topological theory . field medal winner sort done groundbreaking work . couple world- class physicist trying instantiate topological matter physical way . 's majorana particle trying basically discover exhibit topological matter . guess ? 're going need complete new computer science stack program previously . that's interesting 've -- sort put simulator azure started seeing 's belief world need compute . many , many people , excited , oil gas many field saying , `` wow . need come new solution big , long-standing computational problem . '' see early adoption azure simulator . right . think one -- mean , 's -- 2 big differentiator saw microsoft approach . one , fundamentally , physic guy looking approach different competitor . although forum , n't want get much topological qubits . , also really interesting , fact guy entire stack , 're developing across entire stack . 's hardware . software top . talk u sort 3-layer approach hardware , interface sort software algorithm top actually going enable get real work done sooner ? well mean , 's -- look , think first phase u build 3 layer . said , think key u fundamental breakthrough physic allow u stabilize qubits scale able build container general-purpose computer , requires breakthrough even cryo computing able achieve . place think going shine -- beyond going groundbreaking work physic side , going software stack . sense , go back first question . company , spite whatever q - keith wei - satya nadella q - keith wei - satya nadellanew technology capability , something innate . look microsoft , started basic interpreter , whatever , 43 year ago . 's back basic sense . 're going start tool chain quantum . 's point quantum computer 2 people somewhere program ? got able quantum computer everybody program . 's least think going differentiate . right . 's interesting , time , instead open underlying hardware preexisting hardware infrastructure , guy also develop hardware infrastructure 're creating interpreter software language top . 's right . big capital spender today cloud side , 's actually pretty logical u forefront quantum . 's many , many , many pit stop quantum . fact , look even road map behind term investment quantum , 're going need many dividend investment long quantum . yes . want shift gear little bit something brought earlier , idea trust . get asked question lot , microsoft -- microsoft competing amazon web service microsoft 's competing google cloud compute , win ? technology ? breadth service ? think 's another aspect within . part 's trust part 's understanding customer 's business problem -- business problem bringing real solution . talk u technology industry broadly , think trust , maintaining trust end customer , keep right side ? 's lot different -- talk book lot . 's lot different force pushing wrong direction sort make diﬃcult guy maintain trust customer . yes , believe , sit 2018 , probably issue time going go away anytime soon . sort -- reason straightforward 's walk life , sector economy anywhere world 's impacted fundamentally digital technology . start premise , one question every head state meet local community leader meet ask , `` hi . mean u ? whatever talk term technology , -- think creating surplus region ? '' 's feel microsoft's fundamental grounding mission empowering every person every organization planet achieve super important . 's set word . guide choice make business 're , business model . said , surplus creates . sort go new york q - keith wei - satya nadella q - keith weissor istanbul anywhere say , `` microsoft 's contribution small business productivity , public sector eﬃciency , multinational competitiveness , educational health outcome . '' course , ip- based business . need return . 's factor production creation wealth surplus . , believe , going 's going important long term . collect rent create surplus , 's way people going allow . mean , -- start . 's company branded one . 's core -- country branded , 's every company evaluated business model ability deliver , think , long-term surplus 's evenly spread . okay . big part equation trust security ability ensure customer data going secure cloud , environment . investor think microsoft , think microsoft company secures data , secures user , inherent platform ? microsoft actually security company ? bringing new capability new skus , , new product marketplace providing security broadly ? mean , security category , sort look across 's happening offering window , offering oﬃce 365 azure , 's probably fastest growing cybersecurity massive need across segment , across market . n't think security stand-alone . even ask , securing user , securing data ? 's everything . 's securing data . 's securing user . 's ensuring security technology protects one time . 's operational security posture . ask , even spectre meltdown , one thing marked difference ability take issue , processor design issue , come fix mitigation , get deployed , say , cloud rapidly customer even spend money . operational security posture allows u see threat mitigate threat important technology . investing , heavily . 's also -- security always going intelligence game . 's technology game . 's security operational security go together . also going open ecosystem . 's u technology . make sure overall investment security leading better customer outcome think one many -- one thing slow technology security challenge slow adoption . therefore , 's even responsibility beyond sort monetization . right . talk customer talk progression oﬃce 365 e1 e3 e5 , one probably -- top response get back 's drawing people stack security , discrete security functionality expand . monetization angle . monetization security technology 're deploying stack . - satya nadella q - keith wei - satya nadella oh , sure . mean , said , whether -- migration e1 e5 , whether 's window oﬃce 365 describe microsoft 365 , clearly , security one value proposition . broader point , one thing think perhaps revelation move oﬃce , `` oh , used run exchange oﬃce 365 , '' 's one-for-one move . mean , look overall market opportunity considered oﬃce franchise . broadly , think window oﬃce franchise today 's world . think , heyday client/server , n't sell server small business india . opportunity penetrate exchange lync server . whereas , . sell subscription small business everywhere . also value proposition , whether compliance , whether security , whether 's voice . -- rich capability , , possible u across level . , something never previously . also , first line . one interesting thing last year 've seen company really deploying technology field service people , retail specialist . 's another . 's e-mail knowledge worker collaboration knowledge worker . 's even first-line worker . fact , hololens , highest volume hololens 's deployed first line . think , growth opportunity oﬃce 365 lot bigger anything achieved , even high penetration client/server world . right . want shift gear talk recent business performance . first topic want talk -- great segue , thank -- microsoft cloud . 's probably biggest outperformance -- term investor expectation past two year , particular guy able azure . think last quarter saw acceleration growth $ 1 billion-plus scale business . 's driving strong kind return investment guy made ? 's differentiating microsoft , particularly azure level , versus really big competitor head start term -- least term marketplace infrastructure service platform service capability ? yes , mean , -- pleased progress making azure . think start fundamental differentiated point view computing going . describe intelligent cloud intelligent edge distributed computing , never believed even multiple year ago 's somehow going become one centralized service . 's going remain distributed . look -- talked ai previously , need inference capability edge . new workload , need even training capability edge amount data 's going get generated need reasoned real-time take action require compute storage . think building , describe hybrid computing architecture intelligent cloud intelligence , feel 're , fact , leading change today . beyond , think see q - keith wei - satya nadellasecular market demand type computing . every industry every country digitized , one thing need core infrastructure . participate core infrastructure , edge cloud . participate data layer . participate lot higher-level paas service , whether ai others . therefore , feel differentiated point view , execution differentiated marketplace today . long term , -- , like talked oﬃce 365 , good business server business . business order magnitude bigger used successful server business . right . 'm going ask one question open audience make sure could take question . turning oﬃce 365 , want ask think term sort progression market opportunity . 's -- view , 's 2 dimension -- 's kind 3 dimension . penetration traditional oﬃce space , getting people convert . 's expansion capability sort selling guy . 's third one guy kind brought equation recently n't think lot investor thinking microsoft 365 , 's oﬃce , 's going window space well sort pushing direction . perspective , kind like inning ? term sort building oﬃce 365 , microsoft 365 base ? yes . 's real question asked trying build single saas service even single operating system . able build rich information model enables user group user organization productive , able collaborate , help , fact , impact cultural outcome organization scale . think microsoft 365 , ability rich information model people , relationship people , schedule , project , collaborating . think , mean , would encourage use outlook even io device go look person 's contact . look person 's contact , going see , first , contact information . also going able see linkedin connection . . 's beautiful thing called organization . people work . look say , `` oh , yes , must org chart view . '' 's org chart view . 's dynamic view colleague , fact , working project . creates one dream organization ( sort ) , create boundaryless organization ? create collaboration ? instigates collaboration ? 's way think . 're building operating system device . 're building single app . thinking user group user building operating system . window part . window -- oﬃce part . android . io device . n't care . want able really help user productivity collaboration organization want . 's expansive nature . way , security going part . productivity . 's trust security well . q - keith wei - satya nadella q - keith wei q - unidentified participant - satya nadella right . 's user interface . really information underneath 's tying together ? user interface important element . , gave experience example outlook . experience powered rich information model experience reinforce information model allow u create rich experience . feedback cycle 's important . excellent . want take opportunity take question audience . front . talk think use cash respect shareholder return versus & ? 've got $ 100 billion repatriate . 's 1.5 year since linkedin acquisition . 're thinking priority ? mean , look , mean , whether -- 're always going balanced approach capital allocation . look done , even last multiple year , whether dividend , buyback , & done . example , take linkedin . mean , fact ahead plan stated acquisition super important u 's one thing & . 's completely different thing & follow plan stated 's true measure ability realize benefit spending shareholder money . feel good way balanced approach . fundamentally , look opportunity ahead , think -- across 3 segment , 4 big , big opportunity . talked lot azure azure edge opportunity . 's massive . early inning world need term core infrastructure . opportunity business application , n't even talk much yet . small player big market 's growing . think another huge place . fact , one big breakthrough u , beyond growth dynamic 365 , even last quarter grew 70 % , power bi . went nowhere leader bi cloud . grew 3 -- 3x last year . think we're going end year $ 0.5 billion billing annualized run rate , tremendous . mean . took investment multiple year . real number . say -- business application , let 's go oﬃce 365. think clear , microsoft 365 , term , whether 's small business growth , whether 's first-line growth , richness application , security gaming . gaming another place fundamentally going trying build gaming service say , console going important u , continue place heaviest gamers . pc gaming device , fact , increasing popularity . ability build xbox live q - keith wei q - unidentified participant - satya nadella q - keith wei - satya nadellaas network subscription service , 's another huge opportunity . core question , think best shareholder looking expansive opportunity investing wisely . balance dimension , whether 's dividend buyback & fit core strategy . excellent . let 's try sneak one last one . question really around gaming . spend little bit time talking gaming opportunity . know touched little bit , role microsoft plan play , quarter quarter , longer term , outlook e- gaming , xbox , technology , core competency longer term ? yes , mean , u , 're happy core gaming asset . asset got built loved brand xbox well pc gaming . one thing people recognized owner . therefore even xbox xbox live , particular , across 2 really helped u grow engagement xbox live . we'll continue . play-anywhere game subscription , think beginning going transition . much like described microsoft 365 , transition gaming , console going super important , pc going super important . ultimately , 's people ability game anywhere . 's going . whether subscription offering game pas , whether 's mixer , growing rapidly term streaming . esports franchise around first-party game . think many , many lever . fundamentally , come heritage gaming business multiple decade point built capability world ability take service much broader marketplace ever . excellent . unfortunately , take u end allotted time . thank much joining u , satya . thank . much . thank , , much .
