thank much . yes . absolutely , recommend , think , 2 model 3 navigate autopilot , basically highway autonomy , available customer . basically wanted walk business 're trying go . first thing , think , many would already know , 3 product currently sell vehicle , vast majority gross profit ; storage ; generation , solar generation . think automotive industry general , think one thing notice automotive industry , today , spread across various different technology . word , every single carmaker need continue invest gas-powered diesel-powered engine , time , 're investing fuel cell , ev , plug-in hybrid , mild hybrid , et cetera , et cetera . 're really focusing one thing one thing get electric car work , get cheap possible , et cetera , et cetera . order build model 3 , build largest battery factory world , gigafactory reno . 'm wanting put something unidentified participant martin viechaperspective significant factory . last year , 2018 , look non-tesla electric vehicle sold around world , total number battery used non-tesla ev 46 gigawatt hour battery . 's 1.1 million non-tesla ev sold last year time roughly average 49 kilowatt hour average battery pack size . 's 46 gigawatt hour global production electric vehicle battery . capacity today . installed capacity today , 44 gigawatt hour , 's 35 gigawatt hour gigafactory , reno remaining 9 gigawatt hour panasonic japan . size absolutely matter come reducing cost making battery . thing wanted point look epa range highest range vehicle market today , range model -- 'm sure thing laser . model range orange bar middle . upper right side ... tried click . n't anything . anyways , 's fine . range model seven year ago still beaten electric car introduced since . time , model range increased seven year 100 mile . roughly 270 mile 370 mile today . really fascinating thing model , left part chart , almost battery size audi e-tron right side chart . one range 204 mile , one range 370 mile , yet battery pack size roughly . difference come powertrain . think underrated technology conversation investor come there's general feeling anyone make powertrain , anyone make electric motor . electric motor around decade . true , make electric motor incredibly eﬃcient , fast acceleration , high top speed , cheap make last 1 million mile , attribute combined actually , complicated . important part far energy eﬃciency . know , example , mpg . example , toyota corolla much better mpg chevy camaro . metric look , equivalent metric , mile per kilowatt hour . 's easy calculate . , take epa range electric vehicle . 310 mile model 3 divided battery size get 4.0 mile per kilowatt hour eﬃciency . -- see difference model 3 rest industry quite substantial . 's part story . second part story acceleration actually significantly faster well . better acceleration , better top speed best-in-class eﬃciency . chart basically telling model 3 pretty much half battery size , half cost compared e-tron still epa range . -- take combination take , okay , battery pack relatively cheap build motor enables long range , 's result combination 2 thing ? trailing 12 month u.s. electric vehicle delivery . 's 2 thing wanted highlight chart : number one , 100 % growth coming single product , model 3 ; thing wanted highlight , orange bar orange area bottom actually gently declining . ev combined , 's chevy bolt , nissan leaf , jaguar i-pace , audi e-tron . . fact 've seen absolutely growth non-tesla electric vehicle sale past 2.5 year , yet 's quite new entrant came market quite odd . reason new car maker coming ev , yet 's absolutely impact volume ? would actually say # 1 reason country mile price car . electric vehicle -- 5 popular electric vehicle u.s. would say price electric vehicle u.s. extremely high compared gas-powered equivalent . look left , see audi e-tron base price $ 75,000 . buy $ 50,000 slightly bigger , slightly faster audi q7 . 's story i-pace , story chevy bolt nissan leaf . they're dramatically expensive gas-powered competitor . hand , look model 3 , model 3 's price -- model 3 first electric vehicle history 's priced par gas-powered equivalent . word , subsidy , tax incentive , fuel saving , base ticket price par gas-powered equivalent . actually , model 3 basic equipment autopilot , satellite navigation , parking sensor lot kit would pay car brand . give customer choice , give equal choice -- roughly price , get ev get combustion engine vehicle , result . le 12 month sale , model 3 started outsell bmw 3 series , audi a4 , lexus , mercedes c-class jaguar xe combined . -- 've never seen automotive industry , maybe '70s toyota corolla came u.s. market first time completely blitzed competition . 's extremely rare see industry . 's one point . since july 2018 , one year later , happened . last 12 month . , model 3 substantially higher number sale main competitor combined . reason ? lot people say , hey , carmaker going start ev . well mean mercedes c-class , 's going electric version , going sell 3 time many unit regular c-class ? probably . 's probably something else vehicle people like electricity . actually , like short list thing think different model 3 car . reason people want buy model 3. firstly , ground-up design . design vehicle ground electric , extend interior space . highly recommend going drive later , see interior space quite bit bigger equivalent gas engine vehicle simply 's gas engine extend interior size . secondly , decluttered interior . 'm sure remember using iphone first time 2007 2008. felt bit weird compared using blackberry , right , like probably missing button . diﬃcult text . month , realized way back . 's much nicer decluttered , nice simple interface . 's exactly tried model 3. software update , 4g . another thing 's , think , fairly fascinating . apple introduced software update 12 year ago . introduced software update car seven year ago . 'm aware carmaker introduced software update ﬂeet even , significant amount time passing . supercharger . learned 's basically impossible mass sell electric vehicle without charging network people n't buy car 90 % journey 95 % journey . people buy car 100 % journey . result , absolutely need supercharging network allow people long- distance travel . store . important one , much customer ' perspective . mostly business perspective . dealership , generally speaking , want sell electric vehicle . n't want sell electric vehicle maintenance cost reoccurring revenue profit generation pretty limited electric vehicle . 's carmaker really -- sorry , dealership really incentivized sell many ev . 's exactly many carmaker forced build dealer network , bmw , dealer network able sell ev . lastly , course , autopilot . thing wanted speak many people tell , well , unsustainable . massive gap u versus competitor combined n't make sense . 's sustainable . 's actually something behind . 12 % trade-in -- database trade-in 've ever received people buying model 3. people traded vehicle , 12 % driving another midsize premium sedan , like c-class mercedes , like bmw 3 series , et cetera . 25 % came premium vehicle . mercedes suv bmw 5 series , et cetera , et cetera , completely different car . 63 % coming nonpremium vehicle . every single year , portion population transfer nonpremium premium . disproportionately , group people , 're choosing model 3. 're sort grabbing -- people jump , say , corolla camrys car first entry premium . 's disproportional model 3. mean cash generation ? chart volume volume grown thanks model 3. overlay free cash ﬂow , see 's quite bit similarity . free cash ﬂow , mean operating cash ﬂow minus capex . main debate q2 far gross margin . 's topic i've getting far question . gross margin -- headline number declined . 20 % 19 % . see take regulatory credit , underlying gross margin actually improved 200 basis point 17.2 % q2 . 's global expansion approach ? go ? well today . 're making model 3 fremont , california . basically build 're currently building simpler version production line shanghai , china . building similar vehicle , suv , suv based model 3 , called model , 78 % component commonality model 3. we're going build fremont , california bit year . basically take copy-paste approach model china europe . course , top , 're preparing new product well . pickup truck unveil , hopefully , later year . semi truck roadster . people ask -- 've working automotive industry life , main difference tesla every carmaker every automotive-related company ever worked . 's -- far # 1 difference seen pace innovation . 'll try give one example . original roadster . stopped making original roadster 2012. time , able produce 10 unit week . n't -- probably q - unidentified participant - martin viecha q - unidentified participant - martin viecha q - unidentified participant - martin viecha q - unidentified participantwas n't good car . five year later , started produce model 3 , hailed journalist one best car ever made . make 5,000 , 6,000 week consistently . 's easily 70 % cheaper make original roadster . five year later . also look 's happening shanghai , gigafactory shanghai january year . remember time picture started come online want start producing car end year , like madness . six month later , look like . actually , 's shell . look inside , 's story . 's stamping press getting ready robot ( ) body welding . 're , hopefully , going start inviting investor shanghai early next year people see important part next leg growth story company . thank much . question answer ( inaudible ) sir , shelf life ... usability . long car work ? well 's ... ( inaudible ) got . 's -- well , model 3 , warranty 120,000 mile , essentially roughly mileage -- 's roughly scrappage mileage car america . car get scrapped , average , would 120,000 , 150,000 mile clock . gave warranty 120,000 mile . think battery also 8-year warranty . course , mean , 've model s x run 200,000 , 300,000 , 400,000 mile . 're still working . talk little bit storage generation ( inaudible ) ? - martin viecha q - unidentified participant - martin viecha q - unidentified participant - martin viecha q - unidentified participant absolutely . storage generation , think , 'm personally much excited storage part growth 've seen -- really strong . last year , deployed 1 gigawatt hour energy storage . year , we're going roughly double number . fairly significant growth continue year well . recently launched new product called megapack . used powerwall , powerpack megapack . megapack essentially incredibly large version battery pack deployed quickly around world peaker plant want attach existing factory , et cetera , et cetera . course , 're currently negotiating several different party , whether 's different government different state , installation megapacks . 's bit 'm excited . ( inaudible ) correct . essentially , cell production n't right place time . decided divert cell model 3 . cell production significantly better . start selling powerwalls higher volume . used , wanted buy powerwall year ago , would like six month waiting time . 's lot better . get one pretty quickly . mentioned store part strategy . going number store ? last year , elon -- month ago , elon said 'd close , rationalize ( ﬂows sale ) . 's current situation ? yes , think 's -- n't opening new store . closed . many . main thing 're focusing service center . trying open many service center possibly . think opened like 26 service center last quarter . added 100 vehicle mobile service ﬂeet . service center , think , believe , main driver . need infrastructure . long people see service city bunch supercharging station city , like , 's going make go online buy car . store growth , 've noticed , historically , really generate much demand . portion customer test driven car ? - martin viecha q - unidentified participant - martin viecha q - unidentified participant - martin viecha q - unidentified participant - martin viecha q - unidentified participant - martin viecha q - unidentified participant -- think last number gave statistic end q1 . -- would say , past year , number model 3 bought without test drive 70 % . super high . 's simply , think , people read review online . review great . friend take drive somebody else take drive . 's car buy instead . 's peer . people buy . data whether 've actually driven another vehicle , et cetera ? . would n't data . . , mean , reason ask ( would ) ask question vehicle purchase ( inaudible ) small % . correct . absolutely . question , actually make available , 's going line ( inaudible ) . actually make available , demand ( would likely ) little bit higher , ? potentially . yes . like , theory , 's lot thing could . moment , think 're still phase 's lot growth opportunity europe , example . sorry ? production ... n't want talk detail 's sensitive topic . we've already talked last earnings call . ... ( inaudible ) - martin viecha q - unidentified participant - martin viecha q - unidentified participant - martin viecha q - unidentified participant - martin viecha generally speaking , like u.s. , 're outselling competitor combined . europe , 're outselling single one main competitor . 's much potential growth europe . u.k. , specifically , example , think worry . maybe one -- fact , one question . ( inaudible ) know , anniversary 's tomorrow . ( inaudible ) 40 % ( growth ) capital -- capex -- mainly capex declining steadily . fund growth talk presentation cost equity cost debt going ( equity ) ? -- go back presentation ? mean , see actually happening . 's like u presenting u . real building 's going start producing . thing wanted highlight : deployment step 2 , model , going uncomparably cheaper deployment model 3 simply much production line shared 3 , capex necessary going fraction needed model 3. second thing wanted mention many carmaker building new factory , building new plant around world ? many , . result , go kuka fanuc component supplier , fact company building factory get reﬂected . lastly , payment term capex side better 've ever . 's . thank . thank .
