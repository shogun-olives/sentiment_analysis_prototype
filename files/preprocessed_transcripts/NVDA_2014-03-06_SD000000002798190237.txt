welcome , everyone . joe moore . welcome day four morgan stanley tmt conference . chris evenden investor relation . thanks , chris . thanks . glad . best chair conference 've . oh yes ? well -- put pillow like lying back . thought maybe could kind walk revenue stream little bit maybe go expense stuff . went give chance address kind concern raised around intel royalty . give -- leave plenty time question . guess starting revenue , guy really good quarter gpu . feel like kind something heard place , . mean intel record quarter i7 desktop . desktop enthusiast market , really pretty strong throughout week period ( inaudible ) -- yes . 's great . -- nice uptick . think drove uptick . tell u 2014 ? chris evenden joe moore chris evenden well 've fairly consistent way 've talked . talk geforce business , consumer graphic business , talk two segment within . talk gaming segment oem segment . two segment different dynamic . oem segment weak probably decline . gaming segment , however , strong continues grow . clearly , 's currently outweighing decline oem segment . drove particular strength q4 one , seasonally strongest quarter . seasonally strongest quarter good game come , people n't tend buy graphic card want new graphic card . buy new graphic card batman arkham origin released go caped crusader 40 hour . drove lot strength q4 . game -- one interesting thing hope tip trend game came china called blazing soul , much graphically- intensive game typical market . china biggest geforce market far . tend lower asp game tend lower fidelity . changing . harbinger thing come , great thing u , hopefully , presage increase asp china . broad-based strength gpu market q4 good . yes . okay . great . think desktop share point ? feel like lot noise two quarter ago . seems like sorted . actually company pretty well gpus . yes , mean gpu market strong u , think . 58 % 66 % marketshare three year . consumer graphic whole . gaming ; 's oem well . would -- n't see changing much . one thing share number unit share number . dominated high-volume , low asp low gross margin percentage oem number . data point like data point , caution people look . quarter share gone revenue gone . revenue share gone . purely around fact someone gained load $ 12 , 25 % gross margin notebook chip low end . joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evenden joe moore yes , okay . notebook point ? mean , think always fairly healthy gaming notebook market . kind -- think bullish term whether characterize attach rate growth discretes notebook . 's sense long-term market ? 's pretty interesting market , actually , point -- got gaming notebook bag could show people , would pointless anyone listening internet . bring , actually , people room . see modern gaming notebook look like . taking . 's tiny . , three-quarters inch thick ? yes . n't understand strange ancient measurement country . mean pretty attractive device , right ? explains , think , growth notebook , get powerful gpus suﬃciently power eﬃcient fit new form factor . much attractive device . first device really coveted . great notebook . seeing maxwell . maxwell twice power eﬃcient previous generation . fermi already pretty power eﬃcient . maxwell doubled . see take u new market . right , gaming notebook grown strongly . used tiny part business . 'd say material sure . grew like 60 % year year . pretty interesting market u . okay . great . professional side guy one sort high profile loss mac pro , workstation ( multiple speaker ) . yes . n't workstation . geforce . chris evenden joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evenden joe moore thank . got categorized sort desktop part guy , right ? yes . mac pro , selling geforce . desktop . selling firepro . workstation , apparently . drive insane looking -- trying look oems trying analyze decision retrospect . win , lose . overall , share fairly constant . would expect move -- fact , seem move marketshare number . right . would 've thought -- . well guy fine , obviously . yes . would expected move marketshare number pretty significantly . obviously , lost workstation business workstation market got larger , new platform added . reasonably significant volume standard workstation . guess -- . marketshare n't seem changed nearly much expected . chris evenden joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evendenyes . guy sort dominant position quadro . line blur desktop quadro point ? well first time 've seen anything like 10 year market . first time 've seen major platform recategorized way . okay . sort -- price point margin profile quadro business sort ? yes . mean quadro still -- got great margin . yes . margin changed appreciably , think , many year . right . n't see major impact -- yes , many year . least long , n't even want think much . yes , margin changing . okay . great . part professional , tesla business . guy commented xeon phi first came going create lift business . think negative business . little skeptical claim . think lot people . think spot-on growth really good . seem like intel kind made category lot bigger presence . yes , think combination thing . love tesla business . tesla attractive . got 21 minute 29 second left could use talking tesla . think -- benefit everybody else , reason intel entering market actually positive u biggest obstacle selling tesla ( inaudible ) around using existing xeon cpu . competing tesla xeon cpu supercomputing . argument using tesla going little bit -- going port code massively parallel architecture . joe moore chris evendenyou going get much faster code going much power eﬃcient , matter data center limited amount power get amount heat wick . argument inertia . like , well , intel going come faster cpu soon enough code automatically get faster . wo n't anything . argument . intel come market said , well , actually , going run power wall move parallel architecture . got thing called xeon phi . use . way , main competitor agreeing u . becomes question want xeon phi want tesla . incumbent space . support far code ; many programmer know use u . much richer , deeper , broader ecosystem . feel pretty good space . intel clearly powerful competitor invest lot get market . win business . overall , market growing . think important element , probably key driver growth year , support sort critical mass , like , code numerical algorithm run tesla . broad-based distribution channel , effectively . year half ago , tesla team would go -- make sale , would go potential customer ; would evangelize whole concept gpu computing ; would help customer port code ; would finally make sale . , choosing hypothetical example , could drug researcher somewhere looking protein interaction , know numerical dynamic code accelerated tesla , know ibm carry tesla server . phone ibm salesman get machine delivered friday . n't even involved . used really high-touch business . zero touch case . able break level start growing seriously . another step function becomes lot bigger point , kind holding steady ? well think growing strongly . think grew 37 % year year last year . n't see reason would n't continue . said , consumer joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evendeninternet company pretty interesting new market u , big data analytics . talked bit last analyst day . think say future . netﬂix actually posted technical blog using gpus aﬃnity marketing , like , find movie might like based choice . oh , okay . machine learning . looking like could increasingly large application area . also application amongst consumer internet company higher , much higher volume application well . talking analyst day , way , march 25. month next analyst day san jose . looking forward . grid grid sort interesting concept still -- 's hard kind figure dollar come . clearly 00 interesting value proposition . tell u grid going turn revenue time ? sure . grid graphic . serving graphic power network . number way looking monetizing . example , actually gaming beta running northern california . main one looking right improving user experience citrix vmware . citrix vmware , n't familiar , software platform virtual desktop infrastructure . mean pc n't really running desk . actually running server somewhere . getting desk actually video stream server . instance window running server ; oﬃce running server . application . cpu obviously running window running oﬃce . actually compositing well putting together desktop , compress video stream , squirt network ; get . cpu good task . poor task , compositing compression . joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evendenso mean get user experience little bit outdated today 's expectation . mean 3d application n't supported . even modest 3d application like autodesk . autodesk installed base 7 million seat worldwide . run intel integrated really , really lightweight 3d . much virtual desktop infrastructure . putting gpus server , increase user experience everyone . also enabled support application . video well . video another thing virtual desktop infrastructure problem . make experience better . important citrix synergy last july , actually . ago . chatting var . telling biggest obstacle adoption virtual desktop infrastructure user resistance actually , department love . term security manageability , got data one place . keep eye . lose laptop plane , lost laptop . nothing proprietary , nothing . department love . try roll user , user experience get way implementation stall . boon u help vmware citrix well look towards . mean really interesting business . sell , sort -- work , 's functional ; 's customer ? well directly would sell server manufacturer . ibm say . yes . sell subsystem , right ? obviously , working var well train . obviously , working citrix vmware directly well ensure native support virtual gpu software environment . today hundred trial worldwide . increasing quite rapidly ; 40 % q-on-q actually . purchase cycle enterprise two year . six month . joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evendenso n't data yet help model term conversion rate trial , average deal size . data n't exist right . look really promising , lot trial , lot excitement . wait see land . yes . gaming side grid , mean lot streaming gaming service coming -- yes . -- playstation 4 streaming . n't really work yet . least streaming ps3 game , gaikai infrastructure bought . like start participate meaningfully online gaming grid business ? think little bit . -- like said , 6 , 7 person beta northern california . looking working towards . right , focus really virtual desktop infrastructure . okay . great . tegra , guy bit shift tegra incorporating kepler class graphic , really interesting . give -- make much differentiated space . also little bit unclear much revenue drive near-term . talk decision mean 2014 ? evangelization process , milestone look see evangelization playing ? yes . aligned roadmap . say got pc-class graphic mobile chip , fitting within mobile power envelope . still power eﬃcient a7 , example , s800 similar voltage level . outperform power level performance lower power level factor 1.5. pretty significantly better . obviously , really shine start cranking support pc feature like opengl , 4.4 , directx 11. even demonstrated we've ported unreal engine 4 across . big deal enables joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evendengame developer fairly easily port game across . game -- one industry figure game development -- remember last console cycle , name . asked -- time console launching , said , going best console , xbox 360 ps3 wii ? looked interviewer eye said , well , whatever sell unit . game developer , care installed base certain extent . really primary thing . always challenge getting game onto mobile installed base . great thing getting unreal engine 4 incremental cost transferring game across run unreal engine 4 tegra , already running unreal engine 4 ps4 , incremental cost tiny , small . change balance equation term installed base . hopefully , start kickstarting gaming android . vision android going huge ecosystem . going segment crystallize ecosystem . one segment gaming . would like incumbent crystallizes . launching tegra k1 part . porting unreal engine 4 tegra k1 part . actually , shield part . effort -- several hundred people work game developer . lot guy working building gaming ecosystem android well . part strategy . lag right -- nothing like -- rome n't built day . working towards . kind customer land product outside automotive , get second ? first customer tablet side kind capability ? would ? yes , type -- ? ca n't specific . joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evenden n't think could . really tegra k1 , 'll focused topmost part phone market , superphone like , high , high-end smartphone . tablet . premium tablet n't $ 499 . premium tablet $ 199 perhaps even $ 149 manage bom appropriately . think premium market . want decouple bit high-priced . 'd characterize . , obviously , ca n't name customer . okay . let stop see question . lot question n't . let 's see question audience . keep going . auto , guy . think analyst meeting year ago , kind buried presentation huge auto number . kind piqued curiosity . nobody really talked ( multiple speaker ) big could . blah , blah , blah , 2 billion . exactly . since , obviously , become major focus pretty big win last year . consumer electronics show . mean talk 's function tegra car right going go ? originally , started automotive business many year ago , actually , gpus , notebook gpus . would running nav dvd player . course , role electronics car become greater greater every year . navigation system getting sophisticated . 3d google map . audi google map , example . seeing digital cockpit well . future , going start seeing driver automation system well , advanced driver automation system , ada system -- sorry , driver assistance . volkswagen audi group big customer . bmw big customer . a3 , a4 , a6 , a8 , a7 . bmw i3 i8 357s well . probably even-numbered one , though n't stated explicitly . volkswagen golf . really attractive -- volkswagen golf , n't attractive car way . like marquee win like tesla . people sort associated u , tesla , model s. people associated . golf , a3 , -- 'm trying think whether mini . may . skoda , mainstream european make . european may familiar , probably le u . broad-based . seeing role graphic increase . example , drive massive 17-inch screen tesla . drive pixel , so-called digital cockpit . increasingly , seeing dial , physical dial needle , replaced pixel . one thing audi announcing ce next-generation digital cockpit , going based tegra 3. strong differentiator market quality pixel really n't matter . barcelona last week . cab older priuses . digital cockpit well . actually week , lucky enough drive friend 's tesla . digital cockpit . completely different user experience . would mistake quality tesla experience quality -- prius experience . think quality pixel , resolution , material , effect , look give , say almost much in-car -- quality car handstitched leather inlaid walnut fascia . another random story , couple year ago looking new car looked -- probably n't say since 'm actually mic . looked particular japanese manufacturer car . nice car . reasonably high-end car , great sound system , great leather chair ; probably nice leather chair today ; good engine , powerful , handled great . could n't get fact navigation system badly translated japanese . colored whole -- tainted whole experience car . brought home important effect in-car electronics user experience . crux visual computing , core differentiator , impact user experience . know talking bit topic . talk brieﬂy advanced driver automation system , tegra k1 come . tegra k1 programmability pc peer . got 192 programmable processor core . turn gpu good taking data turning image , gpu also good taking image turning data . context , image recognition tremendously important . shown demo tegra k1 taking video stream real-time recorded front car , car parking camera , like . know white line joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evendenare . recognizes white line road . know car lane . see car front recognize far away car . even read speed limit sign side road . fundamental building block advanced driver automation system people work towards . audi , ce , announced tegra k1 going chip behind ( facet ) call , -- call -- basically ada system piloting , self-piloting car . yes . 's pretty cool . good stuff . right , quickly expense , guy guess made comment various time r & kind fully invested . obviously spending fair amount r & . tegra , segment profitability , probably would like . without stealing thunder announcement couple week , thinking expense going forward ? different process evaluating project need spend money ? well obviously , analyst day place talk longer-term strategy , going year , thinking portfolio management thinking area double area cut . let 's talk quarter . quarter guided essentially ﬂat . 's -- historically , q1 automatically quarter fica tax . take effect . nothing , opex go q1 . fact guiding approximately ﬂat tell pretty strong control elsewhere business sort reduced thing , though think hit approximately ﬂat . okay . much -- think given number past much r & expense tegra . tegra , willing comment tegra , plus icera ; much r & dollar ? yes . said last analyst day incremental cost tegra development $ 300 million . including icera . taking strict look extra spend tegra . example , kepler , gpu , allocated . allocated tegra see k q . really truly , kepler anyway . going anyway geforce quadro business . joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evendenso extra , fraction actually required tegra ? arrive $ 300 million number . obviously , year ago . still pretty committed tegra , necessarily every facet every device . yes . absolutely . still believe level computing . still believe power visual computing , android particularly . clearly , got powerful franchise automotive . challenge build similarly powerful , profitable , defensible segment within android tablet segment . want give chance , , little bit concerned getting close end intel royalty . close 40 % gaap earnings , guess . run 2017. sort dcf pay multiple rest business . led u make incorrect negative call stock couple month ago . one worst call . still think kind ongoing issue wonder , like proper treatment intel royalty think royalty beyond end 2017 deal ? always diﬃcult predict legal -- thing depend legal outcome . almost like fda approval , following sort stock . way think intel royalty cover patent till end agreement , march 2017. correct say april 2017 , got nothing go . said , filing 500 1,000 patent year . situation start fix pretty much immediately . question , negotiating posture u intel time . depends large number factor . say cross-licensing deal giving someone recipe book clever gpu idea . agreement sue . thousand engineer working clever processer technology . thousand engineer working clever processer technology . inevitable point develop thing . maliciously , copying ; working space trying similar thing . scenario , n't want engineer constantly looking shoulder worrying guy done . joe moore chris evenden joe moore chris evendenso sign cross-licensing deal , general , money paid larger company smaller company larger company revenue risk patent litigation smaller company . come . modeling hard want net present value calculation . obvious thing put zero terminal value . n't know going go zero . might stay might restart couple year later . licensing opportunity . say . licensing opportunity well march 2017 come along . n't know terminal value . suspect zero . yes . right , good . thanks much , chris . thanks .
