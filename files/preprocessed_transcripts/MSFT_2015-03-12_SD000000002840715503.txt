okay , think ready get started . 's pleasure mike schutz microsoft today . going talk cloud azure . also zack moxcey ir u today . asked mention , begin , microsoft may make forward- looking statement presentation . refer sec filing risk factor related business . 's true whether person listening web . mike , hoping could get 101 tutorial azure . n't know lot azure . think 's around $ 900 million run rate business , two-thirds infrastructure-as-a-service , one-third platform-as-a- service . course , cloud business broadly , counted oﬃce 365 , think 's little $ 5 billion run rate business , would put world 's largest cloud vendor oﬃce 365 saas business . amazon much bigger infrastructure-as-a-service . platform-as-a-service , much competition . lot value add think get microsoft incumbency advantage . got million people write .net . got infrastructure . fact hybrid cloud strategy . user say , well , maybe put cloud , cloud . work together . could maybe get talk little bit azure , microsoft cloud . give u bit competitive assessment differentiation , would good place start . absolutely . first , want thank u . exciting first event . want really thank letting u participate . lot detail built lead-up said . think would good u parse go conversation . way introduction , run product marketing call cloud platform solution microsoft . includes private cloud solution around window server , hyper-v. system center virtualization management ; public cloud platform microsoft azure ; enterprise mobility solution . , 'd love touch -- base interrelated eye customer . talk thing . answer question term rough 101 respect azure , azure public cloud platform . provides infrastructure-as-a-service , platform-as-a-service , well number high-value service around . customer look u run application workload . also connect existing infrastructure premise cloud . able talk little bit . 's , high level , focusing helping customer embrace public cloud -- integrating existing investment premise . asked -- differentiation perspective look . really zoom back little bit focus provide complete cloud platform . mean want broadest set solution customer use premise providing consistent set technology customer build run application cloud , premise , combination , whether 's infrastructure-as-a- service platform-as-a-service . try connect cloud . provide set service provides connective tissue on-premises data center public cloud data center . within lie fundamental differentiation . 's three dimension . first around refer hyperscale . broadest set region worldwide public cloud provider , 19 region . way comparison , 's twice many aws . google 's cloud platform , 's 3 time google . put azure close customer . customer care . want cloud provider geography , region , multiple reason , data sovereignty standpoint , geopolitical reason . also practicality end-user experience standpoint . ca n't really change speed light . want proximity cloud service close customer ultimately customer . rick sherlund mike schutzin order , 've invested significantly building global infrastructure power cloud service . seen u last several year , increasing footprint region like australia , china . announced going india year . continuing grow global footprint customer provide global reach . local touch . 's one element . think hyperscale , couple vendor could invest scale global reach . really shrink consideration set customer lot traditional on-premises vendor wo n't n't invested public cloud scale . hyperscale lens , couple vendor . differentiation relates public cloud vendor , like aws , really around focus around enterprise grade hybrid . root deep selling working enterprise . global sale support organization . partner ecosystem hundred thousand partner sell support deploy solution . customer , particularly commercial space , want local touch local reach . , enterprise grade key differentiator u selling commercial segment , enterprise segment , nothing new u excited help transformation . hybrid standpoint , consistent solution across premise integrates really well help customer think data center one -- extension microsoft azure . vice versa . think asset inclusive run . what's running microsoft azure . technology help extend . right . mike , got three hour worth question , probably . exciting opportunity chat . compete aws , example , kind workload delivering perhaps distinct aws ? think 're infrastructure-as-a-service market . today large number customer start infrastructure-as-a-service . n't view destination . believe infrastructure-as-a-service great place start . 's easy customer get started understand , virtualization , concept taking virtual machine putting cloud running way . rick sherlund mike schutzone thing customer finding infrastructure-as-a-service 's great certain workload , still inherits complexity running virtualization premise . still manage operating system inside virtual machine forth . thinking platform-as-a- service , well moving hybrid cloud service -- example someone extend storage infrastructure premise cloud without necessarily move application -- hybrid cloud service , well thinking platform-as-a-service , area distinctly differentiate . amazon going start disclosing margin aws quarter . someone gartner said thought maybe much 60 % gross margin . stopped said , excuse , said 16 % ? said , , , 60 % . kind astounded keep seeing referred commodity business . enormous scale . guess 's possible , scale , could get kind margin . longer term , would seem platform-as-a-service , least everybody else , fatter margin going value add higher . managing infrastructure -- platform , aws . go platform-as-a-service vendor like microsoft , managing operating system , database , whole middleware stack , right . take lot complexity . test dev , use amazon . want run application n't really need infrastructure , aws enormous scale reach . incumbency advantage everyone already run microsoft oracle infrastructure ? inherent advantage get platform-as-a-service incumbency advantage might ? azure , know , really started platform-as-a-service . design point believed market would go long term . subsequently built infrastructure , service offering , meet customer today . certainly believe -- listening customer getting benefit moving platform-as-a-service . mentioned , 're moving complexity managing underlying part , see tremendous benefit particularly agility get -- development organization able respond business rapidly , microsoft taking managing underlying stack app instead operating system . rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlundfrom offering standpoint , believe mature offering platform- as-a-service . addition , mentioned term footprint developer today , million .net developer building application premise cloud every day million developer using visual studio tool set able build application . , 're much working customer focused heavily devops developer productivity platform-as-a-service brings . yes . heard say initially offered platform-as-a-service . market really wanted test dev kind work . wanted infrastructure-as-a- service . see evolving market might ready think using cloud handle lot workload kind outside test dev might better leverage strength ? definitely see organization think developing application cloud mind platform-as-a-service looking . example accuweather . accuweather 'll know one heavily used weather application service . given amount weather locally year , sure get quite bit use . thing 's interesting accuweather today azure . looked alternative market , including amazon , opted platform-as- a-service azure . today , process roughly 6 billion request per month weather temperature forecasting . originally started on-premises infrastructure . found usage app , course , follows weather pattern . got bad weather coming , spike extremely high . could n't -- trouble keeping scale building capacity able handle predict going happen . also wanted able go globally . provided global infrastructure scale demand let write le code manage le infrastructure scale demand customer . extremely powerful . used take month proof concept day . 's agility respond need feedback they're getting customer , 's tremendous . 's largely powered eﬃciency get cloud platform-as-a-service . mike schutz rick sherlundis market ready , think , build new thing azure going move existing thing ? going build new , would pick .net platform would say , well , google got interesting stuff ? pivotal . open source platform . -- best opportunity , guess . would think term competing web native modern programming standard ? great . think one thing -- way think azure , finding , incremental opportunity business , opposed replacing application server premise . 40 % azure revenue -- talked past , 40 % azure revenue come startup isvs . largely segment n't sold significantly past . focusing segment , well enabling existing customer sector enterprise able embrace cloud , present tremendous opportunity u . start-up area , organization .net shop use open source . done strike number partnership market take open approach embracing open source linux azure . one thing often surprise people 20 % instance apps run azure running linux . recently announced last year partnership docker container . 're supporting corel linux distribution standpoint , well number linux distribution azure . organization preference java node.js want build linux docker container , love . time , also helping .net -- million .net developer build modern cloud-based application using latest technology . mike , 's one interesting thing new management brought microsoft ability acknowledge open standard need embrace . n't feel necessarily good report earnings see , well , cannibalizing business . sort 's market going . hear really good thing silicon valley microsoft cloud . seems like azure product people respect think ability support open standard take people surprise 's history microsoft . mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlundbut guess degree supporting open standard , appeal incumbency advantage .net developer , ability -- n't know people going move workload cloud . ability compatible stuff work together . appeal -- scale advantage , able appeal new developer platform open standard based , would seem like building , architecting , address camp . yes . think 're building platform approach say want complete cloud platform run next generation application mobile first cloud first world , core strategy . shareholder standpoint , able monetize expand addressable market bringing linux azure . able think would monetize linux deployment past . looking partnership oracle , sap , salesforce able run application integrate azure even run azure -- non-microsoft database running azure , end day 's meeting customer . right . certainly believe first party application service quite competitive . end day customer decides would like run another platform , would love meet exactly . 's interesting see press release conference call 're working oracle ; 're working salesforce . cloud , really necessary , right , got integrate . got play well others platform . trying push platform exclusion thing customer need run , 's going suitable platform . 's interesting environment . data center . asked oracle , n't need data center ? argue , , , use colocation , lot saas industry us . competitor infrastructure paas well . mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlunddo need data center business n't really gotten meaningful scale yet 're okay using colocation . ultimately important scale advantage derives data center ? indicated earlier , important thing customer . therefore taking global scale approach important . ca n't colocation well ? look way get market different factor weigh -- may ; may . example joint venture china able bring azure china . main part make sure able bring technology customer . 's huge economy scale think global scale need deploy . work way . think look platform-as-a-service , see ultimate competitor business ? think microsoft azure early market paas , feel like 're good spot . definitely see google aws investing place . , non-cloud vendor investing platform-as-a-service . 's early day paas . 's going interesting see play . amazon , : invent conference vega november announced sql relational database . n't typically think -- much platform . give sql server , oracle database . run , right ? see coming platform trying broader platform-as-a-service vendor ? mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz ca n't really speak , obviously , aws going invest . believe investment term building platform-as-a-service layer inclusive data . hybrid cloud approach , continue differentiating market . hybrid point , really -- area different player market view customer existing investment want integrate look extend asset cloud , rather rip-and-replace model . look scale advantage , thought probably little $ 1 billion run rate business azure right . oﬃce 365 run data center . right , infrastructure ? one thing talk term complete cloud oﬃce 365 microsoft azure offering customer really important . area oﬃce 365 offered n't yet offer azure . definitely focus complete solution customer ( multiple speaker ) trying think scale advantage also got xbox live . got bing . got actually pretty big scale business think data center cloud business -- look say , well , 's around $ 1 billion business , probably underestimate scale opportunity -- leverage margin might . infrastructure perspective , property . operate 200-odd public cloud service , consumer commercial . 's global infrastructure operated team provide u learning build diverse platform run high transactional one side , maybe , high i/o . 's provides u great diversity application able learn build best platform customer want put application cloud , . also provide u economy scale come deploying really broad global infrastructure . rick sherlund mike schutz go market , everyone already running technology business , almost everybody . degree give hybrid cloud capability choose want run thing , anyone actually moving infrastructure , look , work , leave ? would seem ability integrate new stuff cloud infrastructure already run , would nice complement getting one vendor . absolutely , think 's whole approach offer hybrid cloud solution . -- customer think , maybe n't want run data center time . vast majority customer , azure incremental 're . instead provision infrastructure max capacity , black friday , provision average tuesday use azure peak capacity need . compatibility provide make really easy . another really interesting area azure able increase addressable market monetizing selling solution workload n't , like storage , example . hybrid cloud storage solution called storsimple . 's called azure storsimple basically plug customer's existing infrastructure . could vmware infrastructure , could hyper-v infrastructure . 's san . tier data microsoft azure backup , archival . replication . company -- example , paul smith uk , pretty well-known retailer , us storsimple bottomless storage repository ever-increasing storage need premise behind virtualized environment . model , 's almost like simplistically take picture phone , automatically copy cloud . 's model enterprise . connect cloud customer seamlessly end user n't know , n't worry . itf 's inclusive operate 's running cloud . storage one . never really able monetize storage past . yet 's area able think . another example azure incremental existing window server system center business premise . rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlund yes , think business growing 100 % year . amazon , obviously much bigger scale , probably around $ 5 billion revenue right . : invent event , said growing 40 % year . kind surprised last year think 70 % expectation maybe could 100 % year started really gain traction . google came market little year ago -- year ago , guess , price cut , pretty hard price cut , 50 % , surprising amazon immediately matched pricing customer going let google set price market . going ? pricing always going fixed percentage cost 're passing benefit consumer make really hard n't biggest scale really get margin business ? think couple different dimension think . one core service like compute , networking . storage infrastructure-as-a-service . , economy scale hyperscale cloud provider provide provide opportunity give back customer vendor scale . think , though , seeing time price conversation 're customer changing . looking value they're looking premium service deliver . talked -- recently 60 % customer using -- azure customer using higher value service . 's key way drive premium -- premium value shareholder also offering value customer . thing like paas enterprise mobility suite per-user entitlement customer secure mobile infrastructure provide identity management . , ability u meet customer pricing perspective look market dynamic . also continue upsell customer premium service key ( multiple speaker ) could customer n't care price ; everyone , right , market . market pretty eﬃcient pricing storage compute . mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz also realization 's typically customer may start . build around really want look complete solution build around . looking additional service left right helpful . 's running vm cloud gigabyte storage cheap price ; 's value get . 's much infrastructure-as-a-service good business microsoft ; 's lead potentially much higher-margin premium service , like platform-as-a-service . 's right . okay . 'm going skip one topic open . enterprise mobile management , intune , know get oﬃce 365 , e3 version , enterprise version , think get low-end version intune 's thrown . managing desktop laptop , particularly window 10 perhaps coming , also get intune part console manage mobile device well . 's historically n't really thought customer would trust microsoft manage android phone apple phone . satya onboard , seems making friend . play well others . sort wondering maybe microsoft n't big opportunity going forward play well others manage mobile platform ? think , zoom bit , two fundamental secular trend place . one around mobility bring device . u using device multiple form factor , smartphones tablet . may bought device . addition , enterprise buying type device , . mobility absolutely clearly secular trend . one saas application . addition needing work connect application provided organization inside company , saas apps . whether salesforce oﬃce 365 , crm , box , concur , workday , , user bringing cloud . therefore intersection cloud-based saas application mobility present real challenge security perspective helping end user productive anywhere . rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutzthe enterprise mobility suite built , combination mobile device management mobile application management 's powered intune name service , data protection encrypting file microsoft rms . , last , identity management , user management providing single sign-on saas application . providing control get able control access apps , one run prem . cloud , multilayered approach taken enterprise mobility suite . 's fantastic companion oﬃce 365. go-to-market perspective , oﬃce 365 enterprise mobility suite many way become way organization help user productive device want , using best productivity apps . help secure application data , well making sure user access information , single solution . apple ship new version o , available day zero supporting apple product . got relationship . trust conveying detail new o . able support right away ? google android io set apis mobile app mobile device management vendor use . absolutely able work provide right level capability release product . relationship google good apple term support get ? work company equally well . would say relative emm vendor , n't see competitive disadvantage microsoft trying support platform . . great success intune matured year able expand offering android io . rick sherlund mike schutz rick sherlund mike schutz window 10 , implication window 10 term managing mobile device ? think strength bring bear respect mobility trend enterprise mobility fact system center configuration manager , pc management product , highly deployed enterprise . estimate two every three pc managed system center . system center intune , able provide single solution manage device , whether pc , tablet , phone ﬂavor , one console . really resonates think silo device . think manage . extends window 10. continue manage window corporate network really well . window 10 also managed mobile device using mbm . able provide solution across pc , well form factor . great . starting feel little guilty hogging . n't open investor question ? investor little bit shy . probably grab . term breach seen , high-profile breach . thinking security cloud , sure must one first question every saas company every cloud vendor address term security . reason believe security worse better move company might scale advantage managing security ? think scale certainly provides u ability see malicious activity act . one thing talk customer lot view -- lot trust . term vendor believe customer look cloud , security element , privacy element . compliance element . security standpoint , focused providing underlying security platform . also tool organization encryption key , example , like access data . offering service call key vault , customer bring key rick sherlund mike schutzwe n't access key . actually help ensure data encrypted manage key . one example security capability providing . another one user authentication layer . got within azure active directory , , core part enterprise mobility suite , technology provide anomalous user behavior detection . think credit card company identifies fraudulent activity -- credit card , identity theft different variety . user name password theft , got somebody might impersonating trying log enterprise . use machine learning capability identify user trying authenticate two location delta would n't able get time would n't -- would physically impossible . block access . require two-factor authentication additional security . , security big element . 're also focused privacy . may seen recently received iso 27018 , really high standard privacy , well standard eu around eu model clause well . privacy important . , focus lot compliance certification customer need , depending industry 're geography 're . , three element really helping dialogue customer , especially enterprise customer , think moving cloud . mike , 're time . zack . thanks much microsoft u today . thanks much .
