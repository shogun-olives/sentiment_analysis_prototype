good morning , everyone . 'm mark murphy , software analyst j.p. morgan . i'm pleased hosting corey sander , cvp microsoft solution . corey , thank joining u . thank . question answer got . 'm going kick handful plus question , also take question audience . -- audience , would clicking q & button bottom screen , type question , relay corey . corey , welcome . mean lot u . 're going discus many key growth vector microsoft , would love start background cover role microsoft . absolutely . yeah . thanks , mark , thanks . lot fun . i've microsoft 16 year . started actually intern , developer window . started fixing bug window core part platform five year . moved azure 2009 product team designed virtual service , virtual machine , actually wrote first spec virtual machine azure , sort -- 100-page spec sort would work customer ' experience around , ended q - mark murphy - corey sander q - mark murphy - corey sandersrunning compute team actually , many year back azure . year half year ago , moved current team , called microsoft solution team . one thing realized azure really enjoying going working customer trying get done , problem solving , digital transformation learning industry scenario . moved role get lot closer make full-time job . 'm responsible sale customer enablement across commercial solution area , 've got ai , apps infra -- business apps , includes , course , dynamic power apps power automate , modern work , team m365 , et cetera , security , sort spanning across , course . 's gig . okay . pretty good idea retrospect , azure compute engine invented 2009 , think , 's pretty good job got . yeah . thank overview . want ask sale organization , corey . seen microsoft sale engine firing cylinder quite time , robust booking growth , fact , since reorg year back . since oversee commercial solution seller organization , maybe explain u unique structure group , organized , maybe touch work rest company , sale evolved microsoft last couple year . yes , absolutely . 's evolved continuing get focus , even coming fiscal year . key area . one , think deep technical expertise call sort technical intensity inside company , making sure seller knowledge , expertise , depth product customer would use start finish across entire process . something 's -- 's ongoing journey product constantly changing expanding growing , making sure sort latest greatest information deep sale folk . 's really important . 's something really focused hard last year , actually , came azure , one technically challenging area , sort depth networking security compute past service , making sure seller could really conversation in-depth customer . 's big area focus u . q - mark murphy - corey sandersit lead right sort customer success conversation . one big thing changed continually focused making sure seller actually compensated customer using successful technology . 's longer sort sell license move conversation . make sure actually leveraging . span solution area . span power apps , span team , span , obviously , azure making sure 're actually using big part story one motion . 've also given lot industry focus . something actually really expanded even going fy '21 . think 're seeing even greater focus industry , something , especially covid-19 crisis , need give industry focus quite high every industry thing little bit different way , digital transformation n't mean thing every industry . retail going different manufacturing , going different health public sector , et cetera . focus really important . mean skilling mean understanding industry depth . maybe couple final point . continuing expand digital selling . 's kind obvious thing , especially , sort able sell remotely . something think already journey , covid- 19 , , actually accelerated lot focus . thank goodness , amazing tool help u . partnership conversation . continually focus partner making sure 're lined success end-to-end motion . , corey , sale team applied learning expertise , successfully realm digital transformation , 's become enormous topic . 've ( inaudible ) multi-year strategic deal . 've seen walmart . 've seen & . 've seen kroger . 've seen others . earnings call , heard satya actually called two year digital transformation happened past two month . 've taken many question . mean ? walk u -- mean customer perspective ? investor think statement ? also wanted ask , topic , inning digital transformation , u global ? pandemic impacting deployment ? large budget discussion ? sorry , 's four question one . four question . let -- 'll go piece-by-piece . yeah , first question around sort two-year data transformation past two month . one thing important step digital transformation sort passion energy excitement top company making shift . either deciding 're going become much remote workforce , 're going leverage remote- based solution . also opportunity productivity improvement automation , able take digital service manufacturing plant , using iot able smarter approach thing running many year whether need repair . big set digital transformation push leadership 's right thing need . think progress seeing , typically -- hard conversation . take work . 's -- typically , 's cost involved , sort think workforce need change get . think shift covid-19 , 've seen lot conversation dramatically accelerate . 's suddenly become goodness , right , new world , either financial perspective remote perspective , need happen immediately , right . think shift , really sort paved way accelerated conversation . 's also accelerated customer already underway , right ? already sort seeing go said , need move little bit faster . actually think sort mean sort 're thinking , especially post-covid world , 's sort multiple phase covid-19 challenge , recovery going see lot digital transformation . obvious short-term business continuity . seeing sort uptake sort remote-based experience service solution . obvious one , team seen sort huge spike , window virtual desktop , seen huge spike . perhaps le obvious one , e-commerce solution curbside pickup , kind interesting one , remote assist used hololens . sort support people factory repair thing without someone looking shoulder , remote safe location . even thing like remote sale really picked obvious reason , people still need make sale able take advantage . next sort wave -- certainly , 'll see hybrid period recovery part remote , part back oﬃce sort enabling solution automation . real exciting place 're seeing sort energy around digital transformation sort really accelerate sort structural change thing 've already mentioned , automated factory , smart building , able understand oﬃce , , able fraud detection able take solution 've got digital twin really apply longer-term change . going happen overnight , right , much would love happen two month , 're going take work go deliver . going back maybe -- think covered everything except last question , sort stage , -- sort impacted deployment large-budget discussion . stage ? 're early stage . think sort important point . think sort customer deciding want . clearly , 's sort early stage promotion . think 's huge amount opportunity 're going continue see growth around . q - mark murphy - corey sandersand short-term conversation , think 've seen lot give take come deployment large budget discussion . energy . sometimes , desire give whole lot upfront money part , may strong . enable longer-term growth opportunity perhaps reducing short-term expectation customer across massive digital transformation motion . think got , mark , missed , please bring back . 's great depth perspective . 's good reminder area overlook time . e-commerce , curbside pickup , 're always mindful . also said something along line , god , need immediately . know satya talked concept remote everything earnings call . walk u going mean customer perspective , near-term looking longer- term horizon ? yeah , absolutely . 's place 've seen immediate impact remote everything . certain -- obvious one , team sort usage team , sort realization 's -- must set type environment able continue either teamwork learning , 's sort obvious one . actually , window virtual desktop sort fast exciting growth area . , similar reason , need able work secure remote way . security also really important concept part remote everything . n't -- necessarily elicit concept something remote , lot structure security solution like azure active directory , conditional access , enables work remote way still secure based whatever policy principle on-premises . think big one really short-term twitch -- short-twitch -- excuse , near-term fast-twitch solution . one longer-term -- fundamental change way folk work . think best example maybe sort digital sale customer service able sale motion fully remote definitely challenging folk . think 's new experience able tool solution similar customer service , right , sort , many case expectation people on-site point , limitation -- make harder . 's service like remote assist become much easier leverage . one interesting thing 'll say , 're seeing , interest customer taking advantage remote capability , they're actually learning benefit remote . something think shocked people , even talk internally sort sale force -- q - mark murphy - corey sandersan in-person sale force actually disadvantage remote sale force future . intelligence brought . solution like customer insight dynamic , actually bring live intelligence part remote selling understand customer going ask , thinking , pitch , right , come right screen enables live way . similar customer service , enabling virtual agent . , using ai intelligence really take customer service , improve , reduce cost increase stat . longer-term conversation , actually think interesting 're little bit work . 're going take little bit effort customer side . value much greater , remote . 's actually adding incremental value top , thanks ai intelligence layered . , corey , want come back five minute . want drill dynamic 're interested topic . want ask well spend consolidation potential recession . look back think microsoft played offense extremely well economic expansion . view eventually , 'll point budget come pressure recession , maybe customer trying reassess value 're getting premium-priced alternative 've using . well-positioned think microsoft going convey higher roi , kind cohesive architecture versus point [ ph ] product ? 'm thinking market , could span everything collaboration , communication , security , file sharing , area . think behave economic period ? absolutely , yeah . common conversation 're customer . 'm sure understand appreciate . really tco conversation 're , think 's going set interesting impact different place business . certainly , m365 -- microsoft 365 actually well-positioned great tco conversation . around typically vendor consolidation discussion , right , able say , seven different security solution three different compliance solution . customer -- think met customer said 43 distinct security solution using . shocked could keep track . opportunity take subset solution , consolidate leverage sort single solution single price , tco really quite powerful . common conversation 're across board , certainly opportunity u . similarly team , right ? certainly , team really expansive platform . 's chat , collaboration , meeting , voice , application hosting platform , , becomes opportunity consolidation , right , instead one platform 's really good meeting one platform 's really good q - mark murphy - corey sander q - mark murphy - corey sander q - mark murphycollaboration chat , one maybe application platform , suddenly , bring together . , think 're really well-positioned type solution . think azure going interesting one think azure also really valuable tco conversation . think actually short-term , sort , negative impact actually , revenue , transparently . think 're going see customer ' opportunity able reduce spend , actually , we're passionate helping . 've built checklist seller go say , way got customer reduce spend , removing workload , rightsizing vms , making sure 're using right size paying right price , making sure 're scaling versus static usage like used on-prem . using cost saving option , reserved instance , 're actually making sure seller pushing sort much cheaper ability buy computer pas service . , area think actually really powerful tco conversation customer . think short-term headwind u , transparently , longer-term opportunity build trust sort prove value prop much precisely customer think tco . okay . would -- 're right thing customer relationship long-term . part 's going helping get eﬃcient use area , including actual azure ( inaudible ) usage ? fair way think ? [ ph ] 's right . think place vendor consolidation single product give cost saving , think way helping even product usage , reducing way 're using get . think 's right , yeah . okay . , corey , want come right back team interested . okay . wanted ask well , going back last earnings call , amy commented seeing weakness smb market . 're wondering -- think trend digital transformation spend discussion , ask - corey sander q - mark murphy - corey sandersyou , think 's going play customer segment environment ? yeah . one biggest partitioning 've looked -- sort impact actually industry , right ? think actually industry segmentation shown lot distinction sort impact playing . sort -- 're leveraging little bit gartner list sort high-impact , medium- impact , low-impact , caveat , education , think 's high impact . education actually positive growth area u . , think -- opportunity even . look high-risk industry , across enterprise smb , 're going see challenge . think existing workload see cost reduction effort looked , may see slowdown new workload . -- think going impact . think smb likely going see higher amount impact nature business little bit le fungible , sort little bit le expendable cash , et cetera . think 'll see industry slice happen think 'll see impact greater , smaller business lot obvious reason . , course , countered fact 're actually seeing massive amount growth area , right ? interesting -- retail kind interesting one 've seen massive growth retail place established online presence obvious reason . struggling online presence , 've seen le usage . 's little bit even give take within industry . good amount industry 've seen healthy growth , public sector , education , retail , et cetera , think helping . way , 's helping driving growth enterprise smb alike . helpful , logical , obviously , one quite global scale reach microsoft look across slice . mention , wanted come back team . went back looked quote actually recent survey work . , let -- want read two . team basically zoom slack together . make argument zoom slack standalone better , team all-in-one .
