's 've seen u thing connect , gesture . seen u thing voice , one coming . thing come together . first tablet , could say . technology n't actually make mobile thing would carry around . idea tablet , able take note , take , stuck 5-pound luggable . 's sleek , thin little piece . element come together . believe come input model user experience inﬂection point hardware , device 'm really excited job . apps io ecosystem ? overcome ? enable new kind app . successful creating curated set application took people trying web made valuable device . created model get paid get thing . q - unidentified participant - julie larson-greenthere another one coming , belief . already start see . think connecting apps , many thing special-purpose , start see new way apps integrate across . think lot 's going come web smart information -- location . sensor going become big part think thing . thing talking , see fitness device people wear wrist interesting thing . 's extension ? sensor thing build help daily life ? telling n't quite push-up far really thought could go ; letting know 's time take -- heart rate high must stressed . take big , deep breath -- letting know bus running late bus stop -- bus running late . 's lot thing bringing thing together new way thinking people interact technology . n't think -- mouse invention , touch invention , next new way interact . 's focusing natural user interface -- working . could come bit back surface ? could said launch dual track last year , rt window 8 , somewhat confusing supply chain consumer . think 's still viable route dual track continue done refresh year ? actually think need proper reboot rt , start ? guess answering question , exactly rt achieved , standpoint ? sure . window rt -- think clearly -- look industry , clearly need simplified consumer electronics experience device . look ipad particular 's turnkey , closed system . n't degrade time , n't get virus . 's ﬂexible . ca n't much . 's seamless experience , even though simplified . window anything want . write way metal . add thing startup group affect battery life long-term . q - unidentified participant - julie larson-greenthere cool powerful scenario . come cost mobility . window arm , window rt , first go creating closed turnkey experience . n't ﬂexibility window . power oﬃce new style application . could give kid 's going load bunch toolbars accidentally , internet explorer . come later , saying getting pop-up ? n't capable , design . goal deliver two kind experience market : full power window pc simplicity tablet experience also productive . goal . may enough -- think n't explain super well . think differentiate device super well . looked similar , using similar . n't everything expected window . 's lot talk , rebranding ? called window ? made differentiated ? think time see u continue differentiate . window phone o , window rt . full window . going three . think world mobile operating system n't risk battery life risk security . also come cost ﬂexibility . believe vision direction continuing path . started presentation used quote , unquote one microsoft . that's new concept , right ? know every division p & l . 's diﬃcult . seems like ego . work together one microsoft , quote , unquote , believe guy capability thing want . 'm sure long would take get break wall collaborate one microsoft . tell thought would ? sure . part coming strategy . 've talking long time -- ran window organization , job really get group inside microsoft bet platform . q - brent thill - julie larson-greenwe bing build apps u . xbox team build music video . became default music video experience window . oﬃce building one note new experience . 's completely foreign u , kind work cross-group . incentive worked -- different ship cycle , different p & l goal . mal-intent , busy thing . busy one thing . busy bringing together experience customer microsoft level . operationalized completely different way . working together plan . team going working -- shared vision , shared roadmap . individual team going working cross-team scenario . meet weekly , slt leadership team checkpoint want go . challenge . product leadership offsite working cross-company scenario . 's new u . really ca n't -- say going one microsoft divide different functional team . actually put ecosystem , thing place make real ; new line communication , new line accountability , new line -- new way decision-making . . julie , thank much joining u . time . thank . thank .
