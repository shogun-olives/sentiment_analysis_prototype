good morning welcome bloomberg intelligence webinar , focused regulatory intellectual property trend semiconductor industry . name anand srinivasan cover industry firm . call expert analyst anti-trust matter , jennifer rie ; intellectual property analyst , matthew larson . bios research work found bloomberg terminal typing bi semi go . let 's get started . housekeeping note . today 's presentation recorded available playback . bottom slide window notice adjust volume maximize screen . recommend maximize screen best quality . feel free ask question q & panel right slide . address question conclusion presentation . copy slide distributed via email following presentation , additional question sent bievents @ bloomberg.net . bloomberg intelligence , familiar , provides unique analysis context industry , company government litigation , economic , credit factor affect business , integrated within bloomberg professional service . cover roughly 130 plus industry 4,000 company globally . 're team 200 plus people , located new york , london , hong kong , singapore ; senior analyst average 20 plus year buy sell-side experience . , 're broker dealer , n't provide buy , sell , hold recommendation , industry company context . specifically semiconductor industry , terminal user explore bloomberg intelligence analysis pressing industry theme , company issue , well jennifer rieregulatory ip trend , typing bi semi g. also idc data semiconductor data semi , industry trade body , dashboard . thought talk company thick anti-trust and/or litigation matter undergoing significant intellectual property issue , company qualcomm , nvidia , marvell , micron ; also talk little bit ip theme , regulatory trend going industry , also talk offensive versus defensive patent . thought 'd start samsung . one thing done extensive work effect samsung qualcomm . company qualcomm . choosing make in-house chip versus buying qualcomm 's integrated baseband , obviously qualcomm lost samsung handset potential . additional factor ; one , samsung's balance tip towards lower end handset share loss towards higher end handset , asp also get skewed downward heightened competition industry mediatek well . 've discussed length dashboard part qualcomm deck . would urge investor people interested qualcomm go bi semi . 's also consideration part strategic review try split company two . explicitly suggested would create weaker segment long run , perhaps best interest company long run . however , near-term , segment might attract attention multiple suitor . 's backdrop qualcomm , recently settled ndrc china , would permit licensing segment potentially cross-license gain revenue stream handset royalty make -- handset maker china use qualcomm non-qualcomm chip . 's background qualcomm . , jen , 'll start . paint picture u , investigation qualcomm underway across different regulatory agency . current status timing , potential fine action outcome ? mentioned eu specifically could levy largest sign . 's right . thank , anand . well , yes , qualcomm investigation actually quite year , across world competition authority europe , korea , japan u . recently concluded investigation china related way license standard essential patent , 's pretty much finished . , investigation intrusive , 're distraction , end day , really see one potentially kind real impact company would europe -- european commission . let 's talk 's going first . , european commission done recently sort formalized investigation two different kind anti-trust conduct . first one older investigation 's kind lagging , 's around year . started customer complaint related chipsets comply 3g standard mobile phone . 's alleged qualcomm predatory pricing chipsets . mean price chipsets marginal cost order capture sale , competitor ca n't price low without driving business , concept sort garner monopoly down-the-road raise price recoup whatever 've lost pricing cost . n't see really turning much anything , first , kind claim diﬃcult prove anti-trust enforcer really n't want discourage low pricing . 's little bit conﬂict goal anti-trust , also law predatory pricing bit unsettled europe european commission n't tend fine area law unsettled . second kind conduct looking maybe little bit serious situation . looking allegation exclusive dealing sale chipsets comply 3g 4g standard used mobile device . exclusive dealing ? u , call de facto exclusive dealing . , offering extreme financial incentive , rebate , discount condition customer purchase chipset requirement qualcomm customer really choice . 's worth stop buying competitor , , hinders rival ' ability compete . reason think serious ; first , law exclusive dealing europe clear set , 's precedent , 's presumed kind conduct -- investigation show going -- harmful conduct . fact , good example intel fined 2009 , similar allegation similar kind conduct related cpu . time fined eur1.06 billion conduct requirement well . could see , thing bear qualcomm violated law , similar kind fine could assessed qualcomm . , talking timing though , nothing going resolve time soon . thing lag year - european commission statutory deadline . n't see anything happening le year probably . thing think 'd like clarify often see news european commission fine 10 % annual turnover company . really rarely ever happens unlikely happen . happens , pick percentage 5 % 30 % sale product wrong directed . look severity antitrust defense . case exclusive dealing considered sort le severe side antitrust conduct . 'd probably looking something 10 % . intel 's case , took 5 % . multiply percentage sale number year anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasanwrongdoing ongoing , basically 's fine . fine increased company repeat offender ; company 's involvement limited , decreased . , see potential fine . , n't see occurring way road . respect korea japan , really n't see lot impact . korea also looking abuse sep . seems 're hearing korea somewhat satisfied imposed china term change qualcomm ... royalty qualcomm would charge ... n't really look like much going come . also u , see u looking whether 's abuse licensing standard essential patent . looking -- ftc -- looking conduct section 5 federal trade commission act . usually use section 5 think conduct , sort , le egregious end anti-trust conduct . section 5 rarely ever end fine . usually end cease desist order , simply saying , hey , reasonable way license . really that's slap wrist anything else . basically , fall `` no-big- deal '' category . summarize ; korea big deal , japan big deal , u itc big deal . ftc . u ftc big deal . watch big fine , potentially , timeline still , unclear ? right , 's exactly right . okay . , want shift gear talk little bit ndrc . qualcomm settle ndrc , clear way chip utilized chinese handset maker potentially pay royalty revenue , 're still discussion make license agreement . let 's say -- also potential change business practice , also broader impact industry . matt , talk little bit ndrc 's settlement intellectual property perspective ? provide framework company stay cross hair ? matt larson yeah , certainly . ndrc settlement interesting couple different way . certainly provides roadmap -- company like qualcomm looking license standard essential patent china . standard essential patent , patent cover various technical standard . wireless communication , wi-fi , kind interoperability issue may , company decide standard used across industry . one device work talk another . intellectual property required implement technical standard referred standard essential . , concern -- general concern , much company able strangle market owning technology everyone us every device . ndrc settlement , set term company , specifically qualcomm , license standard essential patent . three main provision think telling . first potentially impactful people license chinese intellectual property turn required pay people take license whatever patent return . cross-licensing , almost obligatory cross-licensing agreement party paying license offset price intellectual property depending size two patent portfolio , could large offset , could small offset , 's little bit protectionist measure bring rate company intellectual property china . second point think important royalty base . way patent licensed based percentage rate device , component , royalty base . ndrc settlement said royalty base apply licensing percentage 65 % end device . previously company would license , let 's say , wi-fi technology 2 % 3 % entire handset 3g , 4g lte patent would licensed anywhere 1 % 3 % end device . china said , longer use entire end device royalty base , 65 % . 're reducing potentially royalty payment model , 's quite extreme position 've seen jurisdiction . example , united state , couple area people moving end device royalty base smallest component practice technology royalty base . 're moving entire phone wi-fi chip , thing like . actually somewhat neutral guide post ndrc settlement . third point think worth raising standard essential patent licensing qualcomm-ndrc settlement fact company longer allowed bundle standard essential patent non-essential , 'll call `` cadillac '' patent licensing deal . 've got anand srinivasan matt larsontechnology cover wi-fi standard . license separately bell whistle patent portfolio . company previously lumping together generating premium licensing entire portfolio . ndrc settlement put end practice , requiring unbundled . depending look , could drive price 're able charge non-essential patent 're looking attract licenser . 's going change licensing dynamic negotiation dynamic people looking get return chinese intellectual property . seems like disaggregation intellectual property seems mo ndrc . philosophical difference intellectual property body across different jurisdiction operate china 's different ? mean , would dramatically saying , mean , ieee thing ongoing , `` okay , pay wi-fi chip , percentage phone , pay wi-fi chip ought worth . '' right . , ndrc appears similar tact well . question , dramatic difference china versus u versus eu intellectual property , china-specific , ndrc-specific thing ? . think , 's good segue larger discussion . policy , specifically , 're seeing disaggregation couple different front . see delineation u contractual requirement company undertake respect standard essential patent license reasonable non-discriminatory term . , 'll license term 'll negotiate separate term , 'll call , catalog patent . china ndrc interacted letting company large standard essential patent portfolio , bully company taking license non- essential feature . 's little bit protectionist approach . whereas u , 's kind -- kind built system way license negotiated . looking generally , trend play , remember china introduction intellectual property strict enforcement recognition intellectual property developing area law china , bulk patent protection introduced globalization economy come , 's developing area contrast u , intellectual property baked constitution , holding private property anand srinivasan jennifer rierights ability monetize always central factor u government u market , whereas china getting speed . read somewhere someone called china 's patent system vibrant yet ﬂawed system . think 's good -- 's good description , 're getting speed , still issue . cultural perspective , united state always focused protection monetization personal property , think approach china focused individual barrier protection . , see play negotiation way intellectual property enforced licensed . , regulatory perspective , jen , purview different agency dramatic difference regulatory agency united state eu view versus china ? 're starting get lot regulatory agency involved ndrc , mofcom . certain factor also used judge whether certain industry company risk regulatory interest ? last question add pile , fine matter , changing practice , ip structural risk ? well , think , like matt explained development ip enforcement , we're exact place development antitrust enforcement china . anti-monopoly law went effect 2008 ; 's really new . entire anti-trust regulatory regime new developing , called basically wild card . mean , new decision , 's something new occurs , 's new approach . anti-trust regulator study carefully see history develops . think understanding , compare eu u competition law long-standing , well-developed , backed load economic analysis , basically , generally meant protection healthy competitive market . word , geared toward protecting company competitor , geared toward keeping healthy competitive market everybody chance challenge incumbent compete robustly . maybe little bit different approach far chinese enforcer . concern enforcement largely protect domestic firm , 's protectionist foreign competition . 've even seen concern expressed federal trade commission chair people , well representative doj stating concerned way anti-trust implemented china matter industrial policy rather protecting competition . , continue see develops . we're viewing approach might taken , expect industrial area chinese anti-trust enforcer going looking , robust domestic industry . 's bit anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasan matt larsonwhat 've seen , 've seen active tech , software , electronics , auto part think might occur going forward . term fine , changing practice ip structural risk , think depends jurisdiction . see jurisdiction willing dole big fine , including europe case u . think see jurisdiction like china might interested changing practice , controlling ip , controlling royalty rate thing like , really wo n't see ; wo n't price regulation occurring antitrust regulator u eu , 's really practice ; whereas look like chinese regulator willing price regulate talk royalty need certain type patent . seems like mo chinese regulatory agency protect china inc versus keep china inc versus non-china inc versus purview eu , u regulatory agency may protect consumer `` big bad corporation '' . reasonable description ? , look today , yes . mean , 're still seeing thing develop china 's lot discussion cooperation amongst agency -- 's lot assistance development regime , least , yes . okay . matt , want switch gear talk little bit offensive versus defensive patent . 've done little bit work subject . become common practice tech sector , n't ? gathering ip defensive purpose simply sword nothing else annoyance suit , may , versus serious product development effort ? yeah , 's right . number different way company utilize intellectual property , specifically patent protection . 're seeing lot creativity innovation space well . think , offensive versus defensive distinction good one , commonly referred industry , using patent sword shield . traditionally think patent , think think defensively . shield . get patent product came , intent purpose excluding competition using technology . came secret sauce , want use product , want anybody else use misappropriate , want reap benefit able sell much widget . 's kind traditional defensive portfolio , 's company invest r & , 'll anand srinivasan matt larsoninventors submit disclosure lawyer , protect stuff 's getting incorporated product . 's strong defensive portfolio . side , company starting look massive investment , r & , also pay annuity keep patent portfolio , maintenance fee . question investor start , 's roi 're getting asset 's sitting . 's property right like anything else , license . 's start get using patent offensively using sword , either looking others industry might benefit technology , maybe license stale intellectual property n't using , somebody else might able monetize . company n't focus certain market sub-segments . competitor using technology might able monetize ? always option selling part portfolio either getting kind license back company acquires patent , sort selling one-time fee . lot different creative arrangement company gotten order generate kind return patent portfolio property asset . like sword shield analogy . 've talked theme -- theme little bit , 've talked qualcomm little bit detail . let 's jump marvell . company predominantly hard disk drive controller space also ﬂedgling mobile chip business , specifically focused integrated baseband application processor chip . le 2 % market share qualcomm mediatek space , 3 , 3.5g side 4g side , intellectual property caught cross hair litigation , carnegie mellon , supposedly carnegie mellon huge $ 1.5 billion case marvell , back active little bit . tell u little bit thing stand timeline dollar impact going ? certainly , kind high level overview overall case early 2000s marvell looking design improvement implemented medium noise processor le improves ability detect medium hard drive detect information . 's kind need know technology , really , 's something developed part professor carnegie mellon . long story short , carnegie mellon went marvell patent infringement suit , wound steamrolling marvell trial . post-trial , additional damage tacked . dust settled , marvell looking $ 1.5 billion verdict judgment . marvell obviously n't pay , opportunity appeal question finding district anand srinivasan matt larsoncourt made , jury implemented try pick judgment apart little bit . one -- couple ground looking , jury awarded damage based $ 0.50 per chip royalty . basically looked last 10 year marvell chip , found average chip revenue $ 4.40 per chip , found profit $ 2.16 gave $ 0.50 per chip , 's quarter profit . 's good , $ 0.50 royalty moving forward get dangerous price chip drop , eats profit margin . percentage , 's hard $ 0.50 . 's diﬃcult part judgment , one upheld appeal . appeal court say , `` yes , correct royalty , 're still hook $ 0.50 , '' marvell able save large portion verdict , said large portion chip supposed pay royalty never enter u . 're manufactured abroad , 're sold abroad , they're incorporated chip , incorporated product abroad , never entered u , 're subject u patent protection . issue , appeal court said 's enough evidence presented first trial , 're going scratch 900 million approximately half verdict send back court proceeding . marvell looking $ 278 million verdict potential add additional damage district court proceeding , 're also looking $ 0.50 royalty moving forward . , think 've got situation party way far apart settle trial . marvell going pay 1.5 billion . 're ballpark couple hundred million . carnegie mellon n't business putting marvell street . want continuing royalty , want generate revenue intellectual property . , think place could potentially see deal company lot closer . interesting part -- part sent back ip entity bearing stuff made overseas part jurisdiction sold overseas . u company , would ( inaudible ) saying , make product overseas , 're sold overseas , u intellectual property patent somebody take , make overseas sell overseas , wo n't able enforce . fair characterization ? 's fair character notion extra territoriality u patent protects u law . question far contact foreign jurisdiction really escape long arm law , speak . anand srinivasan matt larsonand , 's -- 's interesting question case , 's close call , carnegie mellon presented argument design occurred , 's basically everything happened u shipped design overseas , chip subject royalty . marvell disagrees patent well action actually occurred u entitles royalty product . , 'll see battle one playing . 's interesting question , guess party frequently n't litigation , 's interesting lawyer . 's interesting everyone , chinese handset maker qualcomm said , whether could escape u intellectual property , 're making china selling china , maybe would subject . interesting bit . nvidia , another company -- bloomberg intelligence coverage company , 've done detailed amount work , claiming undergo serious transformation pc graphic company pc gaming company transformation -- transformation make gamer le pc company . result , pc weakness impact bill , announced earnings tonight , 'll get little bit detail whether trend continuing . aside , company litigation samsung , qualcomm , arm , imagination involved . , lay case u , timeline event , monies involved . yes . , high level , look charge screen , let click , 's . 'll notice nvidia focused mobile space right , segment 're putting lot energy , go ahead click-through . , going back concept using patent portfolio sword looking see generate additional revenue patent portfolio . one option company taking look technology protected seeing 's space 're operating seeing generate royalty people operating space . 's le exactly nvidia done 've taken look samsung us graphic technology nvidia 's major competitor . 've got samsung sourcing graphic qualcomm , arm imagination . nvidia going samsung galaxy device similar device able generate revenue three graphic competitor area 're operating . anand srinivasan jennifer rieso approached samsung , licensing negotiation broke , , usually happens company reached standstill , litigation ensued . going fairly aggressively looking resolve dispute pretty short timeline based litigation filed . 've filed fast jurisdiction really quick time trial . look case timeline , 's screen , 'll notice one trial already happened , another one way . 's jury trial coming 2016 judgment issued . feeling case samsung nvidia want reach deal , 're trying check scale favor one person . right , samsung couple key victory , trial already held , seem favor samsung although long way go kind final judgment verdict rendered case . looking timeline , considering nvidia samsung key representative meeting next couple week discus settlement , may possible could resolve dispute end year , trial start kicking final decision . looking nvidia 's overall strategy well , 've got $ 1.5 billion license intel 's going dry 2017. , indication nvidia want get deal samsung done time negotiate intel , kind based part royalty rate provision license . 's exactly analogous technology , company negotiate ip , get prior license industry practice . think 's important nvidia try get good deal end 2016. think good goal deal 1 billion probably paid typical license four seven year . samsung continues win get good posturing litigation , could see come based leverage value case . got . want talk little bit micron minute . reported interest tsinghua university 's asset management arm , end-market breakdown micron , dram nand leader , 's consolidating industry . jen , lead u u issue anti-trust perspective regulatory body perspective ? sure , course . unlikely significant antitrust issue , insignificant competitive overlap , least enough competitive overlap company , create issue anti-trust regulator . think sometimes see statement 's anti-trust problem , 's really getting confused may issue u , front committee foreign investment united state , often called cfius . anand srinivasan matt larson anand srinivasancfius executive branch organization charged identifying potential national security risk posed foreign acquisition u business . committee chaired secretary treasury includes representative number different u department agency including defense , state , commerce department department homeland security . charged determining whether foreign acquisition investment pose security threat , process n't particularly clear cut . cfius review micron transaction seems likely . reason transaction involves acquirer state-owned entity , transaction automatically subject increase scrutiny , usually mean longer-term scrutiny . mean cfius , would go full scrutiny , 30 day plus 45 day 75-day review . happen deal blocked due national security reason could lot mitigation measure put place deal allowed go . oftentimes , deal n't usually blocked , oftentimes happen mitigation measure , include significant u oversight ultimate merged entity , mitigation measure pretty extreme diﬃcult acceptable buyer happens deal get abandoned . 's possibility , certainly get cfius review . got . matt , ip issue ? mean , little surprising micron reasonable ip portfolio commodity industry perhaps 's . talk little bit ip positioning perhaps deserves cfius review . yeah . think one attractive thing micron patent portfolio . 've got pretty sizable chunk asset u , shy 19,000 u patent . portfolio actually one cited portfolio semiconductor space . seeing company referencing micron patent filing patent . 've also got 4,000 international patent interesting arrangement company currently monetizing patent micron sold . couple year ago , sold 4,000 u patent company called round rock research , engaged fairly large licensing campaign , file 37 lawsuit patent acquired . -- micron also executed licensing agreement large patent portfolio , round one . 've really got pretty strong network intellectual property asset could leveraged potential buyer . got . thank . 're getting end sort discussion , may . one question . jen , pylon effect regulatory viewing particular company , one regulator one region look qualcomm . know , time reached jennifer rie anand srinivasan matt larson anand srinivasansettlement , four regulatory agency started looking . fair , right ? ? well , might think fair . mean , think 's couple factor weigh . first , increasingly global economy 're talking chip , really global product ; 're talking emerging market - they're becoming active anti-trust enforcer , 's increased need international cooperation . , 're seeing , think actually end day good thing , lot international cooperation amongst world 's antitrust enforcer . particular , korean ftc attacked lot importance international cooperation ; 've entered memorandum understanding 15 competition authority . see u , eu chinese regulator talking lot ; 're sharing knowledge . happens 're interested protecting consumer country . talk 's happening different investigation , learn 're going look whether could effect conduct within jurisdiction . end day , knowledge- sharing cooperation 's currently occurring might good thing long run business , anti-trust enforcement agency come together become aligned way treat antitrust business conduct , certainty comfort business actually operating globally conduct whether may may violate law . , ; pile-on effect n't good , also good thing . slightly different differing agenda ip perspective . 's right . think similarity . one reason seeing similar issue , company similar intellectual property asset different jurisdiction . file patent u , 's key patent , seek protection globally . meanwhile , patent law vary slightly jurisdiction jurisdiction , generally similar approach . jen pointed , country apt get involved rate-setting actual term agreement -- whereas others little bit hand party differ court system actually get detail nailed . 're seeing little bit variability difference patent law approach resolve dispute . matt larson anand srinivasan jennifer rie anand srinivasangot . thank , matt . folk , , 're end standardized presentation . , reminder . want ask question , use q & panel right slide . pause moment look q & . matt , 're , talk amd quick minute two , patent portfolio , positioning , thought amd . yeah , certainly . , amd pretty interesting portfolio . right , 's sitting 5,000 patent , think , little bit fewer 5,000 patent another 1,200 1,500 pipe . lot amd 's patent activity happened right around 2000s , 's kind 1997 2002 era , somewhat stagnant since , big portion electric digital data , maybe another 20 % semiconductor . seems pretty unique portfolio 've able monetize fairly successfully . 2010 samsung paid $ 283 million payment essentially settle dispute . entered royalty-bearing cross-license intel . part overall litigation strategy , intel wound paying amd sizable chunk dropping lawsuit , although 's explicitly royalty , would imagine large portion attributable intellectual property . , amd kind developed , mean , small sizable strong patent portfolio able monetize fairly successfully . got . jen , given lot & interest chinese state-owned entity late desire build semiconductor food chain homeland . explain cfius get involved versus agency regional clearance might required ? well , cfius going get involved time , non-us entity acquiring u asset . , n't always review , going step going take look . think warrant review , review impose mitigation measure . 're always going involved 's essentially non-us entity acquiring investing u asset . far region , going depend whether test triggered . say , different jurisdiction sort framework transaction filed antitrust authority authority given chance review , usually reach certain threshold ; certain size certain amount asset within country certain amount sale country . , depends product question sold . matt larson anand srinivasan matt larson jennifer riegot . matt , since 're talking semi , review intel apple sort portfolio really quickly give u skinny two ? yeah , certainly . , apple taking interesting approach , mean , 've got large investment intellectual property . 've got lot patent , fashion big innovator certainly done lot innovation . today , nobody disputing . apple , term monetizing portfolio , take interesting approach , 're frequently target intellectual property lawsuit . n't like using pejorative , patent troll go apple , want quick payday . , apple le concerned monetizing patent offensive sword way using shield . apple taken lot effort reduce royalty payment . 're talking standard essential patent , apple take position royalty lower , based smaller percentage device smallest component possible , higher royalty dig pocket . apple huge innovator , 's also made lot step adverse say qualcomm ericsson nokia , company really looking monetize innovation . got . 's recent passing law `` ip troll '' . help industry regard make worse licensors owner ip ? think 's yet seen , 're still kicking around provision bill going . 've got good team bloomberg intelligence actually following kind recent activity surrounding bill . 's going tough anytime adjust patent litigation system , winner loser . really kind depends final bill going look like . think 's little ambitious think 'll able pas litigation bill , law lawyer control litigation . seems suspect 's really going deter whole lot business practice . 'll see actual legislation come . yeah . also wanted raise 're talking lot ip tech , wanted raise something else . federal trade commission cover lot different industry area antitrust sort move ... different time focus move ... focused lot recently healthcare industry . event april anti-trust enforcer world ftc enforcer speaking panel , one thing said moving looking standard essential patent 're making priority . matt larson anand srinivasanand think , tell u company owns license standard essential patent , 's going kind come looking glass u ftc going forward next couple year . made really clear . something 're focusing . yeah , something 're focusing , 're seeing lot court case , lot company rather negotiating kind behind closed door , 're going court saying , `` alright , want know reasonable royalty '' , 're willing fight , 're seeing -- big dispute apple ericsson focus issue . ericsson tcl , lot -- 's kind emerging area low . think party looking court side ﬂesh really see chip falling . got . last call question wrap . okay . want take time thank jennifer rie , senior litigation analyst bloomberg intelligence ; matthew larson , tech sector litigation analyst covering intellectual property bloomberg intelligence . reminder , today 's presentation recorded , available playback , copy slide distributed via email . , bloomberg intelligence , one-stop shop semiconductor industry research . thank much joining u today .
