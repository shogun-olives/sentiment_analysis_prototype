right , well , room got little bit quiet . think live . good morning , everybody . 'm brad zelnick deutsche bank software team . welcome db tech conference . , delighted everybody room online 's listening . session , truly delighted welcome none microsoft 's evp security , mr.charlie bell . charlie , thank much u . oh , 's great . nice setting . learned 're sunny irvine , california . yes , grew , know whole area . 's kind nice get back -- smoke sunshine . well , 're glad . thank much , really looking learn lot microsoft strategy security . thank much joining u . n't mind -- maybe silence . 's important , may want take . always take call mom , even call 'm . charlie bell brad zelnick charlie bell q - brad zelnick - charlie bell mom . okay . would take call . question answer ( question answer ) maybe n't mind , n't know , could take minute explain role microsoft mandate actually ? sure . well , maybe best way kind wind clock back first started thinking something new amazon . amazon 22 year , n't know . january '21 , jeff bezos said , going step away . thought , thought , wow , going different world . could keep 'm . 'm good time . 're building cloud . thought thought , 'm going something new , moment . age , thought , get thing deeply . ca n't year thing . thought , well , 'm going something new , really analyze , think , either stick 'm something else . thing got right away something 'd seen year customer cloud computing , growth problem security . really bothered n't see end sight . actually getting far worse . whole shared responsibility model . diﬃcult customer . thought lot . thought , grew . funny talking wife , 's , way , brilliant woman . look someday . said , `` know , talk satya nadella . '' said , `` ? '' said , '' , talk satya . microsoft lot security . 's great company . '' moment , said , okay , fine . within week two , knew satya , way , 's old story back early 2000s satya q - brad zelnicksatya . tried recruit amazon , course , trying recruit -- met amazon . one senior leader . called redmond saturday talking satya . thing impressed first , n't know , 'd already formed microsoft call customer solution area around security saw problem . talked -- way , n't try sell . n't recruited . n't trying push , `` hey , charlie , ought join microsoft . '' listening asking question answering question . mostly interested thinking security . result conversation , talked two major engineering leader . rajesh shah run productivity user side business ; scott guthrie , run azure cloud side business . really great conversation . -- realized lot thing . realized one , engineering company . microsoft really inventing lot . also thoughtful scale . -- course , security problem , thought security problem , realized 's one , company really going solve issue going provider see many thing provider . knew running cloud . see customer currently using thing , problem . see 're going , 're , issue . much attracted fact microsoft , really 'd say , three pillar -- addition security business , three pillar service cloud 're going read problem . one providing infrastructure cloud . that's really important . end user productivity world bad actor start people . 's one -- 're weak link . course identity business microsoft move world zero trust , know 're talking , 're talking . microsoft far away largest capability area . yes , talked satya , came two year ago . formed csa , n't done taking product , engineering product scott rajesh united one organization . brought thing together mandate thing security . way , also read ( inaudible ) , ciso report . protecting microsoft . internal security microsoft well . 's lot first-party equal third-party , 's lot learning go . microsoft ground zero attacker , learn lot . yes , 's mandate . excellent , thank much . 've touched bit next question , 'll still ask . mean , momentum recent year security - charlie bell q - brad zelnick - charlie bellbeen nothing short impressive . high level , start giving u sense overarching strategy couple key thing think really differentiates microsoft security context highly , highly competitive , even noisy market ? yes . well , like said , one thing thought carefully breadth scale problem . mean , one thing realize , problem getting smaller , 's getting larger . estimate take , negative drain world 's economy bad actor represent gone $ 6 trillion , think 's estimated $ 10 trillion 2025 , 's growing faster indian economy , , think , top 20 gdp , 's fastest growing economy . problem getting diﬃcult need solve end-to-end offering . 've got cover full spectrum attacker work , start end user , 'll dish somebody , compromise account , 'll use whatever privilege person lever somebody real privilege person , use move laterally environment . 'll use piece , 'll use network , identity , e-mail , productivity application , main application , infrastructure , use . end-to-end really thinking going solve problem focus area . think world moving direction . 've seen ciso survey 's pretty radical shift thinking , going back like 10 year , generally piece together solution getting best breed , literally hundred different solution read security problem they're going consolidation , 're trying figure get end-to-end . attacker find seam thing , 's part 's driving . make sense . charlie , think december microsoft disclosed security $ 20 billion plus business time , growing north 30 % year-over- year versus broader security market , think growing somewhere teen . obviously , backdrop become bit challenging since . talk 've seen term customer demand ability take share environment , mean clearly consolidation play 's quite unique ? yes . well , think 're one major beneficiary consolidation move . see healthy growth . 're million organization protected , number grew 26 % last year . really interesting number customer using four workload , number gone 33 % . 's intensity , increase intensity , think , 's going . think lot optimization people , typically see happen short period time . long period time , way think q - brad zelnick - charlie bell q - brad zelnick - charlie bellabout said like , 're going $ 10 trillion drag gdp , that's going grow . 've seen estimate say could pas u.s. economy 's gdp 2030s n't get ahead . , , signal demand . think 's going lot need security product going forward . 's strong signal , n't seem abating . 's story year . maybe , think 2021 , satya announced plan invest $ 20 billion security 2026. obviously , 's , , player credibly make kind statement wherewithal . talk r & prioritization criterion use , generative ai might impact composition perhaps even level overall investment going forward ? yes . well , one reason came microsoft . looked asset microsoft leadership , satya 's propensity bring bear security . first thing -- 're going turn corner , first component data . talk asymmetry attacker , attacker come point defend entire perimeter . asymmetry favor , 's data . get see entire environment . one beauty cloud provider n't get see one environment , get see lot environment . 's data asymmetry work advantage . 65 trillion signal day processed within product . fact data , think huge advantage . bringing bear investment 're making super important . 've brought together -- industry like take product break cute four-letter acronym , everything sase , xdr -- siem , soar . siem , soar , yes , 'd like break . 's -- way , think fragmented world 've , 's certainly natural want talk -- name fragment talk . 've basically blurred line thing like siem xdr soar , thing , really , 're going end-to-end , 've got blur line , start data . 's lot investment , way , 's prerequisite probably biggest change 're going see security , one 's going q - brad zelnick - charlie bell q - brad zelnickto finally , think , turn corner . big part -- data world , ca n't see , act , use , n't matter , n't able far . 's one challenge security industry siloing expertise . think , company know network security , company know e-mail security , maybe something identity , endpoint . company expertise , want branch expertise , fundamentally , got able get across , , 's ai . 've got able take data , signal , understand . expert soc development organization building proactive defense , nobody really understand . ai ca n't . ai , call shift right , -- good responding attack . ai move fast see across whole bunch variable take action . proactive sense , ai look broad environment lot different technology understand across need done . , , way , thinking came . one thing saw astounded old job github copilot . amazing thinking , obviously , kind thing . amazing good . really dug , realized partnership microsoft openai , go way back . 's r & partnership , understanding microsoft llm technology could , pretty clear lot security . 's really opened door . think , 's even gone faster thought . saw gpt-4 could core building ai capability , thing think get u around corner finally asymmetry defender . mean , 're using ai well , right ? beauty , n't data . get see whole environment . get go -- still go thing , get see -- way , get aggregate everything . , think -- finally advantage ai . maybe lead next question , back theme 've touched , consolidation , feel like , promise industry . newcomer stumble upon problem domain naturally would say , okay , -- customer want make stop , 're swimming - charlie bell q - brad zelnick - charlie bellthese point product , 's always -- cybersecurity always arm race , consolidation along promise . think consolidation finally happening ? give confidence history fragmentation 've seen pocket consolidation , next-gen firewall , endpoint player done , 's still vendor rsa show ﬂoor every year easily count , help buck certainty 's always quite time ? well , 's like many thing . idea something happen , look technology 's mature enough , finally reach point get technological maturity . 's came provider , look capability microsoft data , like able process huge amount data , 're talking 65 trillion signal day . sure . talk massive input data come customer 're building unique environment , 've got able process huge amount data , 've got able real time , finally ability . handle huge volume , petabyte scale log coming , ability issue query across , able real time respond , messaging system , lot cloud technology really begun enable . think one ai side . think fact bring ai bear look across signal silo , . mean , 've always seat . 've talked long time zero trust . well , aggregator zero trust microsoft 's conditional access . saw side . identity system . basically went whole kind maturation . protected password , figured needed mfa . needed multi-factor authentication . needed something else said , yeah , 'm charlie . trust . thing started get intercepted . need ai look across infrastructure say , `` well , i'm looking end user variable . 'm looking system variable . 'm looking ip address , system 're , identifier . think 're charlie . 're charlie , 're going . '' 's lot capability built year . 's kind technology work , tend layer thing . think finally enough technology . q - brad zelnick - charlie belland also think , go back satya , understanding kind fundamental human progress technology . one reason wanted , share view , , 're technology company , win people confidently move forward . adopt new technology . like what's going ai right , genai ? 've got able use . tremendous thing , feel safely . 'm afraid 'm seeing bad thing happen , n't want use . wo n't buy . security , go way back bill , like around 2001 2002 trusted computing memo . microsoft figured really n't business people n't feel confident moving forward . think 're spot 's everybody 's interest , 's microsoft's interest , 're going continue invest make easy people . move background , security default . eventually , really get hump , guy wo n't even talking . one day . 's trust . resonates quite bit . go back march , several month ago , response microsoft proclaimed world , thing 're talking , trillion loss economy , shortage talent really understand cyber , fragmentation customer forced deal . answer security copilot , believe combine capability gpt-4 proprietary microsoft security model . remind u product , maybe feedback 're getting preview , even potential monetization structure , milestone looking investor going forward progress security copilot ? well , first , n't , chatgpt looking vulnerability kind telling . like -- order security side , hopefully , maybe guy played microsoft 365 's ability summarize e-mail something . security side , 've got -- get lot technical analysis signal , looking log coming machine . think , kind little different application generative ai . 's -- often say security team sport . well , within ai world , building copilot team sport . 's llm , 's specially trained model . example , one thing llm able query data . well , going ? well , separate capability know . 's system problem . exciting , came microsoft -- well , two year ago . end august '21 . getting started llm security . look thing across board stitch together , 've got able go , data , signal , got able let customer bring signal , done safely . one challenge think ai space , start systematizing large language model , , oh gosh , thing going looking lot data , protect data 'm accessing ? make sure customer take stuff customer able see something , get model way ? guaranteed separation . thing , got make sure model manipulated . one challenge large language model operate prompt , people manipulate answer going thing . 's lot -- lot red teaming , understanding base model separate model combination system , going behave . 's actually taken quite . 's long journey u . 's something think part r & development gpt-4 given u lot understanding problem go solve , also let u work openai kind thing done level , also capability . way 'd say , 's journey . 've got private preview customer . 're working . think first reaction customer 're astounded , like fact able thing tell , 's problem , 's stop right , think 's reaction first time saw capability producing . change security forever . 's -- 's fundamentally new way thing . 's also pretty , 'll call r & resource intensive . said , 's taking chatgpt saying , summarize e-mail . 's really whole bunch thing 've got go system level make thing work . 's back forth u core team model microsoft openai , 're long journey . 's going -- 're going begin introducing thing customer , think little broadly later year , 'll roll . think , far monetization , thing say , 's going -- 's lot investment part . 's lot gpus go spend . way , thing security model , guy go web start playing chatgpt bing start going back forth , well , time , 're inference . security model , lot inference . like order system level job , q - brad zelnick - charlie bell q - brad zelnick - charlie bellresource intensive . going -- 's going separate important business microsoft . maybe , topic monetization , balance interest direct monetization versus indirect monetization creating trust therefore better sell rest security portfolio azure oﬃce copilot everything else ? mean , microsoft know amy 's going let spend money spending gpus without return , 's big picture , right ? . , one reason excited working provider 's ﬂywheel paid security business free security business . provider going provide security default embedded -- bunch stuff -- continually launch kind new thing window example . 've done tremendous number thing identity offering , entra , come , -- customer get . part business give customer confidence move forward product . indirect monetization , interest provider make sure people safe get go . 's ﬂywheel learn , get build top , get find unique need customer say , bank , example , severe regulatory requirement segmentation duty . , okay , 're going need special functionality able . analogy use , 've got car , everybody buy car , buy snow tire car . 're going buy extra stuff need . 's always going monetization incredibly important area , think , thing provide part product well . 's helpful context . want respectful time 's much talk , charlie , broad topic , maybe pivoting another acronym . think big news couple month ago . microsoft announced entry sase market microsoft entra . area feel really win think microsoft 's value prop get away securing window core microsoft 365 apps azure service ? well , first , want say , one part conversation satya got microsoft , probing understand , protecting q - brad zelnick - charlie bellmicrosoft product ? think securing thing ? back head , thought , one thing 've observed , ca n't say 's cloud cloud . 's going multi-cloud world . people going use many thing . 's historically , go look technology . everybody 's always used polygon technology . nothing else , get acquisition 've using long time , 'll adopt new one . thing resonated protecting everything . ding , ding , ding , 's end-to-end . 's become end-to-end . say , look , n't care whether 's -- , launched security world microsoft , protect aws , protect gcp , protect people 's technology . 're committed whole end-to-end idea . think sase , maybe 's best kind wind back little bit really think zero trust really mean ? zero trust , n't trust anything . like , system , moment system start default trust something say , yeah , 're okay , without checking , well , 's entry point . n't network . like , 've often talked zero trust like kind networking thing . well , zero trust broad concept . 've core , conditional access entra . ability , said , take whole bunch variable , network variable , lot mark , say ai perspective , access . , access . ability , natural extension , thing announced entra , think idea 're going end-to-end , we've got able thing customer . tell u . n't u saying , hey , think ought go . customer saying , hey , guy really need giving u capability . got . make sense . look back five year , metric think know 've successful ? security-related objective measure microsoft 's business unit held accountable ? mean , remember many year ago , arrived , heard , actually related azure ad , metric many business measured . one many criterias objective many identity bring azure ad ? 's multi-year horizon , know really crushed ? achieved goal , think measuring ? well , mean , think revenue good one mean customer see value 're . 's sort obvious one . 're really proud q - brad zelnick - charlie bell q - brad zelnick - charlie bellcrossing $ 20 billion mark , kind big milestone . actually , one thing would make super happy stopped talking gdp loss bigger u.s. economy 2030s , like suddenly whole trajectory changing , look '25 , say , hey , maybe $ 10 trillion loss n't come true see tilt trajectory . would really big milestone , think , u . yes , mean , 'll continue number organization protected . track kind detailed metric protected user everything else , yes , would say big one 've changed trajectory growth what's happening . cool . charlie , time . anything n't get wished asked want impress upon folk ? mean , work 're obviously incredibly important microsoft 's success , important world . final thought ? well , sometimes talk kind loss , guy see headline time , want everybody optimistic . one thing got really love idea human progress technology . apply technology new problem , get solve new problem . think 're going able . think , key asymmetry talked , fact 're going able aggregate across large volume data using ai , 're going able turn corner thing . , yes , mean , look , look nation state , russia's attack china 's attack , north korea iran , whole unit spends lot time area understanding adversary . kind depressing sometimes . think , look , n't think human nature going change . think 's going bad people , continue thing . think industry going pretty healthy . would n't want anybody think , oh , gosh , 've got run hill hide . think 're making real progress , 'm excited . cool . well , 're counting . charlie , thank much deutsche bank tech conference . really , really great . thanks . q - brad zelnick cheer .
