's highest revenue car u.s. best-in-class performance . 's actually best-selling car revenue -- including high- volume car like toyota camry honda accord . dollar sale -- yes , think people n't aware . 're fourth best-selling number . highest selling revenue past year , car u.s. 's remarkable electric vehicle best-selling , highest revenue car country . think 10 year ago , nobody would believed . thanks hard work tesla team , -- result . 's great . said , class , model 3 outselling mercedes c-class , bmw 3 series , audi a4 , s4 lexus combined . 's unit . difference higher dollar . also energy eﬃcient car world . epa mile per kilowatt hour . see model 3 around 4. range right . n't want pick e-tron . 's -- 's room improvement . ( foreign language ) speak french , 's quite funny . new model 370-mile range . go -- actually motor trend . drove nonstop bay area l.a. admittedly , downhill sort -- really . feel downhill . 's . single charge go bay area l.a. pretty wild car especially full-sized sedan . new model x range 325 mile despite large suv . 's worth noting car exceeded -- electric car exceeded range first model came 2012. -- yes , resisting temptation pick competitor . . -- 's still -- 's testament tesla engineering team able made car seven year ago still exceeded range . car 's 370 mile steady improvement likely occur next year . long 400-mile range car . yes . get question lot . 's -- want clear , demand problem , okay ? absolutely none . sale -- far exceeded production . production 's pretty good . 're actually well . decent shot record quarter every level . , 's going close . we've got shot record quarter . 90 % order coming nonreservation holder . new customer . model 3 market potential see trade-in , 63 % trade-in nonpremium car , mean people trading buy model 3. yes , 12 % midsized sedan , 25 % premium vehicle . 's interesting supermajority essentially car traded nonpremium . 's -- lot potential . people look -- people look total cost ownership , actual total cost ownership , electricity much cheaper gasoline maintenance cost much le , n't need oil change filter change . basically never need change brake pad regenerative braking . actual operating cost electric car much le gasoline car . take -- educate people easiest thing look lease price purchase price . -- factoring fuel maintenance , -- 's actually -- buying model 3 like buying camry accord better , yes , better cost standpoint , yes . 's great car . 's car designed fun . keep putting gem like fart app . course , 's one favorite . 's like perhaps finest work . autonomy investor day , think well received . tesla full self-driving computer literally 20x faster -- 21x faster nvidia system replaces . expect feature complete autonomy end year . 'll still need supervise autonomy . able go garage parking space work without intervention . 'll obviously put billion mile testing . think probably sometime next year , able car autonomous without supervision . sometime thereafter , 'll able convince regulator autonomy safe enough car could actually go around one . 's really critical element billion mile testing , ultimately ten billion mile . huge ﬂeet , powerful ai inference engine . 's tesla full self-driving computer sensor car necessary car drive , like would camera direction , radar , ultrasonics , good imu , gps , kind thing . think 've laid groundwork ﬂeet essentially every car made since october '16 capable full autonomy , view , replacement computer alone . need switch computer . think lot people puzzled could say 1 million robotaxis end next year . 's -- sum vehicle made since october '16 essentially switch computer one made full self- driving computer month ago , -- 1 million car capable self-driving . 'll still need regulatory approval . capability . massively increase value car . fact , think 's basically financially insane buy anything except electric car upgradable autonomy . 's nut . see one country another putting date banning gasoline diesel car . environmental pressure move away fossil fuel getting stronger stronger . 's basically mad buy fossil fuel car point long-term resale value le le . 's also important buy car upgradable least full self-driving car self-driving also worth much . i've made comment . like , essentially , buy gasoline car 's full self-driving , 's like riding horse using ﬂip phone . 'm like , hello , wise . 's really -- take u bit time educate consumer . think people starting get . like car major investment people . 's often valuable asset . 're going make choice valuable asset , want look towards future say , headed ? clearly , 're headed jeffrey b. straubel elon r. musk jeffrey b. straubeltowards electrification . clearly , 're headed towards autonomy . 's kind car want get . think -- people starting realize . model , -- biggest segment vehicle world . 's midsized suv . 's 2.5x bigger model 3 market . think probably demand model greater , 3 x combined . put lot effort eﬃciency car , getting incredibly lower drag coeﬃcient . think might able get drag coeﬃcient actually lower 3 , -- quite unusual . car lot room inside . 's think like good sense design good design principle car look bigger -- feel bigger inside look outside , good design . car actually quite big inside . expect hit volume production towards end next year . internally , 're aiming sooner . want margin timing . yes . still find crazy gigafactory . used rock , rock bush . remember -- 's j.b. drew ? hi , guy . actually , guy want come join second ? yes ? yes . yes , think 'd good maybe talk gigafactory . remember like calculation battery capacity 're like , need battery earth currently producing . 's -- unless build thing , 's going happen . yes , mean , maybe tell story ... sure . well good see everyone . hello . -- yes , pretty crazy story . elon talking recently . 's sort amazing really simple kind napkin math could lead kind outrageous result . mean said , basically quick math looked , okay , 're going build 100,000 car per year many kilowatt hour per car therefore , therefore , 35 gigawatt hour cell per year . well 's huge number . actually entire world producing application , cell phone , computer , car , everything , year . kind shocked u said , wow , -- n't going work unless build entire new facility solve . yes . probably get battery factory world . therefore , better build . yes , mean crazy thing basically , think , 5 slide . showed picture factory hill said investor , need money build thing . gave u money , cool . built . elon r. musk jeffrey b. straubel elon r. musk yes , yes . built . , right . 's really giant . 's getting bigger . 're -- 35 gigawatt hour capacity potential giga right . 're sort 70 % 80 % capacity realized . think bit confusion earlier year panasonic said 35. 's technically yes . 35 max capacity yet . , probably , n't know , end year next -- early next . ... 's also lowest cost per kilowatt hour . 's half global ev battery production . add ev -- electric vehicle world , battery use , 's approximately equal make gigafactory . maybe quick shout whole team team that's made happen . mean 's epic project . mean said , starting dirt , literally dirt desert , biggest battery factory world . took thousand thousand people . kevin huge part , sitting . yes , 's pretty amazing watching happen . feel super proud part team . yes . -- 're making good progress gigafactory shanghai . 've watched progress online , get followed excruciating detail . think number drone ﬂying factory pretty nutty . need air traﬃc control . -- shell building basically done point . 's -- think might -- 's fastest large factory construction 've ever seen . maybe 's something faster . 'm aware amazing . 're already installing lot factory equipment , stamping machine . 'll begin installing paint shop factory module line , kind thing . obviously extremely important future china largest electric car market world . date , pay import duty . quite significant one , ranging 15 % 40 % , -- access local incentive make car china . local incentive going away think approximately factory start . think coincidence . least cost import duty . -- cost le make car china . 'll able affordable car china market . extremely important tesla 's future . gigafactory europe , see , 've made great progress . put picture like literally 5 minute ago . deep planning . actual place . generic picture europe . jeffrey b. straubel elon r. musk drew baglino elon r. musk drew baglino elon r. musk people going try reverse engineer exactly picture . 'm sure 'll figured . beautiful scene . yes , lovely . put factory . think may near hamburg something . 're still looking right place put gigafactory europe . hopefully , 'll make decision towards end year . also make sense car factory least continent . wise move . 'll continue expand , think , activity u.s .. pay tariff really long delivery chain high transport cost make car lot affordable people europe china . yes , 're looking forward making decision , hopefully , towards end year . tesla energy , 're looking probably least doubling energy storage growth powerwall powerpack compared 2018. internally , bigger goal . think least double . least sort order 2 , maybe approaching 3 gigawatt hour . 're installing solar roof 8 state . 're complete version 3 solar roof . actually quite hard technology problem integrated solar panel -- solar cell roof tile look good last 30 year . like roof last long time . -- 's -- amount testing one accelerated life testing say predict -- perform spend six month testing project 30 year . 's quite hard problem making easy install , getting cost low . 'm really excited version 3 solar roof . 's -- 'm really confident . think -- shot equal ( comp ) shingle roof plus someone 's utility cost maybe lower . 's like one cheapest roof available . potentially great roof better economics normal , fairly cheap roof utility bill . drew baglino elon r. musk drew baglino elon r. musk drew baglino jeffrey b. straubel elon r. musk jeffrey b. straubel drew baglinoso like basically better product lower price , -- obviously take like crazy . -- hard problem solve . like many company tried solve problem 've executed . think feel pretty good . guy want say anything ? would say team super motivated goal . think achieve . -- mean laser focused achieving . yes . actually , drew , 've number meeting drew . bang table . damn , 've got achieve . done . done . intention , intelligence invention . make happen . maybe actually introduce drew properly . sorry , kind forgot . drew -- 14th year tesla . drew exactly stranger . drew joined team tiny , tiny team . like 5 10 u something couple year company got started . 's trying , n't know , right-hand person , involved almost every key initiative i've done company whole tenure . think 're super amazing . agree . think guy see drew . 've involved lot stuff still leading lot key initiative u . anyway , introduction drew . jeffrey b. straubel elon r. musk drew baglino elon r. musk unidentified participant elon r. muskthank , j.b. yes , super glad , talk lot core technology area 've focused year . yes , thanks introducing , j.b. 're welcome . yes . yes , mean drew team really key lot powertrain innovation , factory innovation solar roof number thing . quite pleasure engineering discussion . mutually -- feeling mutual . right . cool . love , , bro . got version 3 supercharger . 's actually like scope technology advancing tesla really massive many front . mentioned , we've got version 3 solar roof coming soon . 've got version 3 supercharger 's deployed around world . 75 mile 5 minute capability , 250-kilowatt system . -- 'm sure lot used supercharger . 've typically anywhere 75 kilowatt -- 've used one recently , might gotten 140 kilowatt . 's version 2. version 3 250 kilowatt . 250 kilowatt charging really eﬃcient car , mile per minute super good . fact , think recently test -- 'm sure . tested like car could charge number mile half hour . model 3. 's -- yes . ... 'll publishing new map supercharger deployment . we're finally going get trans-canada highway -- example ... alaska ? , 're going go alaska , . yes , actually , -- map n't even include location . really like 2 critical factor found sale given region really obvious actually : service center within reasonable distance supercharger route 'd like take ? n't want like ( 80 % ) route like , geez , 1 trip ca n't ? really want supercharger service center , absolute key sale . really , map sale -- like basically people like sensible . 're like , `` okay , need service car need able travel conveniently long-distance route . '' 've got , -- sale good . also good consumer financing make sure pricing competitive . 's -- soon people see , buy car . 's pretty straightforward . yes . 'll expanding supercharger network quite substantially time also enabling tesla use high-speed charging network . like adapter . key , like buy car , 're buying freedom , freedom travel . -- must supercharger . must high-speed charging . car break , must fixed quickly . 'm actually really excited mobile service . mobile service van come fix car soon break . actually immediately send note tesla mobile service way fix car . we're actually -- trialed bay area extended l.a. area number others tire repair . 'll come -- van arrive , give new tire half hour . 're way . 's like -- make huge difference . 's -- 're adding thing like bumper repair minor like collision repair . look thing trouble customer , 's thing like collision repair taking eternity . third-party body shop charging arm leg taking eternity . 're moving lot body repair in-house tesla even providing mobile service . first bumper replacement mobile service van . like typically , collision repair take week month . case , took le hour , yes . ... 's right , cyberpunk truck , yes . obviously got -- think product road map tesla incredibly exciting obviously model coming fairly soon , year pickup truck , hope unveil hopefully summer . spent lot time designing pickup truck . 's -- think 's going great . think 's coolest car 've seen frank . think 's -- everyone may share opinion . worst case scenario , 'll build normal looking truck . problem . know look like . something 'll -- 're driving road , look like came sci-fi movie . really cool , think . semi , really look forward getting production hopefully towards end next year . lot also dependent ability manufacture lot cell make lot battery pack . 's much point adding product complexity n't enough battery . 's complexity . without gain . we're - elon r. musk - jeffrey b. straubel - elon r. musk - drew baglino - elon r. muskmatching product rollout according scaling battery production . that's really main limiting factor . scale battery production high level , actually look supply chain . might get mining business , know , maybe , little bit least . 'll whatever , ensure scale fastest rate possible . point , going battery powertrain investor day . that's hopefully summer , end year , sure , think big deal . mean think outside investor , would really focus 2 thing : time line full self-driving . plan scale battery production get cost per kilowatt hour lower ? -- 's basically battery cell full self-driving . 2 strategic thing importance . question answer haha . exactly . question asked online uploaded . 're actually really smart question . really impressed think 's say.com sayanything . yes . key question : going scale battery production match vehicle demand ? guy want say anything ? n't let cat bag much . still bag . mean , think 's right . mean exactly right problem need solve scale . time . 's obvious think ever need large-scale solution cell production . yes . get cost per kilowatt hour lower intensity higher . yes . 're sitting -- yes , 're sitting idly . 're taking move required master destiny technologically otherwise . think experience 've developed partner otherwise , -- -- solution place . - drew baglino - elon r. musk - drew baglino - elon r. muskyes . good question . aspect battery production integration maxwell ? think really quite strategic . 'll leave detail kind battery powertrain investor day . -- important technology think big effect cost scaling cell production , reducing cost reducing capital required scale cell production . want add ? . right . absolutely . 'm sometimes little optimistic time frame . 's time knew . 's time knew . yes , optimism . would n't optimistic ? geez . -- actually advanced summon early access right . 're making steady improvement . 's close amazing . 's quite . 's close . 's lot complexity parking lot , turn . would easy 're like open ground summoned car drive . 's problem . 've got navigate parking lot 're effectively going maze lot obstacle people moving car moving , 's quite tricky . -- 's close magical . feel good , going wide release relatively fairly soon . yes . mean , want good . mean 's simplest answer . 's got awesome . 's got awesome super safe . ca n't -- n't want like run anyone would bad . 's tricky . like make car really sensitive , grows paranoid n't move . n't want make aggressive 's bad , . -- really threshold , convenient summon car walk car . 's convenient walk car , summon useful . move reasonably fast , certainly faster could walk . ? status tesla insurance . 're pretty close able release . small acquisition need complete bit software write . wo n't long release . yes , pickup truck event , sometime -- probably sometime -- towards end summer would guess . like , 're trying create something really new derivative vehicle road , 're trying create something new 's basically copy form factor everything else . still want great . 's hard . hard thing . goal something 's functional f-150 , great truck top-selling car -- top-selling vehicle u.s. -- also better sport car basic 911. 's hard one . like physically possible . think . yes . -- think tesla could rely spacex ' starlink ? think would different antenna starlink starlink antenna -- think 's actually probably advanced phased array antenna world , including military . 's size medium pizza . would fine truck rv airplane kind like house business something like . would look little odd roof sedan . think -- could make smaller antenna maybe use . think likely , would continue rely cellular network . value starlink -- main value starlink providing low-latency , high-bandwidth access sparse moderately sparse , like , look , relatively low-density area . like basically rural semirural area , place n't connectivity right . think 's like quite great system . probably able serve like 3 % 5 % people world . 's lot people people world . 's actually ideal high- density city . 's really serve underserved poorly served , starlink's . 're going tiny wiper . think actually probably applying hydrophobic coating likely solve problem . issue front radar accumulate ice snow front radar obscured . apply -- thin hydrophobic coating , sort water-repellent coating , -- usually solves problem . probably something like word -- please clean snow camera . feel good demand . 's , think , major issue . profitability always challenging 're fast growing company . think scale tesla 's growing like hard appreciate . last year , doubled ﬂeet . like -- made many car last year entire history . year , going pretty similar least sort 60 % 80 % growth total vehicle ﬂeet , maybe . 's hard profitable level growth . slow . would good sustainability cost electric vehicle solar storage . -- think cash ﬂow positive despite high growth rate . ... update like rideshare ? guess like sort could kind practice rideshare ﬂeet people good figuring thing robotaxi ﬂeet future . mean might make sense . mean 'll probably something like , probably make sense , yes , sort supervised robotaxi . yes , 'd happy take question audience . q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk - drew baglino - elon r. muskwow . okay . yes . n't know side 're starting . n't know , right side . sure . name ( brian campbell ) . shareholder tesla couple year . try buy share often afford . really believe company , product , mission , leadership . want -- feel privileged able cast lot . want thank whole tesla team hard work dedication . question pertains tesla energy . read several analysis concluding significant hurdle along path towards sustainable energy transmission electricity long distance . since renewable energy production capacity concentrated certain region , able eﬃciently transmit electricity -- region seems important part equation . hoping might share thought part equation might make sense tesla someday get involved electricity transmission . yes , think -- big part value solar roof retrofit solar roof house business whatnot localized power generation . battery storage , 's also helpful stabilizing grid . sort overproduce energy day release night actually use powerwalls powerpacks massive network grid stabilization providing energy , essentially ﬂowing back grid . would make big difference reducing need long-distance power line . think people want long-distance power line . 're generally great -- n't look great . 's sort slightly unnerving drive kind thing . want localized power generation . n't need build substation long-distance power line . think 's answer . also , storage really great way improve utilization existing transmission grid . transmission grid kind like highway system . 's rarely busy . storage make busy time . get lot utilization existing infrastructure . yes . fact , like one thing think could pretty interesting utility . 've done lot large-scale utility battery installation , notably one south australia , significantly outperformed expectation . we're going number project australia around world . 've done big project california . think energy storage , drew pointing , actually extremely important . could actually probably locally put powerpacks substation . n't know substation 's sort like high power line come get dropped like , say , 11,000 volt 400 volt 500 volt get distributed community . - drew baglino - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. muskyou see bunch weird looking electrical equipment bunch -- high power line coming , 's called substation . could , footprint , fit number powerpacks . drew 's point , power usage low like night drop considerably , charge powerpacks discharge day . would n't need build extra substation power line , disruptive community . 's exactly southern california edison project . substation exactly . 's good existence proof . yes . ( tony miller ) , shareholder . china place 's lot car action right . 's lot volume , lot growth market . 60 % ev . want ask giga 3 project goal . building 're building fremont-scale operation , maybe little bit bigger . last year , said 500,000 unit per year target . seems little bit low ... okay . sure . think 're probably ... company -- country like china . would give u like 29 % player , provider product seller stayed still , wo n't . also , we're volume going higher volume , learn , get cost . 's good thing . also , connect supply chain , powerful , advanced car electronics , battery , panasonic , catl , samsung lg , people like . demand side , import fee , car compare well product . chinese like tesla , style , luxury , quality , range . -- plus , need help getting rid smog city . -- maybe could even export factory asian factory . target set 500,000 ? think , china , aggressive enough ? hold . seen fast china factory built ? yes . two month le . q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participanti 've never seen anything built fast life . pretty epic . nothing ever built fast ( actually really ) ... 2 ? yes , okay . okay . ca n't spend money fast . 'll run . 's like - - 're -- yes , 're -- mean think like long term , factory probably 500,000. sort like interim goal , maybe 1 million long term . probably , look maybe -- like china pretty big geographically . may make sense factory part china order reduce logistics cost . -- like big impact capital eﬃciency company time receive raw material building product getting product end customer . compress time ideally -- ideal circumstance , receive payment car pay ingredient car , faster grow , capital . important localize product production supply chain close everything move really fast actually scale . faster scale , cash . whereas counterpoint , pay ingredient long get paid car , currently true car outside u.s. put boat , go custom , transport within europe china . non-u . s. production challenging cash ﬂow standpoint pay everything long get paid car . big advantage local production china europe solving cash ﬂow gap . ( daniel andy ) , 'm public real estate investment industry . given continued need supercharger expansion , think 's opportunity partner public real estate -- publicly traded real estate company buy land tesla want supercharger even buy land tesla currently owns supercharger , structure lease initially cover cost holding land . experience public real estate , think would huge demand invest necessary infrastructure ev charging , , effectively tesla , would finance aggressively speed supercharger expansion preserving tesla 's capital . would interest ? well supercharger location actually either free leased low rate . actually , sometimes pay u . - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. musk q - unidentified participant - elon r. muskfrom think though , provide capital equipment , correct , even get free ? yes . 'm sure 's lease . even cell tower reit , lease land . lease equipment . even equipment could financed , think , publicly traded real estate company . okay , think 's essentially like adding supercharger asset-backed line . little tricky -- -- dealing finance company , generally say 's resale value worst-case scenario . 's like sort tricky , say -- sell . , think , tends objection . generally , think capital eﬃciency supercharger quite , quite good getting better . ... work industry . question , 'd love talk . right . right . thank . name ( dennis mcavoy ) 've happy model 3 model owner since 2012. believe 'm representative vast majority tesla owner super happy company product . think next car we're going get going another tesla .

's true , true , say . 's distressing . make sad . 'm sure -- yes . n't know . provide rebuttal . typically varied . 's like 7 paragraph 's . thing incredibly crazy . 's least 10x likely gasoline car combustion engine car , 's name . mean , come , highly ﬂammable ﬂuid 's designed burn . 's 200,000 gasoline car fire per year u.s. alone . -- 's extremely rare tesla car catch fire . , 's incredibly rare 's due extenuating circumstance . slow . 's almost never harmful . mean would rather like gasoline-powered cell phone battery-powered cell phone ? mean 's like no- brainer . think put kind energy towards solving problem put towards solving battery module production problem , could . could change narrative . well 're really trying best . -- 'm somewhat loss -- 's like n't respond anything .
