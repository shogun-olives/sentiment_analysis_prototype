'll talk f & b , small medium- sized business . 's say business n't seeing opportunity market . 's need get eﬃcient 've ever . q - karl keirstead - jared spataro q - karl keirstead - jared spataro q - karl keirstead - jared spataro q - karl keirstead - jared spataro jared , know cyber security portfolio might formally part group , obviously e5 's use , 's important driver . also seeing evidence vendor consolidation , maybe opportunity take cisco webex zoom ? seeing cyber security side ? mind elaborating specifically might seeing ? sure . yes , think 're right security essentially taking fragmented space consolidation play . 's play security since beginning . secure software , secure thing like email team , go beyond . great offering come identity , come apps , come device securing device , take zero-trust approach . play come . part put context sell . 's part microsoft 365 e5 me5 , 'll hear u refer , single biggest driver me5 growth security . security compliance compliance , phone system well . start put together value prop , get something , compelling customer . okay . let 's keep going macro change . 's probably dominant subject day environment ﬂuid , software company ' growth rate little bit pressure . within modern work portfolio , jared , could pause little bit talk microsoft might seeing pressure ? think , amy ir team talked lot smb pressure , could elaborate pressure point portfolio ? yes , bet . specifically earnings said saw moderation new deal volume outside e5 . okay . moderation new deal volume outside e5 -- e3 , let 's say . q - karl keirstead - jared spatarocorrect . let unpack e3 component think 's important . give sense sku lineup , maybe know already , look like ( technical diﬃculty ) e3 level e5 . softening saw new deal volume end e3 layer . perspective , imagine dig start see . really two component . certainly macro . think people saying , gosh , right , ready make purchase ? certainly impacting 're mentioned smb , 's smb u . u , 's moderately sized company typically service direct sale force , partner sale force would cloud solution provider channel way service folk . 's portion 's macro , 'm totally honest . 's portion 's execution u . sometimes get little bit high e5 train put everything 've got behind e5 forget 've got two-stroke engine business . 've got e3 component , 've got e5 component . went look going , macro issue saw . also execution issue 're working hard address quarter going forward well . jared , one macro-related issue 're monitoring degree layoff across global economy . 's little bit acute think tech sector . thankfully , guy n't big part , others . maybe question 'm getting across oﬃce broadly 365 , 's sensitivity portfolio headcount growth across economy ? obviously , pick , 's good thing . presume 's measure minimum seat client commit , ca n't come much pressure . maybe little color sensitivity layoff , given 's hot topic listening ? watch closely everybody . watched job report came . watch industry growing shrinking right . let back second talk sensitivity , remind , business , largely speaking , ( technical diﬃculty ) business . 's . price time quantity business . think quantity enterprise space , largely place well penetrated . mean either oﬃce 365 're moving microsoft 365. enterprise space , play anything else two-fold . number one , price component . 're trying drive arpu . 's brand new queue enterprise frontline worker . 's brand-new u . really taken , accelerated pandemic , 's understand counterintuitive . q - karl keirstead - jared spataro q - karl keirstead - jared spataro q - karl keirstead - jared spataro q - karl keirsteadin fact , three month pandemic , paused everything related frontline work , thinking nobody 's going invest given tumult . 's happened . restart thing next 60 day told everybody stop saw digital transformation accelerated much first time ever across industry , people putting device putting new cloud service hand frontline worker , needed help , provided really interesting boost u . think sensitive , well , sensitive headcount , see enterprise , n't feel like 's big change . sensitivity come ability continue get frontline worker smbs . smb typically 'll see kind immediate impact macro crunch . interestingly enough , seen 've waiting term smb slowdown seat . look recent reporting q1 , 14 % year- over-year growth seat , would think driven largely flw smb would see immediate slow , watching slow . 's happened . keep hawk eye well job report looked u.s. , looked pretty good actually . yes . maybe 's reminder index tech-specific headcount cut 're seeing , given breadth oﬃce suite . really think point given breadth business , servicing economy , broadly point . yes . give u ability put take think -- see thing go . , watch certain sector like smb , 'll watch continue watch . far , 's mixed signal macro economically . macroeconomic signal turn worse , think lot investor assume might queue deteriorates , 'm asking prognosis , let's say , key becomes lot important . let 's talk actually . right . - jared spataro q - karl keirstead - jared spataro q - karl keirstead - jared spataro q - karl keirsteadbecause 's big part story . yes . maybe couple element . obviously microsoft announced fairly material oﬃce 365 price increase , elaborate little bit 's rolling ? bet . price increase 'll talk little bit value me5 , 'll start price increase second . okay . price increase became effective 1st march . first price increase ever done , like long time . first ever done since 've oﬃce 365. felt like waiting right time enough value . 'd introduced 25 new apps , introduced 1,400 new capability . gone pandemic , done lot establish , felt like lot goodwill , particularly enterprise customer . issued lot free trial , mean 's lot going . took opportunity point say think 're delivering value increased price . think price increase rolling , however , 's really important kind essentially look detail business . first , temporal aspect price increase . become effective particular account renew post-price increase , post 1 march , agreement microsoft . 've got lot timing play agreement renewing . agreement tend three year , sometimes 're five year long . 's component staggered pricing 's happening . 's also component skus included . look announcement 'd published name , specific . 'll give example , n't increase price me5 . right . - jared spataro q - karl keirstead - jared spataro q - karl keirstead - jared spataro actually driving people me5 . also n't increase price would call kind standard tier smb space . n't increase price standalone . place chose increase price . , rest assured try , data-driven would drive people right place overall sku line-up . last thing 'll say , think kind component , sku line- component , 's kind ratable revenue component 're going recognize revenue time well . take sku component , take agreement renewal component , take ratable revenue component , 's going play time . big driver u , 's could . n't think 's something happen immediately . yes . jared , team , spent many day disaggregating blog post try back blended oﬃce 365 price increase . spent lot time . let 's talk another arpu driver touched earlier 's e5 mix shift . beyond straight-up price increase , 've got amazing arpu growth catalyst form e5 sku , think microsoft announced think 12 % seat ? 's right . could 12 % go , realistically ? -- 's -- never going 100 % , 's trajectory e5 next think , even want frame qualitatively ? think 're early journey me5 . 'll answer question , 'll back give picture second . let 's pick data point , 12 % oﬃce 365 install base me5 today , 12 % . say way think go high . let tell driver think . number one driver e5 security . talked idea consolidation security . security demand continues increase u , security continues complex company administer . feel like , man , 've got real driver n't feel like 's going let coming month . second driver u end compliance . also really interesting opportunity u , particularly think consolidation . third q - karl keirstead - jared spatarodriver e5 phone system . n't talked much , people moving usage communication team , natural thing move phone system typically on-prem version pbx team phone system cloud . qualitatively without giving forward-looking kind specific , would simply say , 12 % early journey . think me3 base could go me5 , could n't see reason customer would n't want value , 'll continue push . n't something feel like proportion certain percentage base would . yes . maybe pivot little bit m365 story . , 've leading , living breathing . lot investor , 've delivered oﬃce 365 metric subtly see microsoft pivoting conversation m365 . feel like m365 bundling story big success , bigger part messaging . talk little bit shift o365 m365 term messaging investor , customer ?
