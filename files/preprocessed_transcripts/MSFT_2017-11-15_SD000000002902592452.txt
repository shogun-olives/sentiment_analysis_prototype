okay . 'll go ahead get everyone seated keep going . know starting get late afternoon . -- okay , feel like 'm house . like talking kid . okay . 're going go ahead get started everyone want get seated . welcome , takeshi numoto , stage . happy takeshi u microsoft . charge one -- well , 's corporate vice president cloud & enterprise , obviously really transformed entire story microsoft . picked coverage microsoft , think 2002 hambrecht & quist/jpmorgan right beginning covering software group . completely different story . still talking nt . prepping oﬃce 2003 cycle different thing . still , extent , informs bit piece story . takeshi team done cloud & enterprise side transform entire technology industry . 're lucky today go story . 'm going read safe harbor comment , begin , microsoft may make forward-looking statement presentation . refer sec filing risk factor relating business . that's true whether 're person listening web . web , thank well joining u . , 'll welcome takeshi . thanks much coming . question answer q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt guess , 'd like start . 've got detailed question . -- maybe talk 're spending time . specifically , 've got wide purview , 've got one exciting business microsoft , cut across lot different product area . focused right ? top priority ? inform 're thinking strategy business general ? well first , 's great . thanks . focus priority standpoint , 're , committed growing server cloud revenue double digit . saw 17 % growth q1 led lot cloud growth azure . 's something want continue go drive . mentioned nt back day . 've company 20 year . 's amazing privilege part amazing journey . started engineer window nt , 've current role corporate vice president cloud & enterprise marketing basically responsible sort azure , window server , sql server product go server cloud bucket , , well dynamic business application get reported part productivity space external reporting segment standpoint . -- i've role six year . prior , worked oﬃce oﬃce 365. least last 10 year , feel like 've working cloud , cloud , cloud driving cloud growth long journey . 's amazing . want -- 'll start azure . 'll move server dynamic . 're thinking day day right , 're spending time -- excuse , 'm sorry , 've sneezing little bit . 've spending time customer , point trying still proselytize azure story , inward-facing term spending time recently ? think 's -- feel like sort lot running back forth . mean running front line customer partner engagement . last week , spent week road , probably met 30 , 40 partner customer series week . still continuing really get sense 's really happening front line customer partner engagement . time , come back corporate spending lot time development team , thinking road map business strategy . role really sort cause go back forth lot . right . -- thinking sort partner ecosystem evolved get specifically azure question . 's different partner model . mean remember back day think 600,000 - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numotoreseller channel , one microsoft 's core strength . azure story cloud story , partner -- 's different story . red hat talking embedding cloud service openshift . whole different set possibility respect partner ecosystem . story use case evolving really getting traction , mind share ecosystem ? well think every customer 's journey cloud unique . lot effort spanning broad range area sort meet 're . sometimes , customer want basically sort think appending cloud capability already on-prem . might around adding monitoring management backup disaster recovery using azure secondary site . might sort basic first step . may customer -- customer really thinking much cloud-centric rearchitecting application deploying azure azure stack want deployment ﬂexibility . 're seeing extreme . 's large portion middle customer really thinking migrating workload azure . , try meet essentially making kind migration workload ( maybe ) technology . azure migrate , service help customer migrate virtual machine also working partner solution well database migration service enables customer migrate database azure . technology investment 're making . 're also making sort think business model investment help customer transition , example , azure hybrid benefit benefit offer customer software assurance software license estate . software assurance -- 're annuity customer window server , example , give substantial discount , actually saving 40 % , basically run window server virtual machine azure . combined migration benefit term technology deliver also business benefit . whether 's sort appending azure sort on- prem estate full-on rearchitecting application sort migration existing workload , want solution work really hard meet customer 're . think mix use case ? reason ask think people still perceive 's happening azure lot new workload development . maybe lift shift maybe much point . true ? starting see migration work ? yes . like 3 pattern mentioned , 3 growing . think overall customer 's journey cloud , like overall journey market , think 're still early inning . 3 type use case growing right . want continue address . 're also seeing even sort -- would refer sort migration kind workload , bigger q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holtworkloads come azure , might ask , let 's say , two year ago , may many customer engagement around , let 's say , dev test erp estate , example . today , 're seeing largest customer move production safety workload azure . 's getting migrated becoming bigger substantial mission-critical . 's also driving growth well . say 're seeing production workload sap move azure ? yes , really . really ... 's sap , like 's example mission-critical big workload lot consumption associated . said , ca n't really think . maybe 's trading application n't many example application would complex , processing-intensive data-intensive sap erp application . that's interesting . think ? -- customer reference ? scalability ? location proximity ? 's really driving ? well think 's sort hard attribute one factor , 's conﬂuence many thing . think increasing openness confidence customer use cloud . 've cloud journey . becoming familiarized comfortable vector . -- maturity side , customer side vendor side . 's also , like think , increasing recognition cloud place really realize high agility sort dynamic change need . people think technology cloud becomes much mainstream conversation dialogue . view , mean , sap , large sap workload azure , really limitation migrate on-premise azure environment ? - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt certainly would conversation customer , `` hi . really take big workload thing like erp sap , '' good example . know used sap example . seeing -- technical limitation thing oracle thing big industry application ? whether isv application , work isvs like temenos banking application run azure . like said , increasing repertoire example highly big mission-critical workload coming azure . okay . environment , maybe walk typical example , going using typically infrastructure service ? going typically migrating database ? going typically using adjunct platform service building connectivity on-premise application data service ? would -- walk u maybe example would look like practice usage perspective . , like said , cloud journey unique every customer . move major workload , definitely lot adjacency get pulled . n't move core workload , well , core workload lot data sits cloud . 's natural next step customer think essentially applying lot data technology analytics data resides cloud . data adjacency often see . also kind core application bring lot adjacent system . -- whether 's expense report system surround core application , actually often new application get built , whether 's mobile application hand stuff like . 's core workload . adjacency pull-through effect something 're seeing . take step back look azure growth trajectory general , , 's sort -- 's tough question 's many different input . 're pace outgrow aws similar scale . biggest difference appear , one , positioning around hybrid ; two , positioning around premium service discussing ability move sap oracle workload ongoing workload cloud . principal factor view driving higher growth ? - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto well certainly think -- leadership enterprise space , 's certainly key factor helping u . developed product really enterprise mind way way deploy region azure . 42 region announced azure , cloud vendor , part want address enterprise customer need able deploy application data close place consumption need also deal regulatory environment data residency requirement often . certainly , enterprise focus leadership position enterprise key factor . mentioned hybrid , obviously another big factor . vendor starting talk 've consistently start n't initially think hybrid end state . n't go hybrid , end cloud . n't think transitionary state . actually think hybrid state state long haul , may heard satya talk intelligent cloud intelligent edge , believe computing becomes ever ubiquitous , computing becomes powerful cloud also edge , . asset cloud provider -- 're cloud-only player , also deliver software essentially work harmoniously service provide cloud enable new scenario . 's key differentiator . also think product like azure stack , 's getting lot customer interest . 're feeling really sort bullish approach 're taking . u , hybrid n't connectivity colo , 's really providing consistent platform customer , whether around identity platform management plane data technology . really end-to-end consistent platform , think , key requirement customer move forward . okay . -- may unfair question look cloud customer , percentage would say leveraging microsoft on- premise technology ? well certainly enterprise space , think 'll hard-pressed find enterprise customer microsoft technology . . maybe let ( scope ) differently , using microsoft data center technology . 'm talking somebody might using oﬃce window desktop side , 'm talking somebody using microsoft server microsoft sql microsoft biztalk , something traditional data center stack leveraging azure service . customer ? q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numotowell think enterprise . , think hard-pressed find enterprise customer n't window server . -- may use -- mix estate , might high low . lot customer high mix -- think ( often pretty feel ) give u good engagement point talk customer even use -- 's small portion estate . okay . thinking way azure business change position application business , mean , one question get time see press new application built n't built c # . built .net . n't know 's true , -- see press lot . seems like azure , 's ability kind reintermediate microsoft newer application developed 's easier run maybe nonnative application azure footprint run application n't built specifically window server . true ? well certainly looking meet developer . like many front . azure perspective , 're point 40 % virtual machine running azure data center today basically linux virtual machine . -- would certainly personally expect number go move forward . -- 's operating system , work really hard made lot progress supporting variety open source operating system language framework , whether node python r database service like managed database service postgraph mysql . today , 're announcing 've joined maria db foundation . offer maria db managed service well . 's operating system also language framework data technology 're supporting essentially onboard many developer possible -- meet . bring skill . use -- favorite tech available use azure . 're also extending capability like .net across platform . hope know .net already available across platform . 've open sourced . tremendous amount community energy poured onto . 've also extended reach developer tool . think developer tool , visual studio code something people -- giving u great feedback development environment top linux mac developer . 's actually helping u reach developer . fact , number active developer using visual studio expanded significantly . across front , 're basically much embracing broader set developer goal onboarding azure . 're service level , 're language level like open sourcing .net also extending tool -- far ( ground one ) cloud concerned , driving consumption really top ( inaudible ) . lead -- people room maybe call standpoint , might sort characterize patent expansion sense 're saying , `` hi . linux customer os database mongodb customer , cassandra customer , would n't anything sell on-prem . support mongodb cassandra apis cosmos db q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holtsorts language framework harness azure . could characterize tam expansion . yes , mean , kind point seems like positioning business completely changed -- addition functional change term product deliver delivery model change , also put different place technology development process . one deal worked qatalyst sold xamarin . quite sort idea reaching broader base mobile application developer . going back something said . 40 % virtual machine running -- running azure linux . number go . think ? development -- sorry , adoption open source ? something -- something specific driving number -- 's actually higher number thought . 's actually -- sound like think go even higher . would expect inch time , yes . think ? think 's big use case virtual machine ? well lot os workload often also fundamentally scaleout-based term architecture . tends spawn virtual machine consumption grows opposed scale-up -- use bigger profitable virtual machine . customer running -- 'm trying think revenue opportunity -- like would much rather make $ 10 dollar . able monetize , like said , cassandra , mongodb , may first choice , first choice would cosmos . well cosmos support apis ... -- think 's terrific strategy . economics change ? somebody 's running linux virtual environment , mean term revenue opportunity set versus somebody might running window hyper-v environment running window stack instead linux stack ? change ? - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt well term -- think additive . n't economic opportunity people oss-based . offer service . service consumption get monetized cloud . right . guess , 'm trying quantify . spend -- 're taking customer 's spending $ 10 microsoft stack , could get $ 2 somebody 's running linux stack azure ? oh , n't know , like -- n't necessarily think conversion right left . . 'm saying 's additive . 'm trying quantify additive could . n't think quote number . know 'll interested . ( chris ) ? okay . got try . well , got agree 's additive . really ... yes . . 's said would much rather see get $ 10 getting dollar . think 's much better play . 's -- 's totally different positioning story within azure cloud workload moving microsoft point point b. 's moving microsoft point point b also putting microsoft front point c able move point d. mean , getting linux different thing could n't touch otherwise . platform lock-in longer issue point . n't really matter language build . 's totally different -- whole argument , hey , new application built c # garbage . 're seeing basically growing community .net . - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numotoyes . okay , got . 's terrific . well -- important think getting big referenceable application customer onto azure ? specifically , work 've done adobe well publicized . -- google salesforce deal . google , far understand , 's really first referenceable big application , cloud application vendor run gcp . important get kind company onto azure ? think getting application , particularly business -- large business application onto azure , incredibly important , , ﬂywheel effect business estate deposited cloud essentially creates gravity data application . 's certainly important . 's example , like sap one mentioned adobe great example . 're continuing work enlisting isv partnership bring application azure . migrate either isv run azure -- use adobe example , know many others -- somebody move sap -- n't know lot work workload azure . would fall category premium service ? well depends resource . basically , definition premium service thing beyond basically raw compute storage . could management service security service , could database service managed nature . managed database service sql postgraph managed nosql service like cosmos db . -- iot -- -- fall premium bucket . right . 's really classification around premium defined either scale app required ... 's type -- resource type , would say . got . look portfolio premium use case , think satya get asked question look every conference call tends talk ai , tends talk cosmos . guess , 2 question . think scale premium service relative whole ? 5 % business ? 10 % business ? secondarily ... q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holtyou 're asking number ca n't give , think . ( chris ) , ask speak . sorry , phone 's going . 's reminding ask question ca n't answer . -- okay , well , 'm trying get -- sense -- mean , another way ask question , probably wo n't able give either . term magnitude growth , way talk -- really help u size . possible sort characterize , well , 20 % growth coming premium service , something along line ? think thing really remember u externally talking premium service basically 13 consecutive quarter triple-digit growth . well , azure near triple-digit growth . growing rapid rate . certainly , premium service outgrowing sort overall azure bit . respect service popular , ai , iot , cosmos one , said , satya talk , second generation think going become , next two year , popular ? think one listed continue big driver premium growth . one might mention would management security service growing think thing like enterprise mobility suite , enterprise mobility security . based ( adfs ) capability offer active directory delivering premium capability device management capability application management capability . think also see lot synergy company customer picking vendor view strategic partner cloud journey . 's azure discussion 's really microsoft cloud discussion . think journey , think see increasingly customer thinking think holistically . 's boding well u think fortune 500 company , talk 90 % customer using microsoft cloud . perhaps one really get excited even 90 % number fact 60 % company using 3 service . notion really picking vendor support journey cloud across saas , across paas , across iaa , think , customer want . think put u really nice place . management security side , mentioned enterprise mobility , think everything need identity front ? - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt mean , never worked product n't additional request customer . 'll always need . 's product . okay . 's -- okay . 'm going shift . 've got minute left 'll turn audience . 'm going shift talk little bit on- premise business maybe finish couple question dynamic time . on-premise business continues strong . love idea , symbiotic relationship on-premise cloud , extent , offering cloud credit cloud discount , 're helping perpetuate strength on-premise . sole factor think driving kind steady single-digit growth ? think 're still gaining share ? 've done math would suggest 're actually increasing average selling price still . maybe walk u element growth story -- people tend think 's cloud tie . think may . see . 's variety dynamic going . certainly , like value proposition around hybrid definitely helping u , whether technical side term product work together business synergy 're bringing bear customer like azure hybrid benefit mentioned . also , think place feel like 're taking share key workload , whether feel like sql great value proposition customer . think value prop bring , give in-memory oltp , in-memory bi , in-memory advanced analytics , machine learning . built single product . feel like tremendous market momentum . 's also available linux . think amount customer basically starting try product based number like docker hub pool measure , 're seeing tremendous amount interest . bodes well aspiration go grow business on-prem even . 's another aspect -- essentially sort strength think -- think pinion mix . customer really think journey cloud , want basically environment premise 's compatible cloud . lead virtualization , higher density use workload even on-prem . translates sale -- strength thing like window server data center addition , sql server enterprise addition , would call premium . 's aspect premium mix lever 's helping sustain health on- premise business . help ? . certainly . premium story , -- chart initiation looked sort value get server steadily increased . enabling -- mean , thing people seem willing pay ? 's debate - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holtbundled versus actually increase value . see sort 1 2 piece functionality actually causing people upgrade premium service ? like said , 's basically use technology sort make environment compatible cloud , like higher density virtualization bigger hardware core , necessitates basically cover core . lead premium sale . factor . okay , got . azure stack , mentioned earlier , said 's good early demand . 's market month , right ? yes . 's early day sure . something 's going show -- mean , thinking business ? bolster -- mean , going show server side , on-premise side ? show cloud side ? see . think great question sort also illuminates , , 're focused really driving server cloud double digit like , technically speaking , azure stack , think feature azure . buy azure stack deploy , way charge consumptive . mean customer spool virtual machine resource . 's paas service available , . could use app service , could use container service azure stack . build customer azure build even though hardware sits on-premise . 's pay go essentially . customer really want -- basically get reported cloud revenue . customer really want able use technology disconnected state . business model address . sell kind disconnected state way , show server revenue externally . product product term deliver 's sort -- depending customer consume . mean , 's new product . want get overly enthusiastic . seem get lot airtime , particularly ( ray ) , team , absolutely love . -- thinking ramp kind product fiscal '19 story ? really , 's going take couple quarter get channel ? getting selling motion ? something different release could faster respect impact ? - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt q - unidentified participant - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt kind feel like 's little early tell customer buzz reaction customer also partner . ask hardware partner , think really pleased sort action 're seeing . we're bullish . think 's little early day . awesome . let -- 'm trying think . 'll stop take question ﬂoor . 'll hit dynamic question , n't question . think 're going couple 've got . 's one pink . question , azure win versus aws ? see gcp mix right ? think google 's trying differentiate ai tensorflow , competitive ? 's competitive response microsoft ? okay . term win , guess one 're seeing sort biggest differentiation resonates resonating customer basically enterprise focus leadership , whether sort engagement customer sort trust microsoft cloud vendor help deal regulatory compliance security requirement enterprise customer . think 's sort one big one . hybrid , talked , another one . looking way sort synergistically use on-prem essentially use cloud synergistic way opposed -- 's sort second one . would also say notion productivity big one . customer increasingly looking use cloud like 'd really need leading edge set developer broader set developer organization productive using cloud . whether devops capability service offer thing like visual studio team service thing visual studio extend reach . every developer , whatever skill set , whatever preference technology , apply technology , productive way azure . think 's really resonating . one 'd call . - - asked , see google lot ? 'll lying say n't see . , say , compare year ago , see lot ? see -- run time time . 'm sure changed whole lot . term ai sort technology , lot investment 're bringing bear year investment made microsoft azure showing place like cognitive service offer azure . also support thing like tensorflow azure . run really well . 's area continue compete furiously . also seeing really interesting use case azure make u pretty bullish . q - unidentified participant - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holta question left . conference morning , ubs talked excited azure stack . talking term future , perhaps suggesting still waiting couple feature part development order accelerate spending . kind thing roadblock -- current roadblock thing developed accelerate azure stack ? term exploration azure stack , mean , first , aspect hardware partner ' product available yet . already available market . mean think already azure stack basically purchasable 47 country . really enables great coverage hybrid . got get partner ' product available . 're working . 's aspect azure service run azure stack . portfolio get richer time . already paas service like container service app service available write application common way public cloud azure azure stack . want continue add portfolio time . question ? 've got couple question dynamic , 's okay . one thing think sort dual-pronged set driver dynamic business , one , fact application business globally seems better . mean , 's better oracle , 's better sap . 's good salesforce . seems bit tailwind , plus 've got 365 story tell . talk , one , believe -- agree first premise application market feel little bit better ; two , 365 accelerant 's actually showing market . 'm sure like mean like application market , seems ( mean ) like azure growing great . instead -- n't want say one . think customer think journey cloud . one increased appetite 'm seeing customer 's willingness sort say , `` hi . app deploy rather custom one , like app , basically ready-made solution . '' bodes well sort paas business application . 're certainly seeing dynamic 365 's growing -- grew 68 % , 69 % , forgot exact number basically around 70 % q1 . certainly aided customer ' appetite essentially business application served cloud . on-premise dynamic business point upgrading older version ? real new business 's done on-premise ? - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto q - adam hathaway holt - takeshi numoto new . new . true , , seeing lot appetite cloud . think new dynamic customer q1 , believe 3 4 customer chose cloud . -- mean , lot -- lot lot linkedin touchpoints dynamic . year , think actually practice ? -- linkedin integration , think , either impacted win rate revenue trajectory business ? yes , -- dynamic standpoint , 've seen really good synergy essentially call relationship -- microsoft relationship sale solution offer combine dynamic 365 sale linkedin . 've seen customer like infosys realize really great benefit essentially really adopting relationship selling selling process . course , integrate something like sale navigator linkedin dynamic 365 , thing like make sure find people within organization give warm intro lead opposed trying cold test . customer seeing substantial reduction essentially sale cycle improvement win rate . offering quite new . customer interest quite high . 're feeling pretty bullish . 're also increasing linkedin integration essentially hr front . dynamic 365 talent essentially integrates linkedin recruiter . , 's another area feel like deliver additional value customer . okay . time . thank . much coming . useful . thank much . thanks .
