's actually really helpful . 're active kind experiment . obviously 're obsessed , 've talked , talent putting right talent place , actually glue hold together . 's learning . learning , industry gone well , nothing really new , fact n't always need physical presence lot operation order support customer kind becoming obvious u . think summarize , really getting fine balance local empowerment , leadership , listening global scale rigor , speed implementation , right , that's really key thing , think key learning . even future . understood . maybe turning business . one often question get investor think addressable market ad , advertising . think ? yes . great question . look , think lot people general actually misunderstand -- addressable market . least hear lot conï¬‚icting view . way would think -- point hear often , let put way called above-the-line advertising market . 's $ 0.5 trillion market roughly across world , slightly different estimate . 's usually 's defined addressable market . 's obviously feel , below-the- line advertising market includes budget promotional pricing , product placement , sponsorship . 's , significant market well . 's completely different way looking . take different vector , example , look commerce penetration u.s. know , -- somewhere 80 % range commerce u.s. still conducted oï¬ „ ine . shifting time , obviously 's significant opportunity would say . - eric sheridan - philipp schindlerand general , think market , 're really business connecting business consumer actually business business . think like , think long 're really driving incremental roi partner advertiser , pretty good place . great . google started mission organizing world 's information . company 20 year journey . maybe talk little bit search evolved google continuing innovate mission . yes . look , mean make thousand improvement search every year . see billion search every day 15 % 've never seen , actually quite interesting number . pay tribute team working innovation behind everything go simply extraordinary . really incredible accomplishment . lot competition space . mean pick phone look different way access information . toe obviously . 's lot better lot future . give example innovation gone search literally like last couple year , take example artificial intelligence completely revolutionizing understanding natural language processing , natural language understanding . 've seen launch like bird model massive impact understand query search side , example . take video side . much deeper understanding deep semantics video , allows basically ï¬‚ip video like chapter book , impressive technology . take look thing like lens . could look google lens another input factor search . obviously different input vector , could type could speak could actually use image . progress 've seen area , lens recognize like area 15 billion different thing . 's large number . think 's 15x couple year ago . , significant progress . 's innovation . look product like map , example . way managed introduce give much higher percentage call busyness information , business , busyness , whether merchant , retailer place , restaurant busy . hugely important actually moment think distance management different thing . 've gone , think 5x since june last month type information . - eric sheridan - philipp schindlerif look something like augmented reality , live view map actually point camera business see , example , safety information business something along line , 's actually pretty complex . 've launched -- look duplex ai , example , business side , automated system reaching , updating information , task consumer . pretty impressive actually . thing look little bit like fun , like , pretty public , hum search launch , example , hum google recognize pretty sophisticated machine learning kind song 're humming . think base technology take time . actually little bit playful . 's lot innovation might always visible actually going core search product . well maybe 'll stick . lot . want stick search 1 minute curious . look -- focusing search , area improve customer experience , time , think lens increasing roi advertiser ? yes . look , make 100 enhancement ad world roughly every quarter . 's quite significant number . think easiest way think least easiest way think breaking different component part . let 's look 4 key driver -- let 's take search ad business second . number one obviously world query . key question that's , best place user turn need information ? next question obviously provide better answer ? provide comprehensive answer come type question ? real question , shift digital 're seeing moment , end line ? people going use rather search le look information search ? 's whole component , course . second big one obviously whole point around ad coverage , another big component . really , question percent query either commercial , number one ; , obviously 's percentage actually cover ad . , philosophy , 've stated many time , try use ad actually -- display ad helpful user 're helpful user . interesting number , 80 % search , actually show ad . ad 're actually seeing search form commercial intent . whatever could anything t-shirt , shoe , baby yoda , - eric sheridan - philipp schindlerdolls , whatever take , right ? question ask , actually optimized ? room ? better area ? third component whole thing obviously click-through rate . click-through rate depend lot different thing , question , -- ad 're actually serving giving best answer ? creatives -- best creatives obviously big impact . know click-through rate different industry , insight . big question , course 's , like really -- away 100 % , obviously ? path u better ? 's path u better , probably upside world . next one fourth component really , really important one obviously cost per click . cost per click really dependent , , obviously quality traï¬ƒc 're sending partner advertiser , number one . importantly , 's driven conversion rate . , thing 've said around click-through rate . past , insight conversion rate different industry , obviously far 100 % . question , still better ? help partner invest optimizing landing page ? better providing even better measurement tool conversion might even measured correctly ? better helping integrating different system ? . think 's probably best way look 4 factor , think innovation core search ad business still pretty vibrant . great . okay . earlier , referenced artificial intelligence , machine learning one earlier answer . 's lot buzz around ai machine learning continues among investment community broader social commentary especially google 's investment area . talk ai machine learning improves google 's user experience , ad offering value bring advertiser ? yes . talked 're core search innovation example . ai obviously play huge role come improving advertising product across whole bunch different area . 'll give example . product like responsive search ad , example . new campaign type introduced like performance max heavily built machine learning capability . product like smart display campaign , example , ai play integral role , frankly . broad match keywords , making - eric sheridan - philipp schindler - eric sheridanlot easier advertiser use ai basically keyword selection versus individually picking . could go . also keep mind ai ml get better . think 're actually -- interesting path ahead , would say . great . think one biggest learning past year pandemic clearly accelerated adoption e-commerce global scale . shift affected business ? look , 's doubt seen accelerated e-commerce adoption shift due , obviously covid . doubt . would say 2 big trend 're seeing . first one people buying thing online ever , definitely something that's benefiting business . 's benefiting others . see lot smbs local business actually managed transition correctly , also taking advantage trend . 's undeniable , number one . second one , would say multi-touch point actually , high demand , curbside pickup , pickup in-store . see query patent . look query like available near , example , query available near connected something somewhere 100 % range . look query pattern like curbside pickup , 's actually somewhere 3,000 % range . obviously merchant comprehensive offer take advantage probably pretty well positioned . see bunch whole -- across whole bunch different retailer . take - - simple example company like petco , actually see curbside pickup drove 100 % increase e-commerce business right adjustment . make intuitive sense obviously . general , would say advertiser best really one pivoted quickly react change user ' behavior , spent lot time understanding nuance , subtle shift demand position . they're probably best moment . got . want stick theme e-commerce maybe one question . google made number interesting announcement e- commerce shopping vertical past month , including free product listing google shopping tab , commission-free buy google checkout experience . - philipp schindler - eric sheridan - philipp schindlerhow see google 's market positioning changing post announcement ? next step think ahead google capitalize e-commerce opportunity 's still evolving ? look , took significant step mentioned correctly . 's really return first principle , 're honest , free listing , 0 commission . 's trying really trying help -- barrier online retail , help lower . want become even better place store connect actually potential customer . 's big part 're . 's different way . actively drive traï¬ƒc website . offer conversion site obviously . mean shopping ad , think 's important point well , continue powerful way play big role obviously connecting retailer different consumer . think general principle way think really want provide open platform . want make sure platform comprehensive possible , comprehensive -- relevant possible , basically mean need like great product , best product ideally best price , big selection , really , really important . 's feel there's slightly platform-y approach 're . really good path . also allows partner bring third-party provider like paypal shopify . think 're actually interesting , good track . okay . wanted turn youtube . historically , youtube heavily weighted brand advertising , though , recently , 've seen youtube successfully implement direct response advertising offering . talk strategy recent investment made attract direct response advertiser youtube platform ? yes .

's big part . also remember , big brand business youtube , successful brand business . hit hard early stage pandemic , doubt , really rebounded since , q3 . happy . see impressive metric , frankly . look overall youtube development , reached 18- 49-year-olds u.s. -- linear tv network combined . think . 's pretty meaningful number . yesterday nielsen -- give another idea thing heading . nielsen announced big first , 're actually going introducing new cross-media measurement solution actually reach different type video platform . 're happy happening -- heading . 're also experimenting interesting new thing , better product integration youtube . 's lot commercial intent youtube offer better shopping feature , look interesting shopping surface time . lot exciting stuff world . got . maybe turning another area . broadly think pursuing prioritizing new monetization opportunity across platform ? early learning , example , monetization product like map ? look , innovation , experimentation part dna . 's 've long time . map good example . look map 2 different way . look pure utility . basically help get point point b. 's one way looking . 's another way looking . see really incredible discovery surface , consumer discover lot different new world really , really important . think latter actually interesting path think intense -- , let 's say increased monetization future . 's also really relevant small business . 's theme 're pushing hard really feel 's important support . look small business product like business profile , 've made thousand improvement year , think - eric sheridan - philipp schindlercome together next-generation discovery area improvement map . think 's , interesting area future .

's basically performance-focused image ad . 're seeing lot interesting development . reach audience 3 billion people . stay tuned one . great . okay . wanted turn regulatory framework . think regulatory privacy headwind market like u.s. , example , ccpa coming california , impact google product perspective ? much impact seeing business far ? maybe one quick follow-up . looking longer term , google preparing evolving regulatory privacy landscape next couple year ? okay . scrutiny , frankly , nothing new google . want stay focused delivering incredible product service user .
