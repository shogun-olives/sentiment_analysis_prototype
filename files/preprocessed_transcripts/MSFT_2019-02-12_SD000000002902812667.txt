right . yes , exactly , 're ready go . thank , everybody , -- thank coming today . really want thank microsoft team coming may watching weather seattle , 've gotten hit ton snow last week . know herculean effort get . want thank julia white coming . 's corporate vice president azure marketing . 's u . 's always great session . really appreciate taking time . absolutely , yes . question answer guess thing get asked lot kind , transition ? go back year ago , five year ago , people would thought , 100 % workload -- well , everyone 's always optimistic -- would public cloud . depending stats look , 're far . market's growing aggressively . think transition ? yes . 's couple different angle -- mic , yes , hear ? couple different angle , would say , -- well , -- general , cloud adoption great . 's definitely growing . 're moving even kind late-stage adopter . percentage ip application built migrated , go cloud still pretty small . still lot go . company today workload 're migrating cloud , they're q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellinibuilding new cloud , 's still majority 're running . -- think couple thing changed . definitely moved seeing kind mid-tier early adopter moving cloud getting kind first workload cloud even late-stage adopter . think -- kind cycle customer type , 've definitely pushed even farther . interestingly , past year , 've conversation , really basic cloud conversation next wave adopter started come front . right . -- think workload azure , moved first ? guess think -- cohort , like mentioned , right ? early adopter , putting azure today n't year ago ? see uptake technology -- kind migration changing people able learn cohort ? yes . -- 's type adopter . yes . see -- overall tam azure public cloud , right , 's 2 thing . one application exist today migrate cloud net new application built . migration innovation , 2 basic way . go back , early , early cloud adopter innovation , like net new thing , n't lot . actually early azure workload came -- new mobile app , new system built . moved wave like , '' actually , get , cloud . 'm really going start migrating existing set , mission-critical , business area . '' 'd say , went back three year , migration workload looked like backup , disaster recovery , non-mission-critical line- of-business system . migration pipe good innovation pipe . 've kind normalized kind type tranche workload . within migration , 're seeing thing like sap , huge pipeline , like mission-critical system running azure . obviously , microsoft's running sap system azure proof point . definitely moved kind lower-tier , tier 2 type workload migration tier 1 . think front , balance innovation kind workload application migration , 's normalized , tell thing kind shaping whole market . level sophistication 's migrated also increased . 's still early . -- mean , n't know extent guy kind talk . give u way think , kind going path , like iaa versus paas penetration azure . meaning , azure workload , - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia whiteright , percentage would -- revenue , much would paas versus iaa ? like think like moving higher ? way think -- would encourage others think think workload , application customer using , right ? 's straight migration , 're going use core infrastructure , right ? even like couple year ago , people would say , `` 'm going migrate leave alone . '' n't actually meet customer talk like anymore . walmart great example . started migrating . 're like , `` n't anymore . modernize everything 're bringing see eﬃciencies get . '' say modernization , mean ? mean 'm using core infrastructure . 'm using thing like developer service , data service , managed service get greater eﬃciencies cloud well 're taking advantage talk , cloud-native service built beginning incredible scale , supereﬃcient , great user experience . 'd say -- overall pipeline , still lot people migrating infrastructure . almost immediately , modernization work happens . 's platform service data service start getting consumed . mean , 've involved business quite time . take look kind marketing message would help team create 're looking competitor kind going pro con competitive differentiation , look like today ? feel 're competing ? strength weakness talk ? yes . thing talk . also hear back customer 'd u talking . first , think hybrid , long time , huge differentiator belief compute distributed , public cloud distributed on-premises well . 's true talk hybrid data center cloud even move intelligent edge distributed compute . building consistency around area . certainly talk . next one would overall talk productivity . point view came -- , heritage , know customer varied range technology skill set technology team . built management tool , built developer tool , built policy people moving cloud , n't learn tooling . built-in . system . productivity message certainly resonates . last one actually -- really increasing around trust . 's trust security , compliance , privacy . accreditation attestation . mean , public cloud , certainly important . 's pivoted even farther trusted vendor transparent core competency , business we're , 're going turn around compete customer . that's q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne belliniobviously big theme hear market well term overall trusting microsoft partner . right . amy talked lot earnings call enterprise mobility included obviously azure line strength business . kind think maybe saas application 's running top . think type saas application ? reason care , typically higher gross margin , right ? think kind -- expand touch point within azure -- saas touch point within azure ? yes . -- enterprise mobility em set azure service sell sapplications , right . protect user device apps . kind package , really -- actually go market microsoft 365. great opportunity . area , mean , honestly , data service , really , think , follow class kind higher-level service . part azure business incredibly healthy . see ton opportunity class service . , 's customer moving cloud . one biggest problem 're trying solve around data estate operational data also analytical data . particularly , everyone ai strategy , everybody . , 're like , `` got use ai , got create ai application , system . '' , `` get always , like , dream ai . '' go , '' look , data , analytics system old rigid ... ai without data ? right . quickly pivot , like , `` oh , gosh , got work analytics , data warehousing , data lake . '' part cloud growth phenomenal 're going go -- 're going build ai , going build data estate analytics system on-premises . make sense . part , think , higher level service . right . probably n't hear much one earnings call . would seem like would one 's come term . ( technical diﬃculty ) little le em maybe given well guy done bit area . - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini yes . mean , think overall growth , em , , 94 million paid user , 's like huge business . phenomenal , love . point slow scale data service area azure -- 're still putting triple-digit number really big business . right . 's question come lot . 'm interested , perspective . investor , consternation every quarter whether azure growth -- whether 's 74 % 76 % , like lot market cap trade small difference percentage . know . amy reminds time . 'm sure . say people fixate specific number ? well important number . bad one pay attention -- 're going pay attention . keep perspective , right ? mean , azure massive business . way report also inclusive em part business well . per user , graduating growth aspect well . -- unpack behind number , incredible growth within . 've seen data service like triple-digit growth . huge - - huge new industry 're going . yes , business size , going see growth moderate . always feel bad -- internal review . high expectation . amy high expectation u . say , beating business multimillion-dollar business . 're growing 100 % . 'm like , `` god , happen ? '' try keep high-class problem . , . yes , 'm like , went business school , one taught grow multibillion-dollar business 100 % , yet . -- within dynamic . feel good couple thing . one , new business 're entering , whether analytics , 're going see next quarter additional place 're investing , new business 're crashing . mean , we've effectively got unlimited tam 're playing majority azure , right ? em per-user cap . iaa paas perspective ... - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia whitevery unlimited . 's operationalizing well , capitalizing well . yes , 'll see growth continue stabilize really high number though . internal benchmarking azure performance ? like -- -- know -- like determine , okay -- make amy happy ? certain benchmark look ? aws ' growth rate ? -- -- kind grading segment ? yes . obviously , 's triangulation different area . certainly , looking vendor growing rate time life cycle certainly one way look . looking size shape existing on-premises equivalency would fast moving . see early signal term ai going true , type data adoption need happening . working back see market signal perspective . 's looking 3. 's little bit arc obviously 're kind unlimited tam type business . -- every time think put aggressive number , amy kind push u little harder , job . keep trying . one question started come last month , guess , idea salesperson getting paid presell capacity . getting paid quota presell capacity . -- might kind area expertise . kind think go-to-market changed ? always told process getting paid pre-usage , right , changed year ago like salesperson focused consumption . -- share u kind go-to-market changed potentially -- compensation strategy changed ? yes . 3-year journey took sale force paid billed revenue . 's selling microsoft expired license azure commits purely paid consumption . kind graduated three year , 100 % based consumption -- microsoft salesperson paid azure , 's consumed revenue . -- customer chooses say , `` hi . want give $ 1 million upfront . 'll use next year , '' salesperson n't see $ 1 million quota . see get consumed year . 100 % true . company still obviously financially recognize customer chooses bill upfront . -- 's interesting , pulled done much field retraining , go build motion , get rid muscle memory go consumption . actually found customer like , q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia white '' , , actually kind like buy lock dollar . '' yes . 's actually customer ( technical diﬃculty ) ( feeling ) . course , 'll take money way . 's -- n't -- 's salesperson front line actually recognized . 's also incentivize compensate partner channel either . 's also consumed revenue . right , okay . wanted spend little bit time azure hybrid benefit , seems like , mean , guy uniquely positioned offer bring-your-own- license movement . talk u really started make way market feedback ? start see customer moment said , `` okay , great '' ? yes . context . azure hybrid benefit . 're window server sql server customer , , hybrid benefit -- microsoft azure , hybrid benefit allows basically run window , sql -- window server , sql server azure . n't repurchase ip . 's fantastic advantage -- kind give on-premises customer buyer window sql kind insurance plan people know want go cloud next generation . obviously , give azure wonderful price advantage term able run ip 've already bought . -- like ... go effect ? going say think 're second year oﬃcially program landed . -- took couple -- mostly 18 , 12 month ago really saw adoption ( craze ) . 's awareness , get . people buy . also , -- operationalized product . 're azure , go deploy virtual machine , say , `` hi . azure hybrid benefit ? '' also made really frictionless customer take advantage . 're seeing huge benefit on-premises licensing benefit add customer . also , pipeline window sql application migrating azure fantastic . mean , -- aspect , , azure hybrid benefit . also window sql server 2008 product 's going extended support . 's 10 year old . mean 's going mainstream support . customer faced 2 option . one , buy extended security update 75 % cost license move run azure get free . 's secondary q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia whitebenefit 2008 installed base , largest installed base ( space ) . right , right . -- pay per year stay -- stay saying want on-premise paying update ? 's 75 % ( inaudible ) three year . three year . , something ? get customer agreement , yes . okay , okay . yes , 's pretty road . general , like 's -- 's good -- 's good catalyst anytime -- 's actually different 's happening sap , right , everyone sap move hana 2025. huge catalyst people saying , `` okay , got ( touch ) sap system . going move hana ? going move cloud ? '' , 's -- see phenomenal pipeline around sap system moving azure think catalyst . 2008 extended support support security update another one . 2 big , big growth opportunity business . feel -- like n't talk specifically aws . feel 've closed functionality gap relative year ? think way ? . mean , customer -- 's -- 'd say 's reﬂected customer partner conversation , 's -- part think people say 're equal , right , 's analyst , 's customer . interesting thing customer go , like , '' oh , 're missing feature . know 're going soon enough . '' -- , `` aws missing feature . 'll probably get , . '' 's pretty normalized pure technology perspective . 's place materially different come . hybrid , category thing , bunch stuff ca n't touch . aspect like . , 's pretty normalized perspective . 's -- aws , obviously , first , 're q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia whiteleader . get benefit doubt . leading oﬃce 365 business , luxury . know 's like , hunt little harder azure side . see trust factor come lot . think one intangible . partner -- partner meeting morning like , `` hi . used work aws . n't . worry they're competing . '' 's ... come lot . real concern , right ? think 'm proud work 've done transparent plan , core competency , 're , 're , know 's -- 've 40 year build trust . know look like . used good bit window revenue run -- window workload running aws . -- like happens going forward ? mean , maybe became strong guy . -- 's trend window workload running aws ? find -- way kind shift workload back azure ? 'd say -- n't number obviously . see mine . pipeline ... must send check , right ? well yes , -- certain boundary ... yes , yes , okay . amy know . -- would say would shocked pipeline window sql better . despite bigger obviously , think phenomenal growth . , differentiated opportunity front . -- taking application cloud another one , honestly , place could spend lot time . competitive nature would want u . i'm like , white space tam business big , n't actually encourage salesperson focus lot energy . customer 's like , `` hi . ca n't trust aws , '' `` find better ( business ) , '' 'll say switch . q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini q - unidentified participant - julia whitenot necessarily place 'm actively hunting trying go pull . mean , aspect , , aws 's multi-cloud world . think 've expected . look on-premises today , 's heterogeneous . n't think cloud different . see people making different decision , `` hi . 'm going new innovation type cloud . i'm going migration cloud . '' -- 's really -- customer 's mindset part department application application . best breed , want -- kind spread estate across different vendor vendor control , vendor lock-in concern , lot different thing . even though 's -- customer might window sql application aws n't mean 're going put next one azure . 'll blended . expect continue true . take aws outpost ? yes . -- 's come little -- ( 's heartening ) . funny watch . would n't even say word hybrid 're -- like would literally say word . 'd like , `` 's weird . '' guess cloud , hammer hit nail . would n't talk hybrid five year . we've azure stack market two year , right . finally utter word hybrid -- 's outpost . even laugh little bit , name , like , outpost . like 're serious . sound like something , way named even , tell really feel . think interesting , 's azure stack , people -- trying compare . first , 's market . think 's year . 's definitely different azure stack , full kind integrated cloud system run locally . , see , look like kind platform layer service able run existing infrastructure kind managed way . 'll see turn . think 's kind like welcome -- welcome reality . customer hybrid , n't need hybrid . interesting see play . , 's different try fact hybrid offering versus build beginning . identity , data , management , hybrid . ... want see 's question audience 're -- oh , 's one . think 's mic runner . hold , 'll right . think 's perception guy strong large-scale enterprise many thing 've talked : hybrid , reliability , long-scale trust . positioning younger company , start-ups . 're relevant next generation company ? q - heather anne bellini q - unidentified participant - julia white q - unidentified participant - julia whiteyes . looked -- starting , let 's say , segmentation perspective , look azure business , 're actually equally distributed across small business , kind midsize enterprise large enterprise consumed revenue perspective . 's maybe balanced people might think . obviously strong enterprise . overall , , healthy small business well . feel great , feel great execution growth rate . actually think really strong smb kind web direct business , superstrong . -- specific question start-ups , couple different initiative , targeted start-ups . , reactor kind co-innovation center around world . also investment program provide start-ups money . resource . actually thing start-ups ( reach ) work u go market . come work u -- technology running azure , earn right able co-sold sale force , huge lever start-ups . 's -- obviously earn way level . idea could suddenly sold 50,000 microsoft salesperson across globe , 's pretty impressive . 're seeing lot strong demand specifically . go back couple year ago , u , aws , gcp , throwing bunch credit start-ups . think 're mostly burning money would move one program next program use credit leave . , much focused value-add -- 2-way value-add program start-ups specifically . feel good pipeline . obviously , 're b2b start-up , love u . 're b2c , n't quite much , global sale force n't necessarily focused . 's okay . question ? 's one back . sort detected bit pickup management whenever would talk fact microsoft offer solution -- n't compete customer . heather asked , essentially said n't go -- salesperson n't go chase kind customer . missing something ? n't hear well . one time . guess 'm trying ask , detected pickup tone management recently microsoft competing customer . ( see throughout ) amazon competing customer , whereas said really chase customer per se , amazon may competing . 's bit mismatch . 'm wondering missing ? 'll tell 'm seeing see answer question perhaps , would say thing like retailer financial service company health q - unidentified participant - julia white q - unidentified participant - julia whitecare , seeing amazon go business saying , `` gosh , going give money people competing ? '' money actually , deeper issue data , right ? 're running system cloud , sense data , information coming . 's information probably n't want share someone 's competing space . -- think 's thing see come often seeing like kroger walgreens , boot gap lot company moving actively azure distance basically feeding competition . maybe -- n't know answer question . ... mentioned diﬃculties converting ai strategy reality . 'm wondering , seeing -- takeup ai compute offering , actually everyone wanted say going use , actually , reality n't quite strong thought ? yes . -- mean , think 're -- lot technology ( height ) cycle , right ? everyone got excited ai . 're still excited . look executive briefing center , ai # 1 conversation customer want come u . tell index . people said , '' great , want ai , '' 're like , `` okay , well , -- 's 2 thing ai . '' there's model , ai model prebuilt , like prebuild data resource . like computer vision , detect shoe versus water bottle . use ai model application lot . 've seen lot adoption prebuilt model 'm building application , take advantage ai model . there's sophisticated , , `` 'm going build ai model power supply chain predict customer behavior . '' 's need get data science , 're going using specialized compute able process run kind algorithm high fidelity . 's much complicated conversation . tends start dream . n't data scientist , n't quite know want yet . tends much analytics , getting data science basic taking advantage compute available . 's kind 2 class prebuilt ai model use building capability around . plan end capacity ? wider question , plan capacity , yes , say 're seeing strong growth ? yes . 's lot science . 's combination , first , globally see demand signal . obviously lot lot model around predict demand 's going coming . also -- good visibility sale pipeline , direct field also q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia whitefrom partner , type application type workload people coming . like sap certain type compute know need -- pretty good sense need distributed . ai one 's , 's still early , 's little harder predict . one , probably perfect capacity utilization one 's early . 's big part ﬂeet either . 's kind specialized compute . 's like wildly make lot difference margin . 's one 's little bit harder . wanted ask container adoption interest serverless . customer saying ? yes . kind higher-level service , -- basically , simple way 's 2 class . 's data service . 's kind developer platform service . container serverless , talk , developer system . back application on-premises , migrate . migrate , first thing modernize move container . like world chosen kubernetes containerization -- using technology called kubernetes . go kubernetes conference , they're selling . mainstream average company , like 's gone elite tech everybody 's choice . absolutely next wave , core every modernization project 've seen . expect continue 're internally . think real trend . serverless , 's lot confusion around serverless really mean . people started talking event-driven . 's kind , thing like , hey , action happens , outcome , make another action . ( inaudible ) serverless basically paas work , right ? talk serverless , n't really say paas anymore . 's like anything n't require manage compute working storage underneath . come play 're modernization net new innovation application . think 's strong trend side thing . become deﬂationary extent ? went cloud 4 five year ago , deploying paas buying reserved instance , example , period might using . wanted make sure always available . move serverless , use need , right ? think deﬂationary aspect could cause someone 's iaa paas infrastructure , right , versus kind much could ignite even spending , right , additive create new use case new application ? yes . think would theoretically say , `` gosh , 's going deﬂationary everything 's going shift . 're going get supereﬃcient q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia whitehow use . '' n't see reality moving quite like . look -- , classify data developer service , data service growing incredibly hot . shift core infrastructure they're running -- 's going make data even 's kind deﬂationary developer high level . right . collective basis , 's net increase spending . depends 're allocating . right way ? yes . think -- 've gotten sophisticated serverless mean technology , 's different type , right ? thing like event-driven supereﬃcient customer perspective , low cost , awesome . hard run system event-driven technology , really hard , like really know 're build brand-new app , totally make work event-driven . 's many people planet really want . theoretically possible versus think actually going happen look little differently . 'll much balanced approach people -- people use technology . question -- saw standing . question ? , okay . saw mic runner . sorry . -- thomas kurian ceo google cloud earlier morning . wondering -- 're competitive analysis 're hearing feedback customer , gcp fit equation ? yes . like outside see . say almost every conversation customer partner aws , azure . 's -- expect every meeting every discussion . -- see gcp occasionally . mostly show -- like france , conversation , tend come -- , 'm reﬂecting . think anything else ... yes . microsoft view , customer telling ? yes . see , reality come -- could -- different way , maybe cmo adwords g suite kind buy gcp usage . 's kind roundabout way get account business . think 're early trying get enterprise win , 're going go business . 's see come . 's frequent , honest . 's geography , see place . q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini - julia white q - heather anne bellini okay . last question github role see github playing expanding developer audience . think github fit ? yes . 's microsoft level , right , term incredible developer resource , ten million developer hundred million repository wonderful open-source ecosystem . term microsoft developer relevancy , 's wonderful asset . 'll continue run independently , like 've seen u linkedin minecraft . independent capability decision-making autonomy , really important . deeply understand value . yet also see opportunity help customer . example , put offer together allows enterprise customer buy github enterprise microsoft licensing . n't -- there's big promotion . kind put . see incredible adoption , like customer begging 're -- github 's enterprise offering n't really done enterprise way , way microsoft , right . customer hungry . pretty simple thing , got easier , like , `` great , one thing . '' see great customer benefit natural aﬃnity , wonderful opportunity together , 're good heavy-handed ( jamming ) hazard anything nature . right , great . thank , julia . yes . appreciate . thanks , everybody . thank .
