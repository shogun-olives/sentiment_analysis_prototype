okay . think 're going go ahead kick . thank , everybody , coming . 'm tycho peterson life science team jpmorgan . today , interesting panel . chad robin adaptive biotechnology , one founder ; peter lee microsoft . question answer think kick , maybe 'll ask give little bit introduction . maybe , chad , talk little bit adaptive , role company play sequencing immune system important ? sure . tycho , thank u , appreciate . adaptive characterizes cell adaptive immune system precise exquisite level . attacker cell , pathogen come body . defender cell immune system . primary defender cell cell b cell . job , bind kill remember foreign perturbation come body . 's unique immune system cell dna actually rearranges . 're able we're able use next-generation sequencing technology characterize read dna exquisite level . goal vision adaptive translate precision scale immune system diagnose treat disease . first commercial product blood cancer . 's called clonoseq . 's measuring minimal residual disease able predict relapse whether cancer gone treatment . pipeline diagnostics related concept whether immune system competent - peter lee q - tycho w. peterson - peter lee - chad m. robinsnot . 'll save discussion partnership antigen mab peter introduction . great . let add thanks , 's really great . 'm thrilled great partnership adaptive biotechnology . 'm peter lee . 'm corporate vice president microsoft . run organization created satya nadella harry shum shortly satya took ceo . internally , called next . organization deep tie reach microsoft research . viewed kind internal venture fund supposed spark new project empower team disciplined investment process grow new product engineering team new line business microsoft . 's essentially mission . focus area traditionally silicon future , particularly silicon strategy technology data center , cloud also ai machine learning . long ago , satya nadella asked u take health care strategy microsoft . 've hunt smallest set partner really go deep research development really make difference world bring new product business idea fore . adaptive biotechnology really , much top mind incredibly thrilling important partnership u . want talk little bit partnership came ? obviously , 're based seattle . maybe 's history led adaptive search . want start ? sure . sure , get started . say long-term vision adaptive . spun fred hutchinson cancer research center 2009. founded company brother , harlan robin . -- long-term vision could use immune system diagnose disease , perhaps universal diagnostic many , many year . although took u probably close decade develop chemistry technology informatics led u believe possible . course last two year , put final piece together , 'll explain detail minute , link immune receptor pathogen bind getting functionality immune system receptor . led u say , hey , start filling map entire human adaptive immune system , call immunome . start filling chemistry . realized would take , sophisticated machine learning cloud compute power truly get problem able impact patient care . set started talking variety different partner big data , large market cap , machine learning expert . think assumption went discussion change based partner - peter lee q - tycho w. petersonthat wound talking . microsoft deep commitment , really putting resource . 'm talking financial resource term investment , 'm talking resource commitment fte perspective . capability , team . incredible synergy member team level . starting peter , happen season ticket , couple seat away seahawks , scientist level , technology level even board level . connection point . kind massive commitment say 're -- 're right , 're long term . want make cornerstone . peter convinced . many discussion executive leadership team , team microsoft , going cornerstone microsoft genomics effort could differentiate strategy based going tractable problem , differentiating around immunomics sequencing adaptive immune system . deal work several month . think could n't -- echo peter's comment , could n't trilled microsoft partner . yes . got lot done halftime seahawks game . think , perspective microsoft , reason world health care ? 's huge , vast ocean . fact , joked satya nadella asked u take , felt like threw u middle pacific ocean ask u find land . mean , go ? quickly -- microsoft , quickly start focus , well , cloud ai matter . start take discussion possible precision medicine future fundamental technology . quickly get genomics space omics space . course , big player already . n't fully kind rationalize reason space . started ask question , well , could really kind go deep best-in-class really gain confidence space . got u broad-ranging discussion . one thing rose top , interesting scientific commercial work going , generally speaking , around immune system . actually , microsoft research , interaction harlan robin scientist adaptive biotechnology fred hutch . relationship fred hutch gave u insight . one thing led another . consistently led adaptive biotechnology leader space . started interact , arrived , incredibly beautiful -- perspective , incredibly beautiful -- scary big . incredibly beautiful machine learning problem really directed focused way lot engineering finance engineering excellence , could really solve important problem . really went . left chad get creative deal structure . chad mentioned , took month got done . maybe let 's look ahead little bit think 's vision collaboration . think ultimately could mean patient end day ? - chad m. robin - peter lee let give longer-term vision . let 's back tangible near-term milestone think 's important separate 2. longer- term vision based blood test based understanding immune receptor antigen 're binding diagnose multiple disease one time . think -- think immune system -- project , 's x-ray immune system molecular stethoscope . get eventually . 's currently agency , fda payer community work . shorter term , want break going call low-hanging fruit , unmet medical need , disease extremely hard diagnose either slow , invasive . 're done rule-out test . let 's take multiple sclerosis , 're 50 test determine n't settling disease diagnosis . rule-in test , know molecular level . immune receptor combination immune receptor , immune receptor specific antigen bind antigen specific disease , know potentially diagnose disease . think area , hard-to-diagnose auto immune disease certain chronic pathogen perhaps . 'm using example 're coming prioritization matrix disease state want diagnose first . think thing like lyme disease , even cancer space , look high-risk population , would narrow . would n't say , hey , let 's go general screen first . would say , let 's target brca-positive , 40-year-old- plus woman ovarian cancer , whereas diagnosis stage 4 fatal . able diagnose earlier stage , 's kind massive patient benefit . yes , 's really kind think . also think , though , look screen biological system , x-ray mri , n't initially indicated screen system , 're indicated specific use . believe . look forward working partner , microsoft . working agency , working payer community education , kind time , layer diagnostic diagnostic diagnostic , ultimately , get screen entire system . actually , 'll leave , i've got couple comment . ... well maybe add question partnership work . 2 -- least 2 component , important one . one working together develop technology , advance science develop technology . part , business arrangement . 2 important thing 've put lot thought . technology side , roughly speaking , think 3 component . one data , ideally , label training data , super ideally , hell lot . 's really important . extremely impressive adaptive biotechnology large amount labeled unlabeled data also ability really high throughput way generate labeled data , super important . second algorithm machine learning . 's something 're proud , capability contribution . go half silicon valley startup trying kind imaging , large , 'll running resnet 50 , came directly lab . much , much sophistication cloud q - tycho w. peterson - chad m. robin q - tycho w. peterson - chad m. robin - peter leescale bring bear . ideally , put 2 thing together , get model , machine learning model , give basic ai intelligence . almost perfect working relationship 's data , 's algorithm turning model diagnostic tool technology go back adaptive biotechnology . think 's , nice comfortable clean setup . business side , 're trying everything keep clear simple respect intellectual property , respect go- to-market , respect adaptive 's future business prospect success , try keep thing clean clear . liberates engineering development team unencumbered complication , focus get work done . think one advantage , think , assay technology ability look retrospective data set . something leverage partnership ? absolutely . one thing -- 've designed assay able characterize retrospective sample . think 's huge advantage u develop training set data . scale . quickly . technical term , look sample stored especially cancer setting formalin fixation , ffpe sample , -- assay work ffpe . n't need fresh sample , use dna analyte . 's many , many different reason move rapidly develop really massive quantity data peter team apply machine learning algorithm , hopefully get u answer quicker . think time line ? think maybe initial milestone , ultimately , commercialization around initial disease state , far ? couple year ? look first set diagnostics kind 3 four year ' time line . think concept universal diagnostic working agency payer community probably decade . think one comment microsoft really great partner u commitment shipping product . 've already commercialized first diagnostic . diagnostics pipeline related immune competence . keen mega moonshot say , hey , maybe 10 year later , 're going something . believe 's tractable problem make significant headway several disease diagnostics short term . short term 3 ; 4-year time horizon . term shipping product , may 2 comment make . one scale machine learning problem 're talking literally web q - tycho w. peterson - chad m. robin - peter leescale . 's fairly daunting prospect . 's unknown u . team done huge amount machine learning foundational work actually present bing search engine , example . 're confident ability . also cognizant fact get level scale , start first day addressing ensuring level kind engineering precision excellence . ca n't bolt later . term innovation process , speaking purely manager , nice thing guarantee , first day , thinking term product shipping quality . super important . thing say , remember microsoft , part cloud ai imperative 's also part trying think role broadly genomics space . sort activity really give u also broader kind reason exploring thing . led u partnership investment . also entered agreement g & nexus , example , including investment . already see , partnership also lead kind sparking innovative idea . way , 's almost perfect u . think organization , sort awe-inspiring moonshot universal blood test . 's super inspiring , attracts talent like crazy , time , see prospect steady stream intermediate product coming pipe . time career situation combination quite like . maybe could touch regulatory reimbursement side thing . alluded earlier . 's evolving landscape . panel earlier week dual pathway . 've seen foundation exact go successfully . 'm curious , start think payer engagement think regulatory side thing , ? sure . ca n't start , either regulatory payer engagement , early enough . 'll say . say diagnostics industry challenging fact universal payer coverage . 've got government payer coverage , medicare , medicaid . go kind one one private payer side 's tech assessment body , et cetera . 's complex web navigate . said , 're encouraged , think , dual-track pathway , next-generation sequencing , natural coverage decision 're referring medicare . really mentality around fda thinking problem , last year , kind new -- scott gottlieb helm , incredibly , think , impressive . 're also seeing payer side well willingness engage dialogue earlier previously . take lot . concept -- think 's 2 component challenging concept . one , alluded earlier kind screen biological system molecular level . 's challenging concept . also think -- end day , -- immune system beautiful system able . think -- , think 's early engagement . 're encouraged . 're counting guy , . - chad m. robin q - tycho w. peterson - chad m. robin - peter lee q - tycho w. peterson lot challenge . think kind practical implication patient perspective , data interpretation , treatment paradigm ultimately look like patient 're getting diagnosed earlier ? think side , early diagnosis ? potentially , may established treatment paradigm area . yes . think 's great question . guess simply put going information . think certain disease state , high-risk disease state , 's clear unmet medical need . clear kind translation information actionability . clearly , diagnose certain cancer earlier , take information cut tumor , start treatment earlier . think clearly , certain autoimmune disorder , information earlier , could get right treatment . go concept precision personalized medicine say let 's get right treatment right patient right time . certain area fraught kind political consideration question . frankly , think perhaps stay away first -- information sake worrying people , 'm sure place start . 's -- unless 's treatment something , think start area first there's kind clear clinical utility , clear actionability . thing develop , new medicine develop , talk layering additional diagnostics . yes . little bit tangent . 've actually -- one conversation chad several time pertains research development program thing going target first rationale . -- talk machine learning folk , certain criterion certain way thinking , thing come biology side . also third component , business side need creative inventive cognizant regulatory landscape . sort want framework 're taking account 3 thing order frame decision process target , priority order focus team way . 's ongoing discussion , think , going give u lot insight . one thing also , 're conference like one , 'm sure 's much . even get earful stakeholder suggestion thought , targeting thing early . sort input . think 'll interesting time trying decide basically priority list . - peter lee q - tycho w. peterson - chad m. robinscan talk little bit type data 're going collecting ? think 're also collecting phenotypic data , outcome data . think data side ? right . 's -- already interesting data set adaptive access term antigen , term blood bank sample , blood bank sample correlated specific disease state . technology take naive sample , inoculate , way , generate remarkably high rate new label data set . think thing combination labeled unlabeled training data corpus . one thing 've instructed assume much knowledge machine learning . put simply , machine learning , way 're conceiving , deep learning paradigm , 2 phase : training phase inference execution phase . data asset adaptive able create give u gold mine first training phase . 're able even unlabeled data set start automated feature extraction large scale . informative drive accuracy inference whatever diagnostic application come . kind data privilege hand , , important whole program , least machine learning side . one thing wanted say . culture agility . microsoft , get lot partnership grand plan extract insight data . probably , many organization represented room also . generally speaking , decision made go thing , get frustration delay overcome technological , regulatory strategic hurdle actually get data hand data scientist machine learning researcher . thing found exciting , literally , within 2 hour signing partnership agreement , adaptive significant data set hand machine learning researcher . think within 2 hour , pretty deep question back adaptive . level agility , , reinforce reality significant data asset work . patient consent perspective ? mean , need patient kind opt development path ? panel yesterday 23andme , talked high level patient engagement 've kind gone path drug development . level consent payer -- patient process ? well 's 2 different stage data development generation . first , term -- actually buy massive leukopaks , basically drain people blood . create huge pool naive receptor , transfect challenge different antigen presentation , basically disease pathogen bind . use sophisticated suite technology start filling map . n't need patient consent . secondly , ... - peter lee - chad m. robin q - tycho w. peterson - chad m. robin q - tycho w. peterson way , let interrupt . want say one thing , first , u u 're learning 's language lingo . one thing never get comfortable , hope , lingo draining someone 's blood . wanted get straight . n't ( toggle ) , buy , although -- many experiment early day . -- secondly , 're going sequence well-characterized disease state . example , one data set 're targeting women's health initiative . 30 year well-characterized data clinical data associated underlying molecular data set . patient ' consent - - many , many case , patient consent already done u . said , 's clearly area general counsel legal make sure kind right consent . anything prospectively , absolutely make sure patient consent able work . therapeutic angle potentially around discovery leveraged drug development partner ? ... absolutely . 's hope . think first step pharma biotech company better understand therapy impacting patient . think , actually , good time mention . think relates timing question , 's important note , already developed delivery mechanism able perform test . 's really 2 component . one creating massive map , cross attacker cell defender cell cell receptor antigen . 's like huge vlookup table excel . second component patient walk doctor 's oﬃce get blood drawn sequenced . 've already developed perfected course eight year bulletproof technology sequence patient's immune receptor . , idea map receptor massive data table , knowing receptor 2 , 18 9 billion , , correspond . specific , say , let 's take lyme's disease . think give u kind head start say , hey , n't theoretical exercise . map created , 's truly matter leveraging core technology . tycho , question think answered ? 'll go back . risk diagnosis , labeling healthy individual patient due false positive ? think aspect situation immune system naturally correct n't necessarily need intervention ? think process ? - chad m. robin - peter lee q - tycho w. peterson - chad m. robin yes . 've lot discussion . 's better question harlan engage . think -- first , 're lot work right . think 's lot dogma field happens incorrect . think immune -- let 's take immune system property begin . maybe kind back question . immune system actually best natural diagnostic , right ? 's job take small perturbation amplify signal , okay ? aspect : 's highly specific , 's highly accurate 's highly systemic . able pick -- 's localized reaction . able pick blood . question whether -- 's different type immune system cell . go different stage term immune cascade . question whether immune reaction 're picking early that's leading incorrect treatment decision , think jury still whether immune system actually level -- 're able pick , believe 's already done job . actually disease . 's really -- computer science perspective , really interesting question one thing 'll mostly anxious learn . one thing deep neural net turn n't actually get black white answer , yes answer . get confidence level signal strength , codified term neural activation deep neural net structure . case get , yes , 100 % lyme 's disease , get 97 % confidence 's lyme disease . 's also possible get conﬂicting signal thing . exactly common information taken diagnostic regime think actually one interesting aspect . one steady thing realize machine learning model little bit like living entity . data feed , clarity ultimate signal get . also evolving point . way , another element think exciting thinking sort deeply embedded artificial intelligence tool , entering regime kind accuracy precision answer given tool evolves ideally improves time . ultimately see immune screening technology universal panel side , settling ? primary preventative screen ? something patient selection clinical trial ? mean , see ultimately use case universal test ? , think 's matter time horizon breaking kind tangible milestone time . think goal would checkup doctor 's oﬃce , every time go blood drawn would immune system sequenced . think way , tycho , immune system know -- disease doctor - peter lee - chad m. robin - peter lee q - tycho w. peterson - peter lee q - tycho w. petersondoes . 've talked -- field , 've talked cancer immunotherapy term harnessing power immune system kind fight cancer . really immunodiagnostic , 's really 're harnessing power immune system diagnose disease . able tell , doctor . 's see going , longer term kind -- shorter term start kind layering disease diagnostics , think 'll kind specific different disease state . , hard diagnose autoimmune disorder chronic pathogen , high-risk cancer patient , et cetera . 's matter letting data -- 're extremely data-driven company . high- powered machine learning data partner . truly matter letting data drive tell u actually capable . ( sure love ) concept blood test everyone take every year , talk way clearly drive cloud consumption . think 's simple u . 's also going good patient . indeed . pater , maybe talk little bit tool microsoft disposal developed brought partnership ? right . 've mentioned , well , big part team internal investment silicon innovation , silicon strategy . might familiar fact microsoft -- fact , cloud business rapidly evolving silicon computing fabric cloud . 're entering -- refer post-cpu era silicon scaling hitting certain limit . infrastructure , looking ahead future , likely become important kind workload 're contemplating . customized asics , reconfigurable computing fabric . thing embedded network infrastructure cloud , global data center , thing , think , going end -- meet amount success , 'll approaching scale thing important . already see within microsoft , example , bing search engine . use bing north america , may notice . web search result ranked entirely network data center , computing core , data center blade . happens whole host technical reason driven scale . 're really contemplating scale adaptive . - chad m. robin - peter leeas think way partnership structured , room expand time ? think partnership evolving ? -- ( inaudible ) disease area ? absolutely . mean , think , first foremost , structure partnership microsoft allowed u keep asset together making investment parent company . top , providing resource commitment term people expertise , think , , important . second , look size problem dollar 's going take able truly solve , 're partially funded . depending result see . 'll let speak term kind additional road interest kind moving forward greater scale . -- absolutely , 've really looking long-term partnership . -- look assessment criterion . one reason chose microsoft partner long-term orientation around . actually n't know true cost 's going take sequence entire immune system . start filling puzzle make significant headway . issue actually asked earlier , able use technology retrospective sample , 're able fraction cost technology strategy going early detection , example . 're talking low hundred million dollar opposed billion dollar . 's meaningful term cost perspective also term timing perspective , way , dovetail question kind false positive issue bringing . start looking -- one reason look -- example , looking peripheral mutation -- look cancer genomics , run kind large-scale prospective clinical trial , part relation type sample type technology work . signal-to-noise problem , whereas 're really trying catch disease earliest state , tumor shed enough stuff , peripheral mutation , able pick . 're truly looking -- needle haystack problem . said , really hope company solve 's great patient population . also want say technology potentially complementary , right ? 're looking genomics cancer versus host response body 's responding cancer . 'm bringing case cancer think large- scale effort underway cancer . , 've mentioned throughout discussion today , think 's important note getting immune system , , business perspective patient perspective , think 's one largest addressable kind opportunity cut across autoimmune disorder , infectious disease , cancer , even kind neurological disorder , depression allergy thing may might -- may think ( remediated ) , mounting evidence across large body publication show many disorder remediated . , think 'll let data drive really interesting problem . q - tycho w. peterson - peter lee q - tycho w. peterson q - unidentified participant - chad m. robinswhat tend tell people cost something like , real ai system , infinity . reason , fundamentally learning system . let 's take simple example . let 's take microsoft translator , language translation . 's never done . infinite amount engineering always improve quality , say , english russian russian chinese . always integrate data . always improve algorithm . fact , model . real question n't much much cost done . point start able recoup investment get ahead . -- 're sort ai regime , really fundamental question . need -- need kind analytical throttle element investment order ensure glide path point 're able get ahead ongoing cost -- march towards intelligence . guess , think output venture may , certainly , kit panel assay , guess microsoft 's perspective , software opportunity think interpretation either part physician reference lab ? yes . think , first , -- , pure computer science perspective , beautiful thing machine learning algorithm generally broad application . obviously , , -- blinker , 're focused specific problem adaptive brought u . recognize lot experience algorithm likely much broader application . train always open minded possibility . arrangement , intellectual property portfolio adaptive remains complete clean , still give u opportunity look new application . 's really important element . look microsoft relevant become competent broadly genomics space ? great partner give u chance get competent . give u chance learn , learn good . lot faith become good , open opportunity invest yet broader set area genomics space . think 'll open question audience , -- one . microphone ? okay . part question answered last dialogue . first question , thought looking biomarker well ? start giving drug diagnosed cancer , keep looking cell receptor see going ? q - unidentified participant - chad m. robin q - unidentified participant - chad m. robin - peter lee q - tycho w. petersonabsolutely . matter fact , 're today . part battery assay -- 'm sorry , test around concept immune competence , partnered 85 biotech pharma company , many around immuno-oncology space , autoimmune disorder space , et cetera . one thing we're looking , specifically look different level drug impact clonality really immune system . provide informative information patient treated . technology developed last couple year bind receptor antigen really , 're starting understand characterize functionality receptor . back earlier question kind know diagnosis 's binding , potentially use immune receptor therapeutically ? obviously , space started cellular therapy within oncology cancer car space . effort underway using naturally occurring tcrs try move field working blood cancer working solid tumor . think quite bit hope information amount data 're collecting work pharma 's chance able help pharma company better understand drug 're impacting patient ultimately clinician change treatment decision based immune system information . able hopefully able use immune receptor therapeutic context well . one question could even ... like back school , like 27 part ? , well , 's one thing might want look think 's huge need . neuromuscular space , -- 's hard find biomarkers . 's good enough reason believe lot neuromuscular disease immune component cell component actually , specific cell , 'm imagining 'll specific cell receptor . diagnosis tough also biomarker . people able run clinical trial biomarkers find . 's one exciting space look 's huge need . thank . great . anyone else ? q - unidentified participant - chad m. robin - peter lee - chad m. robin q - tycho w. peterson - peter lee - chad m. robinsdoes partnership cover nascent drug development work ? option ? 's currently contemplated partnership . 're -- think something like , -- actually , reason 'm ( hanging ) every leader within microsoft probably approach little bit differently . , 's important 're trying drive innovation process get early win quickly . , , dictate level focus would -- think would , least side , push pretty hard . start really understand , 're able work , well together lot agility , might feel freer kind expand space collaborative possibility . 's something dictate . typically situation , guess , go another seahawks game figure way hash . 's sort kind push pull . something 've appreciated partnership specifically chad kind easy level transparency kind sharing philosophy , concern , get u excited . good . absolutely . question audience ? okay . 'll conclude . want thank taking time today . congrats partnership . thank much . thank . appreciate .
