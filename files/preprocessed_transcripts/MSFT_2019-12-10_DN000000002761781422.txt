good morning everyone . thanks . 'm jen lowe . cover u software group ubs . takeshi numoto , cvp cloud marketing microsoft , thank u today . thank . maybe jump , might helpful set stage , could give u quick overview role microsoft , fall purview ? basically , 'm responsible worldwide go-to-market -- directly responsible many microsoft cloud product including azure , business application including dynamic 365 , power platform think get talk later today . well developer tooling product like visual studio . sort product 'm directly responsible term marketing responsibility . also sort think horizontal responsibility term call business planning , packaging , pricing licensing , sort entirety microsoft commercial product portfolio including microsoft 65 oﬃce 65 window . well call global demand center , basically marketing operation commercial business microsoft . 's -- sort direct product responsibility two horizontal responsibility . takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numotogreat . maybe sort dig area responsibility , starting high level , one biggest question , think , year people trying figure 's going broader environment . see headline seem negative macro , company like microsoft , maybe even microsoft particular , seem continue , well . talk quickly demand trend 're seeing ? meet customer , feeling plan , anything ? yeah , mean course , n't think company business claim immune macro trend . least market participate , 're still seeing really strong momentum . think energy conversation get customer , particularly relates cloud journey , energy intensifying . coming perspective save money drive productivity also use cloud catalyst transforming business moving business forward . , generating lot engagement customer driving lot consumption cloud . , , 're really seeing sort dampening demand -- market participate . see - - feel like 're right sort place right time secular growth trend standpoint . maybe round point , one debate , n't know 's either maybe relative weighting , pod offer lot advantage . 's strategic advantage agility able new thing . 's also thing like cost saving , moving capex opex , kind decision . conversation equally weighted strategic forward thinking versus trying drive cost ? one maybe dominant shifting ? really . think 's sort -- 's really , equally weighted . think lot migration discussion , lot customer start cloud journey thinking migration way save cost , drive productivity , maybe increase agility . rich history thing like window server sql server , basically get provide big economic advantage , 're basically 5x cheaper example , versus aws lot migration scenario . set entry point customer start . another set customer start far , yeah , really want innovate , change business process , get new business process new -- innovating new application using cloud native technology . often time , lot conversation start migration sort lead , think innovation agenda . cost customer , sort plan time much strategic partnership jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowewith microsoft basically say , hey , really want cloud journey partner i'd partner deeply migration innovation side 's continuing drive much larger top deal . great . maybe following , mean azure star performer microsoft number year . 're seeing scale get bigger bigger bigger , 're still -- growth rate 's still hovering around 60 % , pretty fantastic . perspective , start , term azure adoption ? still early , mid-cycle , late ? far along ? much could potentially go ? term sort journey cloud , still believe 're early inning lot opportunity ahead . -- even think opportunity pipeline , see -- continue see tremendous amount growth . think 've seen amy talk increasing number large deal get trend n't seem declining . think 're still early . maybe focus large deal point since something amy call specifically last earnings call . diligence space couple year ago , would hear aws getting big megadeals . microsoft getting , case , n't even want megadeals composition service . look deal , big deal , tend -- ? mean still pretty compute storage heavy ? starting see premium service type deal ? maybe contrasting couple year ago maybe deal n't profitable viewed , profitable would like potentially profitable , start look different look differently way drive cost increase portfolio ? mean , profitability standpoint , think q1 , commercial cloud microsoft overall , microsoft cloud commercial gross margin , think 66 % , 4 point improvement year-over-year , large part driven improvement azure . that's area continue improve , particularly scale start realizing eﬃciencies infra investment 've already made . u 's sort ongoing , sort subject focus u something 'll continue plug-in . seeing far larger deal think also line larger market trend , customer look use cloud much aggressive way . takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numoto jennifer swanson loweand maybe within -- like year ago maybe 18 month ago , satya used talk premium service growing significantly better -- azure overall . presumably , 's continued . yeah , mean , think overall revenue mix , true sort compute storage network sort , would think infrastructure piece big chunk . growth rate standpoint , premium service , whether data service , ai , iot , analytics , security , certainly outgrowing core growth rate perspective significant amount . maybe drilling , premium service encompass lot , ai huge focus , 've also seen data point suggesting momentum around database cloud different ﬂavors . security obviously big focus . area particular seem resonating customer performing lot better maybe 12 month ago ? additional detail would interesting . well , certainly data service continue accelerate , whether -- think documented third party benchmark data , whether look multitude giga published data example , whether database side relational database side also analytics side data warehouse , seeing u able deliver substantial price performance benefit customer 's translating customer lead , engagement therefore consumption , 's one area . we've actually additional announcement build momentum . ignite , announced new service called azure synapse , really synapse analytics basically taking next step data warehouse able handle unstructured structured data comprehensive workbench -- 's getting great customer feedback . ubs stage earlier yesterday , one vmware [ ph ] obviously said publicly 've got big commitment microsoft . one thing strong point view , start move application cloud , negative concept lift shift said , lift shift n't work . bring . refactor . otherwise , 're going issue . provider azure , seeing company successfully make transition move application ? lot lift shift ? seeing new workload development ? consuming premium service rebuild takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowetheir application ? -- seems like big focus . seeing play perspective ? yeah , think customer really want plan estate overall think multiple piece . application want migrate , lift shift get driving eﬃciency infrastructure getting nightmare headache may on-prem . one element . also aspect , hey , develop , modernize infrastructure , develop new application come picture well . n't think 's one , time customer think able take advantage side . one point made learning skill set around refactoring application modernizing bringing , said first painful . -- obviously , incentive say 've learned lot 's going really well , think . said got first , got lot easier , could start bringing , go faster , 've got muscle built . -- going back adoption curve , -- look customer , many think kind hitting , 've got muscle , 's executing versus still learning phase even first place ? well , think every customer 's journey somewhat unique , particularly 's also function , think , oftentimes cohort like given customer start cloud journey customer well end year . 've gotten quite deep customer still early year . think come result different prospect different customer . seeing though notion , acquired cloud skill actually want extend inclusive ability manage on-prem environment place . 's 've gotten much interest hybrid multi-cloud investment announced ignite around call azure arc , sort collection technology 've learned manage set policy resource azure , board , on-premise resource resource cloud sort bring control plane azure , manage set policy consistent way . 's gotten lot interest , partially enough customer base actually skilled enough azure , able want extend skill set manage environment . 's good segue one thing want talk , particular azure arc . 've seen google announced anthos well . takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numotomean start put context around , would sort compare contrast 're looking -- maybe compare contrast . let 's talk -- n't want put spot talk much anthos , 'm sure 're familiar . think people trying understand , like anthos ? something different ? would sort describe arc fit multi-cloud strategy ? think way 're even asking question quite indicative , 's like player think -- approach hybrid often equated one product . aws hybrid often equated outpost google hybrid equated one offering called anthos . u , hybrid always huge differentiator think holistically identity management , security even database technology , developer tool . 's much comprehensive thing 's one thing . arc one thing sort term able set , manage resource service consistent way . , think sort overall posture aperture , different . aws , perception 're focused managing resource . outpost piece hardware buy aws else use 's , ca n't run aws service customer 's existing hardware . always connected controlled aws . support thing like regulatory environment governance issue want run thing disconnected phase , ca n't . 's sort focused approach essentially aws resource . google , see much focused container whereas customer everything run container , customer need run virtual machine , need manage server . approach comprehensive -- reﬂecting sort year investment made space . guess one question people always try figure , 're -- came old generation technology , basically predicated , people platform , never want leave . 've moved world , people leave . want convince stay . guess think building business model , get comfortable idea come -- 'll stay sort making thing like arc work way n't run risk getting price war -- make people stay ? think area stickiness ? actually u openness key portion want continue attract customer trust platform . , even support container arc , support one container , support many container , whereas anthos example requires use gke . like u , think ability jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numoto jennifer swanson loweable broad open-tented actually huge customer value proposition , one enables u attract customer . great . maybe sort extending side hybrid world , looking on-prem business , think one thing continued surprise positively ongoing strength traditional licensing business everyone assumed 's either 're seeing , fantastic . 'd curious get perspective , people still buying on-prem license ? point becomes incompatible continue see growth seeing azure still grow on-prem business ? well , u , one thing helpful construct business customer notion azure hybrid benefit . fact buy license excessively optionality option value able essentially consume service cloud discounted rate . basically essentially helped u encouraged customer continue renew software license also pave way use azure natural linear way . 's worked really great u way basically keep balancing growing side . factor service business increase premium mix . talked premium mix service sense , 're seeing software sense well . instead window server standard increasingly customer window server data center 're using virtualization technology running virtualized machine node essentially drive premium mix see thing sql server sql server enterprise edition mix going 's also helping revenue side well . sort server -- server software license revenue side , two set temporal impact sense 've end service support sql server 2008 , happened earlier year sort prompted , set purchase may durable . 've also -- think q1 last quarter github on-prem acquisition , github on- prem revenue sort recounted towards software license last quarter 's baseline . moving forward , , normalize little bit . okay . maybe double-click hybrid use benefit , customer look take advantage program look way get comfortable buying today vision future , 's sort horizon ? mean people buying view , hey , maybe five year move takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowecloud , want ﬂexibility ? bit immediate spectrum ? 'd curious see . , think whole sort -- benefit actually quite durable sense want run window server sql server , way pay ip even cloud continue renew software assurance 's kind balance 've struck . , think hybrid benefit sort impact quite durable time . okay , okay . maybe switching another part business , another reporting unit . power platform something fall purview , 's lot different piece . 's lot new announcement . maybe high level , power platform ? know encompasses lot , maybe start , sort carved distinct entity ? great . powerful platform comprises product like power bi , power automate , per virtual bot , released recently power apps . product characterized would call deep support effectively power user citizen developer . think application need world , believe next five year , application created , perhaps last 40 year . think tech company , actually developer hired outside tech company tech company . need grow application support different business process front-line issue going explode . scarce resource non-tech company hire term professional developer capacity really leveraged . power apps , powerful platform unique sense enables sort power user develop application , subject matter expertise closest business process , closest business issue develop application really address need , also basically leveraging scarce professional developer capacity every organization two work tandem , 's one key differentiation power platform kind so-called code , low code product platform , also -- built way 's synergistic deep professional developer capability microsoft provides azure . one -- think one attractive aspect power platform seems pretty easy use , pretty end user-centric . go build see demo , think could . probably could n't least pretend could . -- much designed appeal user , user may may ultimate takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numotodecision-maker whether something purchased . -- sell organization ? -- 's -- well , buyer ? well , talking buyer , think 's actually really important talk earn usage . one first thing make -- give -- maximizes opportunity end user become familiar power platform product many capability seeded oﬃce 65. every -- oﬃce 65 come basic capability power app power automate , people start automating basic task within oﬃce 65 environment basically create simpler application using sharepoint example . really get customer end user going sort inducted use , easy use capability start building application . essentially allows u sort say whether 's central say , hey , wealth usage , 's happening . would like essentially create business application last mile application using way that's highly manageable , 's one central sale motion , -- 's successful many place . case go talk line business say okay well , 're really trying help given front-line sort subject matter expertise problem 's help collection think departmental sale well centralized sale . sort synergistic basically . think data point 's 2.5 million user power platform currently . understand , lot sort happens -- mean purchase decision , talked , sort made certain level organization , people sort organically come build . sort point sort get ﬂywheel going ? people discovering product ? someone sort providing education getting people familiar , value ? people sort build excitement get program going drive adoption ? well , guess like multiple entry point . example sort , recall history power bi example , power bi first power platform product . really built momentum based lot customer trying service web free 've built -- strong community , essentially software perpetuated . product excitement , think building dashboard sharing . one way really took . fact also created offering oﬃce 65 e5 included power bi also sort essentially tried create end user excitement sale motion little bit traditional oﬃce 65 sale motion piece . jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numoto jennifer swanson loweand think newer power platform product like power automate power apps , lot coming organic usage first foremost within oﬃce 65 tenant customer start using effectively limited version power automate power apps , come oﬃce 65 subscription . get usage going sophisticated scenario give u opportunity upsell fuller version product . okay . since touched , automate capability . got technology around virtual agent rolled . would seem little bit sophisticated power -- mean power bi actually little bit ai-ey . guess -- 's company build whole practice around automating functionality . guy made sort easy consume . see microsoft 's role within market like rpa ? want market ? see area make sense area pure play innovate ? kind come together ? think -- tend go horizontal broad market , always room different player add value top targeted solution given industry given business process 's kind existed forever different market even think history oﬃce . think 's different . one key advantage bring table versus sort traditional low-code -- no-code , low-code kind tooling , , , start something want something really sophisticated , kind hit brick wall , redo app using different set tech . power platform built natively underlying capability azure . want go beyond power app platform product , synergistic path basically dip sort unlimited ﬂexibility azure provides extend ability without redoing application . talked earlier -- important element creating synergy basically citizen developer , power user essentially subject matter expertise using application solve problem , able work closely synergistically professional developer essentially deliver azure based solution apis consumed power apps power platform product general . okay . great . still bunch , know 've already got couple question audience . maybe 'll ask one , people want send , 'll look , . maybe around dynamic . guess , assume -- think going back history great plain microsoft way back history microsoft application space . takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowe ask satya . 'm sure 's . maybe sort look today , -- story last 18 24 month feel different traditional story microsoft application . look today , see natural fit microsoft ? clearly partner sap strong relationship enterprise space sap running azure . traditionally , 's middle-market oriented , also see large organization using microsoft . 's natural home dynamic ? really looking win product ? well mean microsoft business larger $ 1 billion , growing well 40 % , get somehow sort talked needing find place , 's already large business , saas business growing 41 % year-over-year . 's pretty substantial 're really excited . worth noting journey 've gone , think dynamic old great plain , solomon , navision , axapta sort -- also homegrown , microsoft homegrown crm product . 're - - assumption much on-prem . starting dynamic 65 , sort put journey making capability natively cloud based , natively azure based , cloud application also unifying application . actually suite saas offering worked well together manage different business process , whether 'd marketing sale commerce operation finance made consume piece want , also extend . actually get full picture expand business process covered saas application . whole strategy shift think really catalytic driving much accelerated growth . okay . great . couple audience , 'll hit . , 's others , feel free send . one around capex buildout azure . huge wave capex invested couple year ago . seems bit run rate . think people gotten data point different supplier thing may -- hyperscalers may buying le . obviously , guy seem feel pretty good 're seeing . maybe could talk little bit -- might fall -- fall little bit outside focus , . -- think process capex buildout azure , sort change look , investing . extent , fall area look , 'd -- there's interest . takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowe well , capex standpoint , want continue , close driven customer signal . continue put effort basically shorten thing , shorten supplying team example , sort time speak , term delivering additional capacity humanly possible . goal really make sure 're essentially serving customer need actually stay ahead enough , far ahead agility continuously work . okay . great . maybe round , mean think message 's change sort company investing azure sort signal 's change demand . think seems like 's change tightly manage lead time , yes . yeah . 's ongoing improvement actually make , manage closely possible . least role 'm certainly feeling constrained serve customer need . okay . great . question around sap . sap talked making big commitment microsoft , 's sort . maybe -- 'll kind broaden question little bit . first , seeing term moving sap workload azure maybe broadening tier 1 workload general ? starting see term moving azure ? 're certainly deep partnership sap embrace project announced recently , 're certainly leading azure preferred cloud help customer basically set journey on-prem sap sap hana azure cloud . 's sort tremendous opportunity u one see lot existing growth well future growth opportunity . relates tier 1 workload , sap one example we're increasingly getting tier 1 workload drive significant consumption 's also highly correlated increase number large deal . big enterprise deal 's large , oftentimes catalyzed tier 1 workload strategic alignment customer . go hand hand . takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numotoand maybe related one , sap one example , 've seen microsoft partner lot software vendor . adobe one . servicenow presenting next . 're one . relationship coming ? company approaching microsoft say -- looking way potentially reinvent infrastructure operating ? microsoft going advocating company work closely microsoft ? maybe 's mix ? 'd curious -- seems bunch . yeah . 's certainly mixture . one thing 's important note , conference like -- press people also oftentimes , sort narrow comparison people want aws versus azure google , gcp versus azure , many case , customer need think journey cloud , need lot infrastructure . fact microsoft get conversation broadly m65 dynamic 65 azure collection capability , deliver comprehensively , put u different dialog customer . also provides lot opportunity isvs participate dialog , azure utilization azure delivery service also integration thing like oﬃce 65 user experience deliver day day work 200 million plus monthly active user oﬃce 65. collection essentially enables u conversation isv partner say , opportunity align u , cloud would use deliver service . -- comprehensive dialog would integrate team , would integrate oﬃce 65 , would integrate directory way effectively furthers value customer . 's -- program like programmatic approach support co-sell isv partner 's also another part facility , 's easier -- isvs get also lined joint sale motion microsoft . 's good segue 've got another question . somebody asking team . ca n't believe n't think . yes , mean obviously , team area satya pretty focused talk quite bit . give u quick update team , momentum seeing , maybe partnership ? bunch see . yeah . recently announced updated dau number think 20 million continue see loss momentum . also announced set new capability ignite internet something continue invest significantly r & go market . jennifer swanson lowe takeshi numoto jennifer swanson lowe okay . actually , -- gone lot industry event last six month , salesforce talk team integration . workday , 's lot excitement around team integration . particular push ? -- like mean talked sort broadly 's sort push versus pull partnership , feel like one particular visible . fair observation lot company even n't partner microsoft way seem really finding lot -- customer-led ? sort part microsoft 's broader push evangelize team part platform ? well , think team , great place people come together collaborate business process infused way people work together . natural isvs want integrate team one think text world economical , sort economical separation structured business process adhoc work world collaboration communication team basically give u harnessed two come together . give u lot opportunity invite isvs participate . okay . great . okay . great , well , think 's basically time , wrap . thank , everyone . thank .
