've done sustainability accessibility security , really want evolve responsible ai something people must comply something actually really strive take pride . love . thank . , could talk -- 've kind alluded even opening , important microsoft's success . mitigate risk , mean employee customer , create new opportunity ? whatever want hit within basket question ask , melanie , maybe start u . well , first , 's -- basket issue . really see three way . getting house order , 's 're customer globally , impact ? earlier month , released annual report may year . annual sustainability report , really show progress three-year journey talked way , 2030 commitment : carbon-negative , water positive , zero waste protect ecosystem . reported carbon -- 'll get detail . carbon business grew -- business grew 18 % , emission actually declined 0.5 % . water , able contract 15 -- 15 million cubic meter water replenishment project . 's really going volumetric lifetime project . waste , zero waste target . actually diverted around 12,000 metric ton solid waste landfill incineration across direct operational footprint . ecosystem . actually protected 12,000 acre land . meeting company 's carbon-negative commitment intricately interdependent transitioning world clean energy infrastructure end day . path similar progress appear slow foundation really set ready take place . like training marathon runner think u , take focus , planning , perseverance reach finish line . sustainability-connected community microsoft , 9,000 strong microsoft . member employee provide vital component 're collaboratively driving progress environmental change , within company externally . - brett iversen - natasha crampton - brett iversenon second basket , customer sustainability journey , tech company , role play thousand corporate customer , put trust microsoft technology . many customer already made climate pledge , microsoft working help move pledge progress , much like . company manage measure . microsoft committed helping customer measure environmental impact timely accurate manner . june last year , 2022 , launched microsoft cloud sustainability . comprehensive environmental sustainability management platform includes microsoft sustainability manager . microsoft azure customer also benefited significant upgrade past year emission impact dashboard , help customer understand emission impact result use microsoft cloud . also released preview version something call microsoft planetary computer . enables customer measure , monitor manage ecosystem may affected operation make important decision related climate risk . yes , lot happening . three girl home . -- peak -- perk hear 're sustainability 's talked amongst peer group well . would add ? responsible ai point view , 've always operated microsoft core belief designing developing ai responsibly , 're leading , developing responsible product . 're developing fundamentally better product . 've known trust really essential adoption new product . 's particularly true 're talking frontier tech like ai . 's 've working hard operationalize effort across company build culture responsible ai mentioning . look , employee trained responsible ai practice learning integrate practice work . 've building tool providing resource help journey . look , customer exploring immense potential ai , 're turning microsoft ai product , insight deploy use responsibly . really want share much . committed making sure customer knowledge necessary use ai responsibly , 's part 've published material . playbook responsible ai standard . publish externally make sure 's available resource . 've also shared template impact assessment , one early practice adopt responsible ai work . 've shared sample transparency note well . busy , 'm sure . trust piece mentioned , lot friend sale side , 're going kind cloud portion business product solution sell . -- 's biggest - natasha cramptonthing . like would think 's price thing like , 're competing great company , trust piece biggest portion decision 're hearing consistently . 'm touched . maybe another one . 've involved responsible ai work key point development 've . help u understand 's evolved time ? move principle really , point , kind core operation ? sure . think 's fair say decade ago , field responsible ai we've pioneering microsoft , barely existed . nearly seven year , 've worked advance responsible ai company . think sort building artificial intelligence product service grounded strong ethical principle . let give two example , concretely , 've progressed practice last seven year . beginning , six principle mentioned earlier , principle continue serve north star , principle alone enough . one thing 've done 've taken principle really double-clicked provide concrete , actionable guidance engineering team . 've basically answered question build ai system fairly ? mean accountable ? mean transparent ? playbook engineering team use , mentioned , make available publicly really spell concrete actionable step need taken live commitment . second , 've working tooling . one way making sure 's consistent practice responsible ai microsoft build tool keep engineer day-to-day workﬂows . whether 's tooling fairness interpretability , making sure 're really understanding seeing error , clustering particular way ? 've built tooling team able understand better . n't build team internally , actually bake azure ml , development platform , customer take advantage . look , today almost 350 employee focused responsible ai part role . 've got people integrated product team , come huge range discipline . next year intend grow number people working space even . look , found time organizational structure matter ability meet ambitious goal 've set . one thing done time , well building practice , make change structure , make sure need met . last year made two key change responsible ai ecosystem . first , made critical new investment team responsible azure open ai service . service cutting-edge model open ai available within . second , infused user research design team specialist expertise previously centered one particular team . - brett iversen - melanie nakagawa - brett iversen - melanie nakagawa - brett iversen - melanie nakagawaso , way think , responsible ai today journey continue . go forward , know need learn continue evolve along way , especially government starting define concrete policy regulation govern space . go , we're committed sharing learning making sure learning outside company well . yeah . governance point important sustainability , share many important issue . governance sustainability , 've , guess , privilege opportunity commitment announced satya amy hood brad smith 2020 , really demonstrating executive sponsorship commitment . governance perspective , internally , microsoft also charge carbon fee internally business group help u work carbon removal carbon reduction really help business group see opportunity mitigation plan reduction plan . , could underscore point enough importance internal governance allows u , frankly , move forward key issue . yes , resonates . yes , thank . 'll stay . know 're newer microsoft . maybe little bit brought think helping company reach ambitious sustainability commitment . see work evolving time . yes , , still relative . 're recording . letting know . 's relatively new , first , incredible privilege pleasure join company frankly , one forefront leading ambitious commitment around sustainability matching action annual report year really chock full specific project action initiative 're investing . got . background 've policymaker , diplomat , investor private equity fund , working , 'll say , tech company around world . part brought really bringing nexus technology , policy finance together sustainability perspective . leverage experience 've role sustainability microsoft ? part journey get led . - brett iversen - natasha cramptonalso , term kind go , past month really learning microsoft 's journey get 2030 goal making investment . every day , sit -- wake policy team washington , d.c. help inform u 's happening u europe around world policy action helping drive sustainability agenda . 're really benefiting fact 2015 , world government got together said , committed greater 2- degree celsius warming future world . 's really important . -- since 2015 , government putting place policy , initiative , action . company stepping . 's helping drive business u participate sustainability , also helping drive commitment actually meeting goal need planet . 's quite journey far , 'm excited . yes , good . well , 're happy . 've already talked bit microsoft operationalizes responsible ai commitment get little deeper governance management issue , get lot question , like , 's board involvement , team work microsoft leadership even broader org achieve goal ? natasha , help ? sure . 's really cliche say responsible ai meaningful , really start top . microsoft , chairman , ceo , satya nadella , supported creation responsible ai council oversee effort across company . council chaired vice chair president , brad smith , report ; also kevin scott , 's chief technology oﬃcer . kevin charge setting technology vision company , well overseeing microsoft research . think , 's joint leadership , 's really core effort . sends clear message microsoft going leader technology ai , microsoft going leader responsible ai . responsible ai council convenes regularly brings together representative policy engineering research group dedicated responsible ai . includes oﬃce responsible ai lead aether committee , also bring together senior business partner . partner , responsible implementation program team . part , find council meeting challenging refreshing . 're challenging working hard set problem , progress always linear . yet , know 've got confront diﬃcult question make sure driving accountability . meeting refreshing collective energy wisdom among member responsible ai council , often come away fresh idea advance state art . - melanie nakagawa - brett iversen - melanie nakagawa - brett iversen - melanie nakagawaand specific question , brett , board , environmental , social , public policy committee board provides oversight responsible ai program . regular engagement committee , really make sure 're bringing full rigor microsoft 's enterprise risk management program responsible ai work . actually , similarly , espp committee board also provides oversight sustainability work well . love . investor love hearing . thank . melanie , 's much discussion challenging topic scope 3 emission address . audience maybe familiar , 's greenhouse gas emission n't company 's source 's purchased electricity , rather across entire value chain , 're going upstream downstream customer using product . , think microsoft challenge help others address ? know n't direct control . 'm sure 's challenging topic . well , great . knowledge scope 3 fantastic . yeah , 's right . studied , studied . n't know . ( multiple speaker ) microsoft implementation stage sustainability journey really highlighted key part . scope 3 fixated ? something need know ? scope 3 microsoft around 96 % overall emission . scope 1 2 , around 4 % . scope 3 ultimately decarbonization challenge opportunity . necessitates co-evolution best practice business technology policy among thousand global stakeholder . made carbon negative commitment 2020 , n't challenge support sustainability business , also invitation world participate journey , translating action action impact . major roadblock way call hard-to-abate emission sector . like material . think concrete . prime example growing source scope 3 emission . one example addition concrete semiconductor , chip . global manufacturing semiconductor could probably account , estimate , 3 % overall greenhouse gas emission 2040. one big challenge manufactured country south korea , japan , taiwan , clean energy abundant service type manufacturing facility . decarbonizing semiconductor hard-to-abate - brett iversen - natasha cramptonsectors concrete material really depends transitioning world cleaner energy source , cleaner grid , cleaner infrastructure . future , country build operate cleanest grid , really believe going competitive advantage . economy really serving customer like u really want see purchasing tied aligned commitment . country microsoft others ambitious climate commitment , country 're going want invest procure . , 're also -- another way 're addressing challenge semiconductor material , microsoft 's billion- dollar climate innovation fund . fund investing technology company stage renewable electricity low carbon material . also invest fund called southeast asia clean energy facility . help build renewable energy project throughout region . another company 's really exciting highlight called prometheus material . produce microalgae-based concrete building sequester carbon manufacturing process . technology estimated reduce carbon intensity 90 % compared traditional unit . another similar company called carbon cure . produce low-carbon concrete injecting carbon dioxide concrete mixing , mineralizes strengthens product reduces overall emission . type investment , could see appearing physical infrastructure type infrastructure . mean compare traditional , 're actually choosing climate-friendly , lower-carbon product , potentially better product end day . type innovation 've investing thinking . 's fascinating . like 's -- cutting-edge example . 's interesting hear -- especially somebody spends time finance side house . thank . natasha , similarly space , 's obviously huge interest . get -- every question since calendar year started ir team included ai topic . given recent advance generative ai 've -- incorporating across product service , responsible ai issue unique generative ai ? company working address ? well , first , let say 'm happy 've come generative ai moment benefit seven year responsible ai work point , allowed u mature governance system , tool , practice get ready moment . much practice 've building time directly relevant generative ai work well . generative ai system specifically , use state-of-the-art method make sure identifying , measuring , mitigating risk . said , build long experience 've operating - brett iversen - natasha crampton - brett iversenthese large-scale enterprise consumer service . course , deep partnership openai well , 's really critical . yes . perhaps 's easiest illustrate unique consideration using new bing implementation example sort thing . mentioned , first step process identify risk new system . new bing , process called red teaming . red teaming allows bring together multi-disciplinary team really push edge system understand challenge . thing red teaming 's bit like identifying iceberg ahead . 's important understand , iceberg , n't really understand size shape 're dealing . engaged red teaming core component system , especially new model came openai , moved systematic approach measurement could start measure size shape iceberg , really different type risk surface new system . move mitigation phase . purpose phase really think layered approach adopt mitigating rest system ? many way , really use defense depth type approach , similar might think security context . make sure bake safety right model core system , wrap safety around different layer top well . core issue addressed part identify , measure , mitigate , process included making sure response would get new bing would grounded bing 's search result . sometimes people refer error generative ai system make hallucination . u , think situation , grounded response bing search result . huge help u bing infrastructure really leverage . 've taken number step . 've also made sure using past fairness-related work , made sure bing producing response might reinforcing stereotype otherwise , unfair . couple example leveraged past work , 've layered new mitigation technique top . feel confident 'll continue build system harness learning . think incremental release strategy , 've carefully controlled release new technology extremely beneficial , -- core part approach going forward . love different responsible ai sharing 've given u . 's cross- discipline element across -- 've heard , 's something 're side . 's embedded function , 's - melanie nakagawaintegrated cohesive conversation , think critical . 's come different topic . given , 'm still picturing u injecting concrete , like need learn stuff . given together , , appreciate , -- tell see ai sustainability interacting future ? get question , think concept together , potential harm rapid ai transformation , environmental commitment , 're ﬂipping , promise ai ? maybe 's accelerant global sustainability . would two help think ? maybe melanie , start u one . thanks , great . believe ai essential part building net zero future . ai already playing role improving sustainability management well measurement accountability . think 's really kind awesome potential opportunity set using ai . pick theme earlier , concrete cement . seeing use ai really accelerate rapidly discovery alternative material high carbon material cement . think , ai reduce design validation process new material order magnitude lead faster innovation material low-carbon concrete used building material thing data center reducing overall environmental footprint carbon footprint data center . ai provides opportunity go trial-and-error process really rapid iteration . 've also used ai partner create satellite imagery produce first kind atlas , living atlas , , map world measure utility-scale solar wind installation planet , allowing user evaluate clean energy transition progress different part world different country track time . tool called global renewables watch , 's partnership nature conservancy , nonprofit , planet . really provides unique spatial data land use trend help achieve dual aim environmental protection increasing renewable energy capacity around world . prospect ai advance sustainability tremendous , second thing must also think side ledger . one side , amazing potential ai accelerate clean energy transition sustainability goal . side , also recognize ai model use energy scaled compute . committed bringing additional energy onto grid around world , also working ensure energy coming carbon-free resource electricity . microsoft today already one largest purchaser , corporate purchaser renewable power , 're helping advance innovative commitment carbon-free energy source , like contract announced fusion energy company called helion back may . 're also investing research measure energy use carbon impact ai working way help make large ai system eﬃcient thing green software initiative , reducing energy consumption eﬃcient compute network traﬃc . - brett iversen - natasha crampton - brett iversen - melanie nakagawa perfect . natasha , add interesting fusion two concept ? well , think melanie capture key point , well . mean , think essential use ai address biggest challenge time , course , includes sustainability well . 'm also really grateful melanie 's leading charge making sure proactively addressing energy need compute demand new ai model . work better define question also undertake research also critically important . need deeply understand problem space make sure working towards finding answer durable going forward . one dimension 'd perhaps , add , may , released five-point blueprint ai governance . part blueprint recognizing technology move forward , 's important make sure proper control ai make sure realizing benefit . one specific point 've recommended thought ai system controlling critical infrastructure , safety break . think system , government would need define class , system might controlling electricity grid water supply . similar safety protocol 've put place important core technology , need put brake ai system well . might think safety break 've put elevator school bus high-speed train . conceptually , need ai safety break critical infrastructure well . make sense . 've covered lot ground short period time . thank . close , share little bit think future area . thought road , would say , group ? melanie , start u ? sure . well , future . 're optimistic .
