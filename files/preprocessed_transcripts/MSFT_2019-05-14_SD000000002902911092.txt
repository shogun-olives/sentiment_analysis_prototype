okay . good afternoon , everyone . thank . much joining u conference . mark murphy , software analyst jpmorgan . great pleasure u today , kirk koenigsbauer , microsoft . kirk , thank much u . thank . excited . question answer 're going talking one exciting , fastest-growing product microsoft , called microsoft 365. kirk , n't start background ? sure . name kirk koenigsbauer . 've microsoft since , gosh , 1991. spent little bit time amazon.com four year middle . run microsoft 365 business , inclusive oﬃce 365 , enterprise mobility suite , security suite well window 10 enterprise bunch stuff . think people familiar oﬃce . 're familiar window . they're probably little le familiar whole suite product , - kirk koenigsbauer q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbaueroverseeing . give u little bit overview microsoft 365 fit overall microsoft portfolio ? sure . microsoft 365 product launched two year ago . mentioned , product includes many product may heard . essentially , cloud productivity version . think microsoft 365 sort world 's productivity cloud . , includes value would find oﬃce 365. example , oﬃce apps , sharepoint , new product 've launched called microsoft team , exchange online forth . includes enterprise mobility security suite , number different workload within around management security compliance . course , window 10 core part offering well . sell part -- essentially call modern workplace sort go- to-market , really centered around productivity collaboration . help u frame growth opportunity may looking microsoft 365 ? think 've noted oﬃce 365 commercial revenue line , , large one , growing 30 % recently , pretty incredible given scale . window going well . em going well . want think broader opportunity microsoft 365 ? yes . . 's good question . essentially , way would start frame repivoting whole approach term selling productivity collaboration value customer microsoft 365. workload . way organize sale force go market . 's way organize partner incentive , channel incentive . 's way 're increasingly organizing r & engineering make investment , sort siloed way individual product regard . literally thinking whole system across microsoft 365 deliver integrated value . term think growth , product -- mentioned 30 % growth oﬃce 365 component , think 're 800 million active user window 10. crossed 100 million seat sold em . sort substats underneath really quite impressive . -- 180 million people monthly active commercial space oﬃce 365. 's ton momentum , , , working business many year , really great see . think growth prospect , many way , 's lot like think growth -- used talk growth oﬃce 365. essentially play p x q business . look installed base socket . constantly want look grow socket pool . look increasingly drive arpu socket . socket side , growth perspective , certainly , 're well positioned enterprise corporate space . still see room expand seat q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauerbusinesses primarily think entering market like regulated industry historically challenge selling . sort cloud unit economics microsoft 365 forth , 're able reach pocket user n't able sell past . smb , important socket growth market u . see lot white space , wide open space u drive socket , cloud socket overall . last area socket side would say big growth area u think first-line worker , category worker historically , , underserved technology . might manufacturing . might retail sale professional . might hospitality . might certain segment health care , even financial service , 's -- 're tethered desktop machine . n't dedicated laptop . maybe 're shared device . opportunity reach customer well . arpu side . 've talked , opportunity move customer stack term value . whether 's moving on-prem cloud sort first step , 's arpu driver u given ltv derive customer , selling increasing tier service within oﬃce 365 within window getting microsoft 365. see quite bit growth dimension new offering . 've talked lot , kirk , building modern experience . 've talked lot security past . 've talked lot compliance past . think apparent u 's lot going componentry stack . see microsoft 's core differentiation today ? yes . putting aside workload referenced . certainly jump back , think 's thing customer talk u term differentiation . one integration value sense , sure , customer want go one single vendor . opportunity workload common platform management perspective , interoperability perspective , broader tco perspective , stuff work better together . increasingly important differentiator u . way , 's microsoft 365 level . think security fragmented business , see csos sec ops really valuing notion integration , key one . another value prop resonating u , particularly enterprise side , position 've taken around data privacy trust . increasingly , sort thing happening world today , 's message 's resonating really quite well . 've benefited investment work around gdpr regulation see sort happening world . customer trust , whether 's public sector customer course , large organization , trust hyperscale cloud infrastructure work we're . 's big deal . q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbaueranother big differentiator seeing increasingly around data ai . -- 'll pick security one example . think signal 's world , security signal , whether 's coming e-mail system , whether 's coming identity system , whether coming variety different end point , able look signal reason ai capability investment security professional microsoft , differentiator . number reason , let alone work product like team referenced experience side , work 're security , work 're compliance , thing hear customer . want come back team moment . , wanted mention -- team attended build conference last week , incredible amazing event . satya spent quite bit time talking microsoft graph . think something really captured attention . explain u microsoft graph . going leveraged across microsoft 365 ? great . yes . maybe 'll start . . basically , microsoft graph think api database sits cloud service . 's secure . 's tenant-based meeting . data available customer . 's secure . 's data . get want . essentially , think collection activity people inside organization , whether 's collection email meeting task people go meeting . essentially graph activity . top sort raw information , also derive insight top . example , n't spending much time used spend , 's information derive . one organization within company better job collaboration another , insight derive graph . pretty powerful capability 's available customer , sense use graph first-party experience . good simple example would microsoft search . microsoft search great example app us -- built , us graph back end , search people , content , apps infrastructure , whatever might need , really provided via graph . 's also really interesting ecosystem 's building around graph , whether 's isvs build solution want sell business . solution made better accessing graph information . one example , think , satya used build surveymonkey , company want bunch survey , better target population people integrating tech microsoft graph precise . matter , even building simple line business application , integrating experience like microsoft 365 , use graph data make experience better people . way think graph . q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauer q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauer something 's leverageable corporate customer well third-party app provider , third-party developer ? 's correct . want really crystal clear 's company 's data . say , customer 's data . customer say yes , isv app plug access graph , use data . model . something 's available isvs something use . okay . want come back team . mentioned moment ago . appears making great progress , something 've heard gotten done check interview ecosystem , partner , resellers , si firm , telling u team go , see month later seat count doubling , tripling , quadrupling . satya said something 's fastest-growing app ever recall seeing . said last week build . see team , first , differentiating ? secondly , see team competing company like slack zoom ? sure . starting differentiation piece . maybe 'll also talk little bit , case , everyone familiar . team product launched , guess hit 2-year anniversary product went general availability march . 's product brings together number different workload help people organization communicate collaborate . think hub teamwork essentially . team really size , participant many different team . core part value proposition offering provides number different workﬂows integrated single experience . , example , 's got collaboration capability . 's conversation-oriented perspective . 've got chat . use bot integrate content . 's got meeting capability . host meeting like . ad hoc one-to-one meeting . thing like record meeting . audio conference meeting . 's lot meeting capability that's built product . capability communicate well , using chat forth . phone system technology . wanted call customer call wife , call cellphone number , pstn service integrated , 's dial pad forth . 's bunch work 're third party create teams-oriented hardware device , whether 're meeting , conference call , whatever , . also , 've integrated oﬃce application team . say oﬃce apps , n't mean word , excel powerpoint , , course , q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauer q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauerintegrated experience . also thing like onedrive storage sharepoint . literally take portal page , internet page . include , integrate right within team . 's super , super easy sort thing . power bi dashboard , analytics , wired team . sort 4-in-1 combination pretty powerful differentiator u customer tell u , yes , might legacy meeting solution might using slack solution . idea able come offer single tool end user 's integrated , different workload coherent across , really quite differentiator u . another differentiator 've really seen , , product couple year old . last , would say , 6 12 month , 've super enthusiastic customer responding scaffolding team provides integrate line business process workﬂows experience . referenced , example , first-line worker earlier . 's one use case . we're seeing company , going back graph talked moment ago , using graph data , integrating line business application . sometimes , business application , say , built azure . front- end inside team . experience also front-ended thing like power apps well . really great experience customer could notion horizontal workload , ability able meeting . simultaneously line business application business process integrated right experience . 's super , super sticky . 's much cleaner environment everything integrated one space . customer really resonating . sound like core differentiation , comprehensiveness , integration point . oﬃce woven . graph woven . presume cortana woven . yes , would say one piece n't mention 's important enterprise-grade capability around , whether 's fact operate data center worldwide , fact 've added dlp type capability , thing like ethical wall , sort security compliance around team infrastructure one , company love 's got great sort new experience end user love . also , 's something controlled managed way work business . going one hook pulling enterprise premium skus like e5 sku ? maybe could talk u customer conversation shaping around e5 even e3 ? q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauer q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauersure . well first part question , see team something help u drive sort arpu growth time , sense , mentioned earlier conversation , people start -- organization start using team , see usage rate increase dramatically across board , team . team pull microsoft 365 value . 's good thing couple different dimension . one , course , people using product , satisfied people typically . retention rate -- renewal rate higher forth . really great thing help u up-sell approach look sell higher tier service , would transition , guess , conversation around e5 . e5 , folk n't know much , essentially -- well , 've chased fact . sell microsoft 365 oﬃce 365 em component , even window , different tier service , e1 , e3 , e5 . microsoft 365 , 2 tier . e5 set premium set value offer customer . essentially 4 core workload . 's workload around security . 's workload around compliance . 's set workload around communication . 's set workload around analytics . value proposition around interesting different customer different time depending life cycle . would say , right , term driving growth e5 , security compliance top conversation customer want . security 's top-of-mind every customer go talk . want hear team want hear security . 's got lot pull u enterprise . referenced e3 . still lot room go moving customer , whether 's on-prem cloud , e3 tier , oﬃce 365 e3 microsoft 365 e3 . 's another arpu driver u essentially . still see leg . , going back little bit first part question , whether 's socket play arpu play , feel like good growth opportunity . would put team security kind 1 2 position , maybe interchange . critically important term driving gravitation upward toward e3 e5 ? sure . absolutely , yes . okay . 's interesting team would context already early point . yes . might -- may intuitive initially . , think something driving incredibly rapid usage inside account , q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauer q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbaueritself lay foundation upon go drive up-sell higher tier value . okay . switching gear little bit , interesting announcement past week 2. partnership vmware microsoft . clearly , something significant happening . specific reference microsoft 365 oﬃce 365. want make sure we're kind thinking 's going mean specifically microsoft 365 portfolio product oversee . bet . -- first , guess , would say . referenced build earlier , one key message wanted lay build . 've really , since satya 's leadership , think , particular , doubling notion interoperability notion openness , want super well industry . also want create platform company integrate . think scott mentioned build , half vms azure , example , running linux day . shape company really changed perspective . relationship 've announced vmware , 're excited . 's sort 2 component . one around azure , essentially helping customer move on-prem environment , 're using vmware tech , hybrid way azure , fantastic . microsoft 365 point question , 's sort 2 related thing happening . one workspace one product , product manage oﬃce application mobile device , device like , android , io forth . also integrate azure active directory thing like conditional access , conditional access really foundational sort security capability . word , 've never boston 'm logging device , sort detect , oh , 's different place kirk , let 's actually throw multifactor auth something along line . 's kind scenario vmware able participate microsoft 365. okay . , going back survey work , seeing recent month 's lot feedback em , growth adoption em , strong momentum em . maybe talk mobility security fitting part broader microsoft 365 conversation ? sure . sure . 's -- em , enterprise mobility security suite core component microsoft 365. think -- one 3 leg stool essentially . folk n't aware , em essentially 4 core workload q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauerpart suite . workload around identity . identity core today , particularly security perspective , although also important way identity used organization . sort perimeter- based security sort thing past identity sort 0 trust identity azure active directory , service , , core em value proposition . 's also value proposition around management . 's management plane em provides . us technology called , intune , managing wide range device io android . 's also part em referenced around security . addition identity , 's bunch security value 's part em , whether 's protecting azure active directory , people within directory , threat protection capability , cloud apps security capability . example , organization understand saas usage 's happening inside perimeter inside boundary put policy forth . compliance side , em also , important element protect customer ' information something called azure information protection part solution . 's number different workload . growth -- business model 's obviously high-attached oﬃce 365 course , microsoft 365 . increasingly , see em sold stand-alone well , good see identity security value proposition . referenced earlier crossed 100 million licensed user em . really -- 's doubling year-over- year , doubling year-over-year . really , really strong growth rate em , important battle u . okay . impressive , 100 million . let 's continue path bit . 're getting domain security . topic 've heard satya others microsoft spending lot time . think notion marketplace whole world security spend typical company maybe area ineﬃcient spend . perhaps , many point solution , many company charging little much money security arena . microsoft -- kind zoom back take 30,000-foot view , microsoft thinking security ? maybe going fit , , microsoft 365 conversation ? sure . well taking step back , area , think , lot opportunity reason referenced , 'll get . customer lens , hear # 1 risk blocker achieving notion digitally transforming business . want move cloud . want move saas apps . want variety different device employee use whatever task 're working . end day , really quite concerned risk security front . 's hot topic thing 's getting way digital transformation . q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauerand piece referenced space hard category sense simply enough security professional world keep sort cyber threat . -- referenced , highly , highly fragmented . hundred , thousand apps . 're -- many , narrow term . many also on-premises-based . 're native cloud-based solution . space see really ripe u tackle . 're making major investment space across board . referenced em important . think security , really think across board term , , identity . think end point , end point security meaning across different device , whether 's defender , let's say , window platform , 're taking , way , across platform mac others course next year . think information protection another important part story . compliance always come conversation well . 's we're talking . think security , super broadly , 's 're talking csos sec ops . 're literally starting conversation chief risk oﬃcers , chief compliance oﬃcers , chief legal oﬃcers , cfo forth , super , super invested information protection content within organization . 're investing big time space . , 's tough say 's 1 2. typically , whenever 's end-user conversation around microsoft 365 , 's team . come infrastructure , customer care management , care interop , care lot thing , really , really care security . 's , first foremost , want talk u . would mention brieﬂy . announced recently , 's lot work 're sort end-user compute side microsoft 365. azure's also investing deeply space well . , example , azure sentinel product announced rsa conference month back , 's great example space largely on-prem , fragmented , really ripe disruption , really ripe using ai across vast amount signal . 's going real differentiator . would position sentinel anyone audience 's totally familiar ? yes . 's -- almost think -- simply , think , , cloud- based , think tool allows cso , sec ops people generally able look across infrastructure , signal , able identify threat across , , literally different security system . 's something -- think almost aggregation layer across -- across q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauer q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauer q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauerentire estate . 's -- 's critical every company . 're quite humble 's early . also really enthusiastic opportunity . microsoft going tackle security across level stack . core data center endpoint . 's going something extremely overarching . sound like pretty well thought . yes . hope . okay . let 's move . want touch window 10. know important topic people . work , think trying ass would peak actual activity typical enterprise 's going motion upgrading moving environment window 10. feeling , peak kind migration activity coming sometime soon . 's coming next kind month , handful month . view opportunity kind drive additional customer adopt window 10 n't already done ? yes . , 're right term context . 're within year window 7 reaching end support . within really 12 18 month -- way , oﬃce 2010 reaching end support . 's creating real nice tailwind u really important need customer get current , get modern desktop , window oﬃce . window side , specifically question , 'd say 're probably roughly halfway sort upgrade cycle 's . 's quite bit room work left go . really important customer . 's really important u perspective latest greatest value window . also conversation , 's lower tco , secure operating environment . customer 're window 10 term adding additional security value top . notion getting current end-user benefit . also really important term infrastructure . way customer approaching customer , course , upgrade existing machine . many buy new window 10 machine refresh cycle . next 12 month really quite bit activity space . kirk , , much would thinking growth versus pc market point cycle ? q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauer q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauer q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbaueryes . n't share much . would say folk expect growth rate line market essentially . performance last couple quarter sort consistent . 5.5 minute left . let 's check audience question , would raise hand . 're going get microphone back room . lunchtime ? okay . pretty packed room , fact , needed room twice big . lot hand going quite yet . well come back , come back moment . let try ask final one broad topic , innovation , future investment . 've heard satya talking 's using term `` tech intensity . '' feel like might coined one . think . notion company going -- increasingly , 're going adopt software technology kind maintain competitive edge , . spoken 's going -- kind 's driving microsoft today future . go back last earnings call , amy talking investing pretty aggressively upcoming fiscal year , fiscal '20 , try capture opportunity . want think microsoft 365 , right . play notion innovation future investment ? yes . . 's good one . would go back chatted little bit . think top 2 thing 're hearing customer 're interested , really get around create sort modern experience end user . team forefront . shifting r & resource team . increasing number seller team folk customer success around . 're working channel make sure incentive aligned properly recruiting partner build kind isv solution forth . 's huge investment around team across board many different dimension . really big 12 18 month team , think . security , talked little bit sort similar profile . 're investing quite bit security space r & sale channel partner q - mark ronald murphy q - unidentified participant - kirk koenigsbauerinvesting quite bit . investment 're making well . top 2. would highlight thing like talking . important year modernizing desktop . window 7 , end support , oﬃce 2010 , end support , within sort next fiscal year , next 12 18 month growth company . , 's important customer . 's also important u get customer modern . allows u better job up- selling higher tier service forth . 's lot 're ai space underneath investment talked . every single one product benefiting ai . opportunity use ai make product better , make relevant , help people automation , everything automation decision-making insight , identifying threat security side , helping lawyer ediscovery process , reducing cost , using ai sort really front center 're . referenced couple example thing 're quite bullish . idea delivering within team using power apps power platform , industry- specific line business solution . really think 's something 's going quite important happens next 12 18 month . company lay infrastructure microsoft 365 wiring business process , workﬂows , 's going something 's going deliver business value 've ever able really term sort laying vanilla infrastructure collaboration . think 's going big deal . 's ton stuff . 'm going check one last time -- okay . lot question . got one far back . much functional overlap see team e-mail ? said another way , extent people use team , much le use e-mail ? yes . 's question come bunch . far , different product term problem 're trying go solve . e-mail , outlook , combination outlook exchange online forth , 's going around long time . people use sort ubiquitous way reach sort -- whether 's anyone inside organization anyone outside organization . growth rate , term usage e-mail , continue go . continue increase year- over-year , rate 're seeing growth something like team . expect e-mail around long , long time . team , use case little bit different . team really designed around work , individual work broad set collection team part . work environment , -- 'm probably member , q - mark ronald murphy - kirk koenigsbauerdo n't know , 40 different team participate . 's conversation sort ongoing time . sort use team sort tick stay current share content information . team , many way , hub . 's much hub , say , teamwork , whereas outlook much sort pure communications-oriented tool , communication calendaring forth . 're , get notification e-mail team activity . show calendar information inside team meeting scheduling . there's quite bit integration . talked little bit earlier bot example . sort write one- spot approach , write bot show team , show inside outlook . 's going increasing integration . think essentially 2 different use case . well said . apology . multiple question . run time . kirk , want thank kindly sharing vision insight spending time u . great . awesome . thank . thank .
