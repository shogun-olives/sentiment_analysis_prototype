's couple way inform unlike game console , 's largely playing game , pc could used esports 's two type people . many way play sport . play sport enjoy . play sport want win . think another way think asp people athlete aspirational athlete really love win . need better gear 's one reason see esports , high-end gpus q - toshiya hari q - aaron rakers - jensen huangare like 20 adti 's . want 20 adti 's want run never missing heartbeat 120-150 frame per second . many gamers click 300 click minute . click , want make sure get shot next person . kind frame rate , 're going miss click . buying best gear another reason . rest production . calue increasing time . max-q increase asp 's . max-q increase asp , using higher end gpus running much lower voltage . much higher end gpus running much lower voltage deliver great performance . max-q 's great innovation really running -- using silicon way running lower energy eï¬ƒcient point . max-q increase asp well . production increased -- production value increase asp , max-q increase asp , competitive gear increase asp kind factor n't play game console game console sensibility provides , think , long- term ï¬‚oor . n't know number help , 's kind space u 's dynamic 's causing asp grow time . yes . thanks . aaron rakers well fargo . great presentation . think one interesting thing heard idea revenue sharing geforce alliance . i'm curious kind first question , think proliferation partnership ecosystem ? thinking term service provider . help u understand attribute revenue sharing model ? think financial perspective ? one real quick follow-up question . updated color kind visibility datacenter side would helpful ? thank . sure . every country different telco . many country eastern europe western europe asia , southeast asia , latin america , india . first time 've able create game platform scale region . one billion gamers . gamers 've able reach western china , many emerging country would love access pc gaming . pc gaming particularly great , 's free play , 's social , 's easy access , 's open . want pc anyways . need pc anyways . , lot characteristic pc gaming make vibrant unique . using geforce alliance , reach . buy server u operate network top . buy server u , operate network top . take term relative -- go subscription model , go right 's beta , go subscription model . q - aaron rakers - jensen huangof dollar , call $ 10 month subscription fee , maybe 'll keep half , 'll keep le half . reason bought server , 're operating , 're running network , make sense ? capital investment . top , 're bringing network , 're bringing service , 're developing software , we're operating , 're enhancing qos onboarding game , we're marketing , nvidia gaming platform . , get benefit well . one thing 's really great order capture , gosh , 's terrible way describing . order win new customer , economic benefit many know quite significant like time . , pretty fantastic way differentiate service somebody else's service . many -- way see 'll probably enter least one relationship per country . larger one , maybe two three . quite scalable approach . 's one reason 've built whole stack . could , nobody else planet . 've built whole system , architectured whole server , develop software , everything one everything one shop . course , 've operating service couple year 're getting quite good . second question . data center visibility ? data center visibility . data center business grid mind . 's high performance computing . 's high performance computing . 's csp training , csp inference , csp cloud enterprise high-performance computing . enterprise high-performance computing , example , data science , cloud computing , thing quoted today . deep learning know well . inference , jay talked , last year kicked , 're fantastic . supercomputing , know well . 's one way think . go-to market industry , overlay across . monitor intersection everyone grid , use go-to market different . jay told , way going market , basically several way . one course direct sale cloud service provider . second , basically high performance convergence -- hyper-converged , high-performance computing solution , call reference architecture , dgx pod reference architecture . also go market enterprise partner . , different way going market track pipeline one . , get better visibility get lesser visibility . example , last year little bit le visibility hyperscale data center , -- retrospect realize , bought much capital earlier year really , really slow . n't know time , time found , well quarter . , area le visibility , try much pipeline monitor pipeline weekly basis , feel pretty good year . q - john pitzer - jensen huang yes . john pitzer credit suisse . thank presentation . couple question , one kind near-term , one longer-term . near-term front spent lot time yesterday today , really focusing investment software platform ecosystem . one competitor place bunch emphasis process technology mine [ ph ] node . would love hear kind talk sits kind quiver ip maybe talk path 7-nanometer , 's near-term question . guess longer- term , last week , clearly demonstrated think interconnect going important going forward data center architecture . wondering could make sort comment around memory , clearly 's one competitor looking memory persistent memory perhaps way really lower tco . view competitive threat could memory side thing help ? yes . n't hear u talk process technology , packaging technology , memory technology . reason , even though world-class using oftentimes earliest . example , 3d packaging , world 's first sxm , largest chip world make . hpm , used anybody else . reason n't talk much , good buying stuff anybody else . n't find particularly differentiating -- 7- nanometer . 's available anybody want buy . want sell . , point differentiation . point differentiation architecture eï¬ƒciency . example , fact 2080 ti 2080 turing much energy eï¬ƒcient compared somebody 's 7-nanometer gpu . shocking everybody , , 's whole point . able use something cost effective , could -- cost effective , cost eï¬ƒcient get architectural innovation , 's hire engineer . tsmc hire engineer building 7-nanometer , job get eï¬ƒciency silicon purchase . goal able deliver best energy eï¬ƒciency , best performance , best functionality given point time . turing crushingly good . got measure , good . 's one reason great start . term data center , see u really differentiate course buy best . 're one world 's largest consumer hpm-2 . fact , world 's largest consumer hpm-2 . 're world 's largest consumer 3d packaging tsmc cowos . shipped 3d package anybody , n't talk , customer n't care , care functionality get , eï¬ƒciency get , performance get , tco ultimately get , 's care , 's focus . order overcome slowing moore 's law , order overcome dramatic way , n't mean improve 10 % . want overcome x-factors , 're . overcome cpu 10 % , might well wait next cpu , accelerated computing requires software optimization , would 's x factor . mean 10x q - mark lipacis - jensen huang q - mark lipacis - jensen huangfactor , 's fair amount work , 's 600 plus application framework , deep learning neural network model accelerate . engineer worked really , really hard , , 's , ecosystem , everybody working super hard . n't pervasiveness cuda , nobody would lift finger . , different mapreduce hadoop , essentially announced called rapid accelerated hadoop , think way . okay . hadoop come memory called apache [ ph ] memory , top called rapid . rapid , way think rapid essentially mapreduce except accelerated gpus . well , n't build unless great deal computer science expertise , 's nvidia , 's differentiation , 's 're addressing percentage share market someone else created , 's company always talking new market we're creating new market tends -- ten hundred billion dollar large industry . ca n't unless go reshape , re-factor , come new algorithm , ca n't build faster ship alone . hi . mark lipacis jefferies . thanks lot presentation . hi , mark . found accelerated computing platform framework vision particularly compelling . seems like customer , biggest customer also use lexicon platform , also lot resource wondering could help u maybe share u framework thinking frame -- platform customer developing , -- nvidia platform , -- -- customer platform sitting top nvidia platform sitting next nvidia platform , let 's say 5 10 year line ? thank . yes . excellent . reason mark look -- look across cuda- x , two square horizontal platform case customer , partner - - partner ecosystem partner would tend jigsaw puzzle interweave . part platform stick , part platform stick , accelerate part platform . okay . , let give example . case cloud machine learning platform like google machine learning cloud aws sagemaker microsoft azure ml . okay . case , xgboost library stick way top . rapid , essentially modern version accelerated version mapreduce go way top . cudf basically like panda one user spark data center , cudf basically like spark , accelerated pipeline [ ph ] ecosystem . cuml basically psychic learn . okay . platform go way top case . many case like tensorflow , tensor core architecture , tensor core amp basically cudnn , cuda cudnn tensor amp , stick deeply integrated tensorflow , see tensor flow , depends . way come , try create platform ecosystem prefers another platform supplier approach , would integrate . one n't exist one never exist , example , n't write rapid , mapreduce gpu accelerated data center would never exists . nobody -- nobody know . nobody -- nobody engineer nobody go , 's much work . mapreduce sitting top yarn sitting top hadoop complicated stuff . gpu accelerate beyond comprehension , nobody going go , that's go , took four year go . -- first part platform like data science , integrate depending like . okay . , google stuff sticking , notice rapid virtual machine google cloud platform machine learning . sits next tensorflow , case sagemaker , rapid integrate sagemaker ( inaudible ) . case azure , vast majority 's take . okay .
