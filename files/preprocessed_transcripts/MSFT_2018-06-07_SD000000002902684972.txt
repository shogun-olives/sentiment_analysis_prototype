'm sure 'll talk little bit morning . includes oﬃce , window , enterprise , enterprise mobility security suite whole bunch product associated . 've microsoft , gosh , since 1992. worked bunch job , running engineering team , running project management team . q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer celebrate 25th year ? well actually , amazon.com three year . 'm really around 23. 'm close , getting close , getting close . yes , please , interrupted walking responsibility . oh , , 's good . yes , 're responsible essentially portfolio product around oﬃce , window , , em , think introducing new product called microsoft 365 across commercial segment education segment well . 's tremendously interesting time last couple year microsoft transformation 're making cloud . certainly , oﬃce microsoft 365 offering last year big part fueling growth . 's fantastic couple year . stock 's $ 100 , pretty darn good . n't seen $ 100 long time . seemed unthinkable 4 five year back . yes . 's amazing . yes . remember smart client , obviously unnamed , telling -- smart client , stock never see $ 30 . company never earn $ 3 , never . 's like time frame something ... satya 's done amazing job . 'd think , gosh , one person really impact company big 's 100,000 employee one person tremendous impact . one client -- , unnamed , come best acronym stock symbol . msft currently miraculous satya software company . 've heard . q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan thank . know . thank . know guy made small acquisition couple day back . ? hub . 's got something front . github , 's right . oh , yes , 's right , yes . tell u -- sorry put spot . i'm sure 've know . 've able digest , speak people microsoft . thought github acquisition ? yes . obviously , 's fresh . 's exciting . think 's reported . satya super passionate personally , great . think -- least think many way 's fueling growth microsoft forth , cloud certainly big part . reinvigoration developer ecosystem big part , . developer something satya 's incredibly passionate company large part developer fueling innovation many part industry . 's really center everything , whether 's financial service , health care , retail , manufacturing , name . people building technology help move business forward reimagine incredible way . microsoft , want make sure everything foster developer ecosystem . opportunity github really incredible one , thought , bring together company . also recognize big opportunity see help developer better collaborate share technology bring forward , also huge responsibility space continue maintain open platform nature git developer , tech , framework going remain core part value proposition github , fostering nourishing community developer that's incredibly important u . running many way like 've run linkedin independent organization . key piece well . 're really enthusiastic . obviously , 's early day . 're , bullish . - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbaueryes . shankar talking note looking deal said , ultimately , developer base good on-ramp microsoft cloud . develop application put ( inaudible ) 're ready put production large-scale deployment , path microsoft cloud . possible avenue could synergize longer term microsoft ? 's definitely opportunity . think first foremost , want really -- similarly 've , think , approached linkedin . want linkedin grow . result see linkedin , example , sort switch topic anything . growth saw last quarter , 's something like 37 % . previous acquisition , think quarter like 17 % . like want everything drive business leveraging strength microsoft similarly github . asset microsoft github use , 's fantastic . think , first foremost , success github . time , course , 's opportunity help microsoft side , 's fantastic , . nourishing developer ecosystem , open platform community priority sure . got . got . let 's shift business , oﬃce business . yes . great . 's massive business , nearly $ 25 billion annual revenue , larger many independent saas company . congratulation . really big saas business . big iaa business . separately , stand-alone merit base , largest 5 , 7 business saas . important -- level set u strategically important , talk azure iaa amazon halo effect . talk u important really oﬃce 365 company , strategic relevance ? yes . well think maybe 's couple different way look . think hear ... continued growth business ? 's feeling oﬃce going ( topped ) 's like gdp growth , whatnot . q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbaueryes . know . 've heard 15 year . 's one thing think people look company highest level , 2 substantive growth driver . course , 's lot important business . 2 biggies really around azure microsoft 365 , many way evolution oﬃce 365. talking developer core mission value proposition company , think productivity collaboration also core sort spirit soul microsoft really . 've business long time . 's evolved many , many way . oﬃce kind center value proposition . perspective , could n't strategic . could n't important . think 's interesting time market right . seeing business environment sort new culture work 's emerging last couple year . 's driven whole number shift term demographic shift , like millennial population coming market . something like , 2020 , 50 % population millennials . 've got big shift market term physically work get done . 're 50 % ? yes , exactly , gen x , 'm lost generation . 's actually changing really way people work together . notion teamwork collaboration super different sort growing early '90s workplace . notion sort individual hero n't important success team collaboration . think meta point , first time , go talk cio information technology leader business , interested serving need end user , people business getting engaged , giving tool want , modern tool sort experience personal life workplace . 10 year ago , security compliance , locking thing structured work . 's amazing pressure next generation worker putting bdms business leader great tooling workplace . 's creating huge opportunity u oﬃce feel like 've got sort incredible balance able solve service need end user 're trying create thing , 're trying team collaborate together , 're analyzing data , working project , whatever might . also platform secure , compliant , that's got control folk need . interesting part , think cloud transition sort looping back started question framed question , many workload workload moved cloud first . 's large part oﬃce 365 , think , successful . 've able leverage broad installed base sort legacy on-prem world bring base cloud workload 's , hot business right . 're suggesting , oﬃce done incredibly well q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauerlast couple year oﬃce 365 forefront , next big step microsoft 365 evolution , . look old oﬃce versus new oﬃce 365 , 's oﬃce run cloud . 's lot . help u understand , somebody that's deployed oﬃce 365 , value 're getting could get oﬃce 2013 oﬃce 2010 oﬃce 2007. think 're oﬃce 2010. 're still 365. hope get one day . life going look like upgrade oﬃce 365 ? yes , sure . well first , broadest level , oﬃce 365 much diverse value proposition many people , think , think . 's word , excel powerpoint . 's secure mail backend exchange . 's sort document sharing collaboration service sharepoint onedrive . real-time communication skype business , new product essentially supersede , talk called microsoft team . also variety new emerging workload part , whether 's product called microsoft stream power bi , 're also part oﬃce 365 analytics video-based content . 's really broad set service help people creative , help people analytics , help people teamwork collaboration . 's essentially broad value proposition . addition though , build security compliance product . 's , big driver , way , growth moving cloud forth . certainly talk . one key part value proposition relative sort old legacy world , one element cloud delivered . mean different thing . mean customer date latest capability value . 's important world's moving quickly technology changing end user want up-to-date stuff opposed , saying , guy 2010 whatever . mean , literally , software built 2007 , started working oﬃce 2010. ... like test thing . sometimes 's buggy . yes , exactly . like 're literally delivering software weekly basis mobile device . corporate customer , give option whether want consume software monthly basis longer chunk . essentially , notion always date , important , , end- user value . also listening cisco conversation moment ago , ability able deliver secure platform particularly world there's vast array different threat . secure environment cloud day . mean , number security professional . q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauerthousands people working security scale able deploy real-time customer , 's powerful value proposition . yes . intrigued said functionality included collaboration , chat team . said microsoft team ? microsoft team , yes . yes . 've hearing lot context github acquisition , implication atlassian atlassian , et cetera . 've discussion investor make whole -- space onedrive part , whole content management , collaboration , folk like slack , unified communication folk like ringcentral , et cetera . tremendous initiative get videoconferencing , audio conferencing market . 's big chunk sku . see disparate functionality playing we've followed collaboration market 20 year 's really failed materialize really pretty significant way . change maybe oﬃce 365 overarching umbrella , chance thing come together ? yes . . space 's around . 's many life . think one 's quite interesting 's really fueling around notion messaging-based collaboration obviously quite hot . talk little bit . essentially value proposition company , look , need right tool right task . many cio 'll go talk say , gosh , want one thing . ca n't one thing solve collaboration need ? reality , would nice . 's really realistic . nature project work different . could working project together . maybe 's document 're working could team 50 100 people working project . project last couple day . last 6 week . last year . project different center gravity . task-based . document output . innovation creating new product . 's broad space people like work differently turn , . approach deliver oﬃce 365 notion universal toolkit . mean , variety different tool right type collaboration project culture team term want adopt particular project . example , referenced sharepoint onedrive . people want work document oﬃce , sharepoint , onedrive , oﬃce application , making work incredibly well together thing like real- time collaboration sort seamless workﬂow make easy share document together , able track change see 's happening . 's important collaboration experience . q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauerthere 's important part mentioned . unified communication really key . see tremendous amount growth skype business online service today , whether 's using instant messaging workload , meeting collaboration , voice . talk total addressable market tam space . voice service , large one , particularly think add-on service like pstn service forth . 've investing deeply area long time . really coming together quite nicely . notion sort chat-based experience , built product called microsoft team . think team essentially hub teamwork , many way value proposition 're talking bringing together one unified approach . team absolutely messaging capability . threaded , persistent chat , like lot different service . 've done , sort magic product fact 're integrating oﬃce service directly . pop open team environment , see , 'll see word , excel powerpoint integrated beautifully , like microsoft onenote integrated . power bi integrated . well adding unified communication service . thing like ... videoconferencing . videoconferencing part . make phone call team . set structured meeting schedule meeting well ad hoc meeting . canvas scaffolding team one reason ... integrates calendar . integrates calendar . team calendar associated ... 's got ai built-in . 's lot opportunity ai across oﬃce 365. communication one . talk value proposition intelligent communication . example , one scenario talked enterprise connect conference couple month ago , guess , setting three four-way phone call . human , 's actually tricky , like -- button press phone ? literally , team , speak team ui , whether 's phone shell say , hey , let 's set call q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauerbetween kash , kirk , victoria jonathan . ai , agent behind . simple example something save people whole bunch time . idea box integrated experience , 's ton work done . smartphone , n't need desk phone , right ? . yes , team pc-based experience also mobile experience well . yes . 've telling lot people presentation 've set voicemail desk phone eight year back instruction came manual . said , way . still n't know whole world communication moved cell phone , running capability . 's definitely big transition . go business , see fewer fewer desk phone . come bank america , 'll see desk phone . still got get oﬃce 2010 , sound like . know one salient aspect oﬃce business revenue growth outstripping unit growth . presumably , 's lot upsell 's going . help u understand whole e3 cycle ? e3 e5 upgrade cycle , thing looking ? enterprise deployed e5 , business benefit ? life look like , particularly maybe microsoft already deployed e5 internally . oh , yes , sure . well gosh , 's lot question . let sort unpack little bit . broadest level , 's obviously big business , referenced . complex . 's bunch different workload . business model relatively simple . 's basically p x q business model . want get many socket possibly . u ... q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer 'm glad said thought missing something . p x q , totally resonates . super simple , econ 101. want drive many subscriber possibly . see tremendous amount opportunity continue overall installed base expansion , broadly speaking , oﬃce set workload . still see growth sort mid ; high single digit , fantastic business many socket already . 'm talking commercial point . see opportunity place like smb , tremendously underpenetrated term opportunity look like ahead . see opportunity category worker called first-line worker . oﬃce traditionally gone knowledge worker , information worker market . people room , essentially , people work pc particular focus higher need . 's whole class worker feel like cloud economics allow u target . example , whether 's hospitality worker , retail professional , whether 's ﬂight attendant , health care professional necessarily sit front pc day . absolutely need scheduling , collaboration , task management forth . see big socket opportunity u well . 'd also say emerging market u interesting opportunity , particularly think mobile-first , mobile-only market . 've traditionally targeted pc-centric part business . think emerging market tremendous potential well . second part , course , getting socket . driving much arpu possibly , balancing share need . obviously , n't want go far arpu impact share . spend lot time thinking model . question arpu side , continue see arpu growth , fantastic see . big part transition on- prem cloud . view part p equation sense higher ltv customer . 're able deliver service . course , 's margin top service 're delivering well . that's fantastic . still -- 's customer sort purchased online service 're moving higher tier . roughly 40 % base still e3 . 's still tremendous opportunity move sort e1 stand-alone workload , say , sharepoint exchange move e3 . 's big part arpu mix . fact , 's frankly biggest part right mix 's tremendous opportunity . referenced , 's thing called e5 . e5 highest tier service folk n't sort steeped . e5 value proposition around , well , voice service talked around communication , analytics service , thing like power bi sort ... q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer team , microsoft team ? microsoft team e3-oriented service today service , actually e1 e3 , depending look like . service though calling e5 tier sure . security compliance big driver e5 value proposition , whether 's sort threat intelligence , atp-type service . also compliance gdpr really big push . would say world sort slow realizing n't something 's going affect european company . particularly last 6 nine month , 've seen big market like u.s. wake gdpr . see -- e5 -- 're three year journey e5 . 's big factor arpu shift well . see tremendous amount opportunity going forward . resistance -- customer upgrade e5 ? usually hear , oh , 's pricey n't need functionality 'm ready maybe 's resistance , 's issue educating customer base . well could say 's resistance . think 've somewhat -- bit old dog 's journey p x q business . introduce next tier service , whether 's , geez , oﬃce client going standard enterprise oﬃce 365 introducing e3 , e4 , e5 shift microsoft 365 shift e3 e5 component well . 's always inﬂection point really begin see hockey stick part growth . think 're still sort moving curve e5 side sure . value proposition around , would say -- depends customer serve many different customer . security compliance sure top workload really driving e5 value proposition right . fact , 's diﬃcult go visit customer talk security , talk compliance . 's lot fragmentation market . build security compliance capability right product 's bit unique value proposition . talked little bit ai earlier . 's key piece well . 's something customer looking deploy right away right sale cycle faster , say , sale cycle something like voice , ripping pbx putting new cloud-based software , longest sale cycle . 's wrong ? yes . well come like company building new building , 's really natural time contract come . contract 6- , 7- q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbaueryear contract . come , 's great time go . sale dynamic little bit different across workload . 've studied math , offer relatively sizable discount e5 , buying component stand- alone . 's absolutely economic value proposition even customer interested deploying right particular workload even couple workload . 's tipping point 'll say like , okay , shoot . maybe 'm ready voice . want analytics capability , want compliance capability security stuff , let 's go e5 . , 're seeing lot . got . got . yammer several year back , made way team team complete rewrite exists yammer ? yes , know . yammer 's great acquisition u . 's part universal toolkit referenced term right tool right task . think something like , well , scenario walked . talked document collaboration . talked team team people working together . yammer another interesting part value proposition one would say gotten new life breathed last couple year ceo leader big part company want able get touch employee organization . want able broad-based communication discussion essentially organization . think yammer sort outer loop communication , , would used community-oriented purpose . example , microsoft , satya read community , yammer community . look . think look every day . employee post question . responds directly he'll delegate one directs . maybe 's legal question , 'll brad ... bot . yes , exactly . 's bot right . could bot , guess . idea foster employee connection . yammer 's done quite well business really interested vehicle able talk broadly organization dialogue , really , really different 's small group u working together project . 've quite pleased . done bunch work yammer last couple year . work showing end-user value . infrastructure work term integrating core capability around , oh , gosh , group technology make integrate easily -- whether 's outlook team , whether 's thing like compliance capability , security capability , , single sign-on rest oﬃce 365 service . 's bunch integration work 've done , . lot great energy , lot great value mobile device , course , , key . core -- 're pleased . q - kasthuri gopalan rangan q - gowrishankar subramanian - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer 's different looking product value proposition , lot innovation introduced product . juncture , anybody question , raise hand . 'll get mic , checking see . know shankar team definitely question 2. question , right ? okay . shout . 'll paraphrase question . ask . n't shy . putting spot . . really ? ( inaudible ) maybe question enterprise mobility suite . talked installed base , experimental user ( inaudible ) . talk 's trending growth rate -- projected growth rate see next year , kind put take around ? yes . room , n't know everybody heard question around enterprise mobility security . big part microsoft 365. 's big part business . 's seen tremendous growth . installed base -- ( inaudible ) referenced , publicly quoted 65 million , great . grew 55 % year- over-year . growth incredibly strong em . em bunch different workload . 's almost suite product similar , say , oﬃce 365. tell u exactly em ? yes . figured could . 's got identity component . folk 've thought active directory azure active directory , 's key part . identity , core workload like oﬃce microsoft 365. 're applicable many business need set identity system . security moved identity . 's longer sort perimeter-based even matter hardware- oriented . 's literally notion identity core essential security . workload huge driver growth , great . also security compliance component part em , . , example , azure -- launched azure active directory advanced threat protection set capability one example . went ( ga ) march time frame . compliance capability well , azure information protection . word , providing service help thing like data loss , data leakage protection document whatever might . important component managing device . talk modern management em service called intune , manage device variety ﬂavors , including io android . capability around thing like conditional access forth . q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauerreally suite 's around identity , 's around device management , that's around security compliance . business model one product sold separately . also , natural attach motion oﬃce 365. 's one reason decided launched microsoft 365 bake oﬃce plus window enterprise . also em suite . 're seeing u lot integration work make really sort seamless experience customer . 's big growth driver u sure . calling 365 , denied vacation ? trying funny . 28th one ? exactly . like 's europe , got microsoft 340. 's right . u.s. , microsoft 375 , overworked . 'm curious get thought -- reorg done end march . rationale ? thing look post reorg , objective ? yes , sure . yes . -- pretty substantive reorg internally . know people really care outside world . big deal internally sense moved ... 's big deal internally , big deal . right . got . see . essentially , think sort advancing cloud platform aspiration broadly , whether 's platform iaa side 's saas side , mentioned earlier , azure microsoft 365 sort hero product company right . obviously , 's many product . key driver u . created essentially 2 center gravity core engineering company . one led rajesh jha . run 's called experience device group , 'm big part . 's sort bringing product product ethos experience sort end-user value q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan q - unidentified participant - kirk koenigsbauerproposition 've talking little bit morning together . 's oﬃce component , 's window shell window experience component . component em talked . also device experience surface line product , whether 's big hub device surface -- new surface laptop surface book , whatever might . really bringing whole notion experience together device one organization . 's one big part . part , course , cloud ai part company . think bringing together asset platform side pushing forward . , github acquisition sort important perspective well . sort center gravity think developer infrastructure . guy like san francisco . yes . like san francisco . last 2 acquisition , valuable one san francisco . 's interesting say . yes . creates nice center gravity . 2 big engineering orgs absolutely work closely together . example , we're talking em . part em built cloud ai group , part built e & group . lot kind experience . 's important . 's like 're going back old day division anything along line . 's still functionally aligned company . 2 center gravity really help u accelerate ambition cloud side . think 's genesis really . think mentioned -- oh , yes , 's question . ( nadi ) , get mic center table . going back moment discussion oﬃce p x q. think 3-year time horizon , guess , 2 question . one , think mid ; high single growth unit sustainable time horizon ? secondly , force rank growth think 'll get unit versus pricing , one sort bigger driver , period ? q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbaueryes . interesting . first question , anticipate 'll able continue grow installed base sort range 've . think 's huge opportunity u . talked driver think growth come . obviously , 's still room large commercial space public sector space . lot come new category opportunity around first-line worker , smb think emerging market forth . arpu side , , continue , feel , lot opportunity on-prem cloud shift shift e1 stand-alone workload e3 probably big driver u . continue quite bullish e5 potential year , particular beginning see real strength compliance security . talked little bit team . talked little bit skype business . voice communication space , also see quite bit opportunity going forward . term dividing percentage come , 're sharing level detail . think opportunity p q continue drive business . per-user business , , course , drive socket , get big number . growth rate exactly 3 five year ? course , that's going look little bit different . , arpu growth opportunity , think , quite substantive . question ? one final question/observation . think mentioned word window whole talk . 's happening window ? tell u window . mean , hear lot oﬃce 365 , azure . anything say , anything say ? yes , sure . 've talking little bit microsoft 365. think 's -- really , fact , 's interesting take step back . hero 're really driving right think productivity collaboration experience microsoft 365. microsoft 365 oﬃce . 've asked bunch oﬃce question , great , love , take day . window core part moving people window enterprise skus well em . window remains important ever term delivering rich endpoint experience pc device increasingly different type device like surface hub forth . 're quite bit work oﬃce window engineering team make sure much , guess , would call coherent , well integrated , symmetrical set experience people using window shell using oﬃce-oriented experience device . rajesh leadership team , 's window leader oﬃce leader sitting together working problem forth . reorganization , think , actually important window business oﬃce business brings team together way satya 's really q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauer q - kasthuri gopalan rangan - kirk koenigsbauerpushing year . kind really hardens sense , hey , window business , oﬃce business , 's microsoft 365. 's sort push 's really driving . 's marketing bundle ginned . 've reorganized sale force . 've reorganized engineering team . leading microsoft 365 hero experience . n't talk much . 's growing triple digit term seat . direction we're moving . window absolutely fundamental value proposition microsoft 365. first product company started . yes . good . note , want thank sticking u three day . going third day . 're going wrapping hour . special call folk made trip australia , singapore , japan . one gentleman took direct ﬂight zurich , 12-hour nonstop . another person made 16-hour trip singapore . really appreciate support conference . heard feedback last year 's two day , 's really worth ﬂy way . added company , extended format , made three day . hopefully , next time , 4-day conference point future . 's many company 're creating tech , creating software . look pipeline . kirk , yesterday 4 company , private company devops/whatever want call , infrastructure . 're $ 100-plus million revenue , growing 100 % . 2 , three year , 're going public . guy going spending , hopefully , 3 , four day u . lot company software . really appreciate support . , i'm going depressed tomorrow high getting conference . kirk , thank much taking time present , really appreciate time . yes . thank . thanks lot . yes . thanks .
