thanks everybody joining u exciting session 's coming . fortunate join manuvir da vice president enterprise computing nvidia . nvidia course largest -- single largest market cap company extremely exciting thing course business , think exciting thing , one argue happening 're data center manuvir deep . , 'm going turn manuvir , got short slide deck want talk , manuvir , ï¬‚oor . thank much harsh giving nvidia opportunity talk audience . 's real privilege . thought outset , share big picture view nvidia 're headed data center artificial intelligence q & . i'll start statement sharing slide always . first picture something 've shared announced new software product nvidia called nvidia ai enterprise . thought would start level set . news we've shared prior , , right , think state union artificial intelligence enterprise enterprise customer large , state today 've lot success early adopter , know , there's thousand company across world great success improving business , improving experience customer artificial intelligence . broad base enterprise customer yet adopt ai , right . fundamental reason ? fundamental reason , two different set people within every enterprise company . one hand , data scientist , people understand ai , understand tool , jupyter notebook , kind thing , need development new ai capability . move fast 're pretty agile state-of-the-art cutting edge , new thing every night . hand , 've got administrator accountable responsible making sure actual application running enterprise data center safe , secure , stable business company depends , right . experience customer depends . two persona -- sort two world pretty much apart one world data scientist want use tool framework 're comfortable , whereas administrator used different model deploy application , disconnect know pick data scientist would use , data scientist n't know operate ( inaudible ) . created nvidia ai enterprise address gap took nvidia 's ai software training inference data science 've made work top vmware vsphere , sort de facto platform data science . look enterprise datacenter today , find virtualized server rather vmware vsphere . 's picture show , right , achieves two thing time . one hand data scientist , see tool framework comfortable experienced work , 's green provided nvidia . hand , administrator , 's vmware vsphere environment used tooling hardware , provision hardware access people , new workload ai . really way bringing two world together . 've announced earlier year conjunction vmware , nvidia ai enterprise , really nvidia 's way becoming mainstream enterprise customer making ai mainstream workload enterprise customer . , actually beginning . really want share today something nvidia thinking working many year , right . realized mainstream artificial intelligence enterprise data center full stop problem . course , need right hardware , layer shown green , also need piece software , sort operating system ai , essential tool run different ai virtuals . finally , think , 's different use case there's vision ai detecting interesting thing going video feed cyber security finding attack happening data center would love piece software customized framework use case easy adopt . 've drawn abstract picture representative . think brick wall rather really want solve artificial intelligence problem need fully construct brick wall different basket get complete solution . nvidia , exactly 've done . picture replaced every one abstract concept nvidia product bottom hardware product . middle top , software product nvidia produced last year especially last year really complete brick wall . vision slide , execution slide . thing 'm showing slide today already exist , already usable customer . fact matter today nvidia much software company hardware company . thousand software engineer within nvidia work -- thing every day . built entire stack set framework different use case , essential software allows run mainstream server , said , conjunction folk like vmware et cetera , hardware . announced recently , partnership equinix put technology , hardware software equinix data center around world , customer get going , 's easy start journey , nvidia pre-deployed thing proceed journey course procure deploy thing data center colocation facility . come back , harsh , final point wanted make nvidia pretty fast moving company , right . general philosophy . exercise 'm going show picture , picture last year , show thing execution mode actually produce , would slide actually look like ? would look like , whereas today look like , right . wanted end making point nvidia r & first , innovation first company . business result today based work 've done last year team working every day today , software stack producing putting unlock opportunity year ahead . 's 're really focused company . harsh , 's bit opening context adding statement , . artificial intelligence enterprise data center full stack problem , 's end-to-end problem , requires broad ecosystem . nvidia 's focused , put hardware , 've put software , 've created ecosystem . 2.5 million developer use different part stack develop application solution , 's contribution make ai feasible enterprise customer . , go-to-market motion conjunction established partner , oems produce server , folk like vmware produce software stack data center 're really looking forward journey marketizing ai enterprise customer next year . , stop sharing slide deck hand back , harsh . q - harsh kumar - manuvir dasquestions answer manuvir , simply incredible see number product guy introduced last 12 month able fill gap trying go . 'll bring interesting topic , lot change , covid , generally data center always morphing , always changing , talk 's changing , large change happening industry sort wake think say , kind direction nvidia maybe need think going ? yeah , 's great question , harsh . 's amazing much landscape data center changed last decade . know hear buzzword day like cloud , kubernetes , container , thing . 's common thread , right ? common thread quite time , computing data center done scale-up route . take one server , run application application get demanding , make server bigger bigger capable , right . buy server 're super expensive . happened advent public cloud proliferation different model , scale-out rather scale-up . instead one giant server , let many small server cooperate run workload , right . computer science decade referred distributed computing public cloud moved clear . kubernetes container mechanism building application distributed computing original , right . data center really evolved last decade . mean ? mean run application , instead running one server , 're running set server working conjunction run working . think computing , thinking building best server . think networking . data ï¬‚owing across server , think security , malicious thing intercept one server , access server . think store data 's accessible server , right . computing really evolving data center scale . every workload run within complete data center rather single server solve full-stack problem , think 's right server , right networking gear , right networking software go fast , software stack orchestrating workload running workload ? put together , right . nvidia really evolved become full-stack company reason . q - harsh kumar - manuvir dasnow , thing would say , harsh , know , genesis nvidia hardware company , right , gpu . insight nvidia order make full stack go , 're going need three essential component every server . course , need cpu application traditionally run . need gpu way accelerating workload every server . need new form factor call dpu , data processing unit , sits network interface really run , workload , infrastructure data center , okay . every server need cpu , gpu dpu conjunction . vision data center . course gpus , bluefield dpu nvidia , also recently announced working cpu optimized artificial intelligence called grace cpu based arm technology . really see future direction data center , every server cpu , gpu , dpu inside , right . summarize , would say , know said lot , harsh . really think computing going forward data center becomes data center ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) rather full stack problem . believe every server need cpu , gpu , dpu inside essential hardware component need right layer software showed slide bring together within data center . amazing , manuvir , seems like opportunity getting bigger bigger data center compute sort get distributed ï¬‚attens , . guy , 'm sure talk lot customer 'm sure highest end customer actually come problem say kind need solved . seeing term 's actually strategically important customer area customer emphasizing versus de-emphasizing particularly result , example , covid-19 're caught right ? right . think mentioned pandemic , two profound impact , harsh , 've simply seen targeting u two side coin , namely amount impulsive connection gone , right . one-side coin mean company work business across employee et cetera , employee able group together anywhere , right . question company remain productive , even though employee different place working home , right . 's one consideration . second consideration company 's engagement customer base , also changed pandemic , right . 's become much online digital even . change they're interacting customer , , right . let take minute break , right . q - harsh kumarso take first one , employee sitting room together . instead , approach nvidia customer , instead looking loss , actually forcing function new opportunity , actually technology allow company far productive leveraging people world , rather leveraging people room . created platform called nvidia omniverse , make available enterprise customer way think nvidia omniverse , digital real time remote collaboration environment people working project . could engineer designing building together , could designer creating facade display somewhere together , omniverse , people essentially log place , collaborate real-time , one person make change , another person speak , right , creates whole new model collaboration working together , right . put much emphasis omniverse . 's big , big initiative nvidia course , bit bias modern world , well , one core technology need really good graphic 's something nvidia know ( inaudible ) , right . natural , 's also distributing computing problem , 's also scale , 's data center scale problem 're running giant sort thing different people connect workout , right . 's one change harsh within company 's work , 's omniverse , course , technology remote work like vdi nvidia working quite time gpu technology continue , right . see lot adoption example workstation think , employee working home rather , need proper workstation home , 're going work home , right , change ( inaudible ) , right . 's one side . side , company's engagement customer base , much digital online even two year ago , right . see -- look conference right , right , video conferencing technology , visa proliferated , right . see thing like need converse customer , called conversational ai , many customer conversation . n't enough human company conversation , need automation , need ai , need chatbot interact customer website , right , handle request query . , side coin , 've seen lot company interested adopting ai see way greatly enhance communication customer base new era , customer relatively disconnected physically , right . two thing . -- mentioned maybe something 's become important versus something 's become le important customer ? talk - manuvir da q - harsh kumar - manuvir dasabout example would appreciate first something customer focused today maybe ? yeah , know 'd love answer one , harsh , 'm going pas , know , better worse , happen position talk customer , 's mostly thing want -- that's usually focused . yeah . okay , 's fair . let 's talk half first question well , big company , one complex thing done come nvidia suspect probably partner today , increasingly future actually coming saying need x , , z help u 're sort involved earlier . -- correct thinking correctly ? , really happening ? seeing -- enhanced interaction customer daily basis requirement want fulfill ? think 's great observation , harsh , 've . true . put way , right , ai actually ai , hard customer implement . 's truth , right . sort went phase proving technology complex working small number customer really need . yeah , like example , online shopping site need recommend customer buy next . know ai help painful diï¬ƒcult might , 'll jump . people work earlier , right . evolved 've sort broadened reach across enterprise customer , looking point piece technology deploy software put piece hardware , want solution , right . want solve business problem find conversation nature hey , use case . problem ca n't solve , tell recipe . hardware need ? software need ? isv application budget need work ? datasets need acquire order training ? 's complete discussion . believe much , harsh , look inside nvidia , large organization , dedicated organization call solution architect people , seller , sale rep , product engineer , sit middle , every customer conversation begin 's problem 're trying solve , sa , sit almost consultant , right , partner design solution , design solution , maybe use technology , maybe wo n't use technology , 's fine . either way , adopt ai , nvidia , 're super excited partner , right , think good piece technology even folk like harsh like go conversation executive level customer , right , never q - harsh kumar - manuvir da q - harsh kumar - manuvir dasconversation ( inaudible ) , never conversation ( inaudible ) product want sell , right , conversation 's problem 're trying solve , architect think solve , think might want architect infrastructure data center solve problem . align , maybe help part architecture , right , 's going hold . 's amazing way think customer interaction customer situation like feel help issue vendor trying sell product like put , put best . yeah ( inaudible ) harsh , think n't mind , might get trouble saying , bos jensen , ceo nvidia , know , would say one word us meeting folk like nvidia empathy , know , 's sort important word dictionary start , empathy customer , understand situation 're , problem 're trying solve , opportunity trying take advantage make happen . know budget allows nvidia connect completely different level versus rest vendor . let 's move software . mentioned software earlier . nvidia 've noticed last three year bringing increasingly amount software marketplace , specifically relates ai would say core competency nvidia . talk nvidia 's ai software , differentiating factor , adoption curve like dream dream , 's long question , dream dream , opportunity nvidia ? yeah , 'll reverse order punch line . think believe execute well plan , least multi-billion dollar incremental software opportunity top already today revenue enterprise ai primarily based hardware people buy , even gpus networking gear et cetera . think , simple way think look inside enterprise data center , certain wave software , example , vmware sfe et cetera deployed across server 's commercial model software reason software solves important problem customer , run workload ? software almost important hardware software customer ' experience set customer expectation software supported , certain level quality performance . updated regularly , sort thing . 's commercial model software , entering world first time , right . today , new software , 's made available community people make life easier , first q - harsh kumar - manuvir dastime nvidia ai enterprise , really similar kind product sold thereby customer allow , right . 's simple math many server world , many server expect would used ai , 's licensing could software every server would fair customer , know multiply thing 's least multiple billion dollar incremental revenue layer software , right . -- 'd stop . first question , part ( inaudible ) , right . truth matter need right year brought software , fact , nvidia ai enterprise went general availability last month , right . 's beginning roll , 's new version vmware support rolling . 're beginning journey . certainly expect broad adoption . think adoption two front , harsh . one software adopted . thing software really 's making possible take regular mainstream server data center today would normally think using ai , use ai . also -- expands balloon two different way . one way 's new thing called software commercial proposition . second software brings lot server picture used ai expands reach , right . 's going would say , see big opportunity , 're early adoption . steep part curve , . one thing might say piece part , simplest way would describe adopt ai , need two thing . number one , data scientist people , need develop ai 've developed , 've got great model , need deploy ai within application , actually use ai example see what's going ( inaudible ) . okay . essentially introduced two platform . something called nvidia base command , one enterprise user develop ai 've got platform called nvidia fleet command use deploy ai place need deploy , right . 's highest level simplest way thinking platform , 's base command 's fleet command 're excited . said , much early stage . manuvir , one thing , think 's anybody space 's even close level work guy , know historically nvidia pioneer ai hardware side . see focus software side . one even zip code nvidia operates bringing complete package together ? q - harsh kumar - manuvir dasyeah , , course , 'm biased . would say think , right . -- elaborate , right . think picture shown slide , point made really full-stack problem piece part hardware , system , low level software ( inaudible ) top , we're company planet working lead , said , slide vision side , slide reality slide thing . operate different level big believer ecosystem , whether 's cloud service provider server manufacturer whatever , right . model , happy partner anybody anytime . example , must company focus building framework top level , apis use minimally software basis developing effect , might assistant manufacturer like dell hp , incorporate gpus dpus server , right . certainly company every -- fact , foster ecosystem intentionally , believe nvidia company planet , harsh , focused entire stack . 's ( inaudible ) optimize datalake service case . absolutely , question , guy forefront compute ai long time already . brought something manuvir earlier fascinating , omniverse . omniverse fit software strategy , talked term collaboration , obviously 's got longer game plan would think nvidia putting much upfront . opportunity adoption next couple year maybe 'll hit first go . yeah . 'll one backwards punch line first ( inaudible ) basically looked target audience omniverse work 've done , think 20 million designer engineer . omniverse would great platform day-to-day work . simple math subscription-based model 've already put fixed norm standard industry , , definitely multi-billion dollar net incremental market opportunity use omniverse , right . 's one way answer question . way answering , pointed , talked collaboration 's certainly use case remote collaboration . see bigger opportunity , right ? bigger opportunity see harsh one way actually time together , everything nvidia done inception company , whether 's graphic ai robotics self-driving car thing , fact , fundamentally , simulation . okay . 've built technology different domain allow simulate something without actually . 's core technology . like example , think q - harsh kumar - manuvir dasabout platform self driving car . yes , drive car around capture 's happening road make car better , course , , also complete simulation platform use mile mile driving `` without actually driving '' right , learn lot . really believe going forward , matter industry 're , world evolves , simulation become routine basis 're productive dealing omniverse 's know dramatically changed state art term platform stimulation -- real- time simulation , actually model thing see 's happening , right , think massive opportunity go beyond way collaboration . . thank . thank . recent earnings call , think jensen focused lot software one reason . presentation , 're talking lot software . see change happening . question , think 're carrying -- far start generating meaningful amount opportunity revenue software stack really bringing table . yes , think 'll answer . 'll apologize answer relatively generic way instead giving number , right . see , definitely journey beginning , steep part curve , seeing massive interest . know 're heading right direction , certainly right , revenue primarily driven thing working many year , right , thing begin pay go focused . said , know quoted nvidia enterprise well omniverse enterprise multi-billion dollar opportunity , see real opportunity , right . would also assume -- also want paint picture accurately ( inaudible ) . 's fact next level software opportunity nvidia way mobile phone 've discussed , right . 'm talking sort essential software know artificial intelligence , collaboration simulation omniverse . think real ai journey , real ai journey ? 's saying every walk life , matter industry company , certain function human performing , right . -- function one one , figure way automate function ai , much cost effectively could free human focus thing . good example thing use nvidia 's software framework look x-ray detect whether -- whether fracture ( inaudible ) right , 's something today radiologist . take function ( inaudible ) right . space retail , look camera feed across q - harsh kumar - manuvir dasthe store determine shopping 're walking store , right , instead roomer backroom sit look video ( inaudible ) right . one one , take human function replace nvidia software . question asked , potential business value software ? business value software function much cost nvidia term engineer develop software . business value term valuable enterprise customer replace human function augment human function automated software , right , see rich landscape business opportunity software yet unlock , right . 's whole domain opportunity . wanted shift gear little bit manuvir , 're last kind seven , eight minute . wanted hit upon , late since maybe acquisition mellanox , hear nvidia talk lot smart nics dpus guess connectivity core theme , touched upon distributed compute methodology , update u feel , , importance thing like smart nics dpus , maybe 's difference two , roadmap company two particular connectivity product ? yes . let . firstly , starting 's -- somebody get smart nics dpus number people -- number company work smart nics , right . think best way think , smart nic sort step one say 've got network gateway installed , data ï¬‚owing , put little bit computing power maybe arm , arm cpu core , processing data 's ï¬‚owing network . took next level clearly concept dpu . dpu product family called bluefield idea dpu much horsepower processor actually take function data center . 've heard lot last decade software-defined ( inaudible ) . really mean ? mean thing 're dealing data center firewall thing dedicated hardware , 're turning software running server , happened , load went server , mean le le place application actually run . whereas , would needed five server run application , need 10 half server consumed job dpu really , oï¬ „ oad work onto processor , move , free cpu main server run workload way fit dpu , actually accelerates , 's like gpu , take firewall ( inaudible ) move cpu dpu , 's shifting problem , run 100 time faster . need much le silicon dpu job would q - harsh kumar - manuvir da q - harsh kumarhave cpu , right , actually save money data center , right . 're higher dpu dramatically change way data center architected . view every server need ( inaudible ) . two specific thing done harsh think distinguish . first thing we'learnt great lesson gpus , created software sgk interface called cuda simple way developer interact gpu . said matter gpu use , cuda cuda , right . make work going . 've done thing dpus , 've created sdk called doca 's consistent sdk across dpu family , ( inaudible ) ecosystem programmed api , sdk work translate make better better dpus software would become better , proof point , second point want make , roadmap , already working bluefield 3 , third generation , 've already announced architecture pf bluefield 4 , right , 's making processor better , working version processor actually gpu capability inside dpu well , right , ai inside network , right . think enables , right . 's summarize harsh . one hand , rich hardware roadmap much powerful dpus becoming , created interface called doca drive along . ecosystem develop processor get better , software get better along way . manuvir , 's amazing . described well . think maybe 15 , 17 year ago , maybe even 20 year ago first nics coming , trying understand . point take away complex functionality cpu cpu seems like thing happening except function getting complex , 're software richer . basic functionality 're moving stack , great company like actually make data center simpler way like said , 's cost effective , mean , anyways , 's fantastic stuff , lot think , lot unpack . manuvir , always , pleasure . thank much time . thank anybody joined listened presentation . really appreciate time . thank , manuvir . thank , harsh . pleasure . behalf jensen entire team nvidia , really appreciate opportunity today . thank much.take care .
