're undergoing business moment pretty robust growth rate . take look level leadership need able operate environment , take lot energy . take lot effort . 's one . also operational rigor , 'm sure 's something known outside world . really try run world little bit like mission control , like space shuttle control center , n't know , maybe 's spacex blue origin whatever 's called . take data-driven approach actually run business . incredibly detailed dashboard . deeply understand revenue distribution composition across world leading indicator necessary u predict thing going . lot call spread management . run business across many different country , exactly tell 's certain part business 's well country . cut country level . actually cut team level . see whether really successful spread best worst across world . really try learn best increase worst . , consistently really , really data-driven approach help run . maybe give simple example , know , example , customer benefit move bidding system next generation machine learning call auto-bidding smart bidding . deep q - brian thomas nowak - philipp schindler q - brian thomas nowak - philipp schindlerunderstanding percentage customer base , portfolio come smart bidding auto-bidding penetration . know exactly 's best world . know exactly 's worst world . know exactly much value generated advertiser much value time generated u moving worst best actually obviously also increasing best little bit . lot spread management , rigorous way . operational rigor one biggest area focus . understood . 's lot , irreplaceable . yes , $ 100 billion revenue , plus minus annualized basis . guess mention different product , thought automated bidding good example kind want go . 'd curious hear sort process take internally think trying push new advertising unit new monetization opportunity platform ? sort debate lot time wall street addressable market ad dollar . think sort amount dollar available captured alphabet ? couple different thing . first , addressable market side , 's lot misunderstanding people usually refer total line advertising market , le traditional television bunch adjacent area . 's usually described $ 500 billion , $ 0.5 trillion market size . let 's forget 's huge different chunk , line market different estimate high . lot people saying 's least equal size , higher . actually -- actually agree . look . agree bigger ? well 's equal size , would line , bigger , potentially . adjacent market slightly overlapping . look fact still 90 % commerce oï¬ „ ine , 's big opportunity obviously environment . general , n't think sense traditional advertising . think actually business connecting business consumer . long business generates positive roi search advertising obviously -- one main market , providing incredibly positive roi advertiser 's actually working . hope business invest represent actually adequately investing understanding roi generate . reality 's working really well . long roi positive , n't think really limited way look market . market size . look maybe second -- first part defining question , look core business , usually try decompose business , especially search business , different q - brian thomas nowak - philipp schindlercomponents . look , example , core search , # 1 part decomposition would obviously query . maybe 'll park piece second . next big piece within obviously ad coverage . go little deeper run actually internally . ad coverage obviously 100 % . 're trying provide best answer . 're trying provide meaningful answer consumer . reality 's probably interesting development path think metric . next one -- call customer -- click-through rate next big part decomposition . click-through rate side , , , similar question ask , 's upside ? 's improvement area ? telling fixed rate somewhere towards 100 % ? obviously . creative make better ? deploy machine learning make ctrs better ? , interesting area development see world . last big driver core search business obviously whole world cpc , customer click , people willing bid . environment , one biggest driver cpc world conversion rate . , , similar development . take look world conversion rate , 's upside , mean , investing lot comparable business , probably deep understanding conversion rate . n't think anybody would say we're coming close world 100 % conversion rate . 's probably even fraction . think upside done accelerating mobile website , loading speed , making payment easier , making transaction easier , making discoverability easier using better ui , 's probably significant upside , right away , basically , positively inï¬‚uence cpc development . look total addressable market perspective , connecting business consumer . look detailed decomposition search business . think 's lot interesting potential . point search , wanted ask . let 's start mobile search , last year , mentioned ad coverage . 've seen number ad unit increase . case mobile search , last couple year , 's series innovation well least think helped drive better mobile search monetization . sit seat , 2 3 product 're excited continue drive strong mobile search monetization go '19 '20 ? yes . first , keep mind , launching roughly around 100 enhancement core search product probably per quarter . 's , significant number . second part question 'll talk really thing 'm excited . really upside ? , 'll talk , first , potentially little bit later term overall development . drive ad coverage ? upside cpcs ? 's upside click- rate ? help partner , ecosystem , advertiser , agency , partner work better thing . pretty significant investment area described . feel 's lot room improvement . q - brian thomas nowak - philipp schindler desktop side ? desktop -- sometimes focus tech company 'd like think . oldest business ? think desktop search business , 's 20-year-old business . 's $ 40 billion annual revenue , still growing . think high single , maybe even low double digit quarter . 's pretty impressive . able monetization perspective ? transition towards mobile voice , think desktop monetization potential ? 's great question . always keep mind , new platform come along mean platform fundamentally disappears . doubt obviously mobile mobile revolution significantly increased amount interaction mobile device . reality also desktop still robust business . give feel , 's lot use case , mostly high involvement use case want complex travel booking , look new life insurance , insurance type , desktop business actually , robust . expectation level actually -- stay quite . take look future , 're exactly right , next revolution , evolution , whatever want call , mobile one parallel mobile one kicking obviously everything voice search assistant broader context . look effort area , assistant product roughly 1 billion device . moment , 20 % query u.s. android - - android mobile app coming already voice . 's definitely trend emerging also already happening , significant scale . 's happening across multiple different surface . expectation level amount interaction digital device much easier use voice- controlled interface , level interaction increase . probably assume case . thing 've done historically oï¬ „ ine world transition easier user interface across different surface ? , mean whether 's mobile phone , whether 's mobile device , whether 's speaker , whether 's car , whether 's smart device different type . yes , course , mean , 's interesting development . challenging part general , smaller surface area , surface area , higher expectation level consumer high-quality result , whether 's organic advertising result . 's something 're actually historically good . simple example , look desktop , ( 10 billion link ) . look mobile , lot le . look system , give one single answer . consumer expectation level quality answer significantly higher . obvious follow-on question would probably , well , voice , voice world , one single answer , build monetization model ? think 's really important understand context assistant mean voice , voice model . many use case going forward , especially commercial use case , think actually see voice , display much interesting use case . see already smart speaker emerging . think lot area actually q - brian thomas nowak - philipp schindler q - brian thomas nowaktalk sort digital assistant . get visual back simple example , right , 're interested buying new nice jacket ask assistant , `` hi . show nicest , whatever , blue jacket available site category , '' like would want speaker say , `` well blue jacket b c , '' would rather really nice picture displayed ? 're world , think , 're comfortable visual result , really amazing discovery experience room advertising , course , call really interesting commercial experience well . business roughly think evolution desktop mobile assistant , different surface , different output factor , way , different input factor well . voice need input factor assistant . think world use something like google lens , video , picture input factor assistant . 's different input actually different output , depending user actually feel comfortable . jacket example actually may -- might answered next question . n't -- perhaps . 've investing shopping search quite time shopping action , google express , product listing ad . mentioned voice search . next step really capitalize shopping ? need visual interface ? really deliver value advertiser search shopping perspective ? well mean , mobile device , -- desktop mobile device , pretty visual interface , right ? 's already working well . lot really nice shopping product . look product listing ad one , shopping action , example , 've launched , 've seen 7x increase something number merchant participating , including number , big merchant , nike , best buy , sephora , really nice development . obviously ability measure sale lift much different scale . think 're talking somewhere area 10 billion-plus transaction 've measured already environment . talked google lens use input factor . lot really , really interesting product area . reality also look existing pla product , probably biggest product moment , product listing ad environment . look shopping query look -- left right , swipe little carousel , would describe best discovery experience ever developed world mobile shopping ? probably . 're spending lot time energy thinking make bigger , better , richer visual experience , better consumer experience overall . 'm actually pretty excited , put positively , upside ui development user experience . let 's go back voice search point , -- voice , 's lot talk voice search service . threat alphabet ? opportunity alphabet ? - philipp schindler q - brian thomas nowak - philipp schindler q - brian thomas nowakdo think kind voice search sort step need kind make -- chasm cross actually real monetization opportunity ? well think voice search context assistant development talked , well knowing 's tiny little difference , depending define . look evolution platform , desktop mobile assisted interaction computing interface , 's something voice search fit . assumption assistant environment computing interface becomes easier use ubiquitous , see lot . see lot richer . see lot visual output factor . , use case -- 'll go even simplest use case , what's weather forecast next 10 day . really want assistant read 's going rainy monday tuesday wednesday go ? want like sort projection picture something mobile device triggered something television nearby room 're aware 's nearby room privacy-sensitive way , obviously . 's many different way think assistant service rich answer 're exactly world deeply understand , similar monetization model actually run today . got . thing search want talk idea discover feed activity card point making search visual . sort early learning product ? think sort building advertising really helping advertiser buying demand product ? yes , mean , great product . think -- discover feed , like 800 million monthly active moment . 's nice number . 's feed try understand consumer well obviously give really relevant result . whenever understand consumer well . create also interesting commercial experience around . 's definitely something 're thinking something 're excited . would think comparable run traditional search system moment . youtube , video product youtube certain number tv . 're well positioned perspective . still think based ( authorized ) data , youtube still destination # 1 come online ad-based video . strong reach , strong engagement . maybe talk recent ad 've rolled trueview -- around youtube , 've heard trueview reach , trueview action . changed advertiser discussion - philipp schindler q - brian thomas nowak - philipp schindleraround youtube ? talk u real driver youtube 's revenue growth . yes . youtube always really interesting platform brand advertiser . 've really tried develop last year also ability youtube cater performance advertiser . 've invested pretty meaningfully last year . 's actually worked really well . reason look consumer actually using youtube , mean , 's significant amount something , learn something . incredible . mean , let ask , mean , room -- see paying attention , room actually , one point , used youtube either search something want get better research certain product ? yes . everybody audio , think 's probably 90 % -plus , become better financial analyst , whatever . mean , 's lot , become better running google business guide also probably . reality 's lot really , really , relevant information , obviously , get system infrastructure right , challenge around conversion tracking . n't easy path . reality , mean , working . 's working extremely well performance advertiser . think 30 % advertiser new -- one using performance product youtube . 'm actually excited part development . obviously , let 's forget youtube still great brand advertiser . think 18 49-year-olds youtube top 10 primetime show u.s. combined . mean , pretty meaningful number . brand well established performance business . mean , something happened like . mean , universal app campaign , think started 2015 , roughly , tapping performance trueview action , launched , think , march 2018 , remember correctly , year ago , exactly discussion talked . yes , 's exciting environment . new group advertiser . map probably got , sometimes say 's under-monetized asset cover , 's google map . 's almost like utility 're kind waiting put switch . guess there's early map monetization experimentation last couple year via sponsored link , via promoted pin , et cetera . talk u sort early learning map monetization product . put take make internally decide quickly push cadence monetization ? yes . map , 's lot different angle look map . think easiest way differentiating different consumer use case . 's obviously angle use map basically get certain destination , quickly . 's much utility use case . need really cautious n't interfere consumer experience q - brian thomas nowak - philipp schindleron one consumer want get really quickly destination want information quickly . understanding destination , 's obviously interesting monetization model develop around . second big one people asking something around near . something near ? something around ? look latest product 've developed like local campaign , way , based lot machine learning using advertising product described , think 's quite interesting area think like . third one really broader discovery element . want discover something around , directly near . broader sense , could think personalized recommendation . think , , privacy-sensitive , opt-in way , basing place 've already visited historically , make recommendation take completely different world . think fourth area think world call google business , smb world , discovery small business around . tie make really seamless , easy experience ? think think map monetization , 4 different angle , little bit caution obviously first one , disrupting utility aspect . 3 , think , really , really interesting playground going forward . 's sort talk machine learning almost overused buzz phrase . i'm saying , . guess sort simplify someone like , give u example use machine learning internally improve overall user experience , advertiser offering even value bring partner publisher ? give u example go internally use machine learning . user experience , 's many example . mean , everything google photo operates hood spam detection many thing . mean , 's gazillion example use user experience . let focus monetization side -- advertiser partner experience . interesting area probably 've completely revolutionized apps product like universal app campaign . fundamentally built around machine learning . smart shopping campaign today . something 've launched ago , call responsive search ad , 're trying tackle creative problem try basically much better predicting good creatives , rewriting creatives completely rethinking world creative digital environment , way , go back -- remember decomposed beginning core business talked ctrs . think thing come together , development could . different product . also uplevel little bit ask , okay , use machine learning either better finding audience general right message right audience , right creative disposition react certain advertising message obviously audience side . , think creative perspective . big color q - brian thomas nowak - philipp schindler q - brian thomas nowak - philipp schindleradvertising , talked . big third one obviously bidding fact machine learning algorithm significantly better significantly better bidding human , traditional system pretty obvious . think audience creative bidding perspective , also really , really interesting area applied frankly 've applied quite . advertising team , sophisticated using latest machine learning development basically apply different area . see lot interesting thing come . ctr , roi advertiser , lot going . one asset , think , almost n't enough attention sometimes , view , google play store . asset power billion android user . 're taking , depending structure , 15 % 30 % cut transaction . think 's pretty good business . couple big debate go , perspective . first , 1 2 biggest area innovation 's needed app store ? number two , think potential restructure commission rate maybe even lower help publisher get exposure kind get lower take rate ? look , way think developer publisher however want refer partner , 're getting actually pretty significant amount value investment . 're investing heavily world , whether whole world security safety , massive development create really clean safe ecosystem . 's big area . look different developer program 're running , play best console , massive , massive investment side , really value creating developer . 's big area . look whole world payment , payment infrastructure , facilitating payment , making easy , seamless . another big world . look , # 4 , whole world discovery , recommendation engine , promotion app , really appreciated developer ecosystem well . look 4 big area , think 's lot 're getting back . actually feel pretty good , pretty interesting setup . mentioned payment . would argue last year , alphabet's payment strategy evolved somewhat . time go , sort think importance better linking transaction advertising dollar spent , payment probably going get important . maybe talk u learning sort rolled android pay different iteration past couple year . sort 1 2 area really focus payment going forward ? q - brian thomas nowak - philipp schindleryes . 's really interesting , mentioning part linking transaction advertising piece , lot people refer . actually find interesting piece payment perspective sitting -- facilitating transaction piece , accelerating , making easier . , go back said beginning , start decomposing business really work , really want drive conversion rate , one biggest driver moment , mean , room abandoned sort shopping cart process similar purchase process simply diï¬ƒcult use payment credential , right ? think could drive , example , conversion rate approving , simply payment ï¬‚ows , think 's actually interesting upside . 's one . think way thinking payment 's really worthwhile spending time emerging market come payment . moment , 'm seeing exciting development traditional established market . see lot really exciting thing happening emerging market . go even . one successful -- one really interesting payment product actually launched india , 've taken totally different look payment . created conversational ui around payment . call google pay . used call tez time . 's interesting development look number moment , think 're 40 million monthly active product . processing run rate , think , 60 billion transaction processing moment . see u actually developing payment emerging market taking mature market obviously thinking value proposition user actually go significantly beyond traditional payment . 's much , whether 's loyalty site , whether 's lot different area . think really make payment successful , need create new value proposition environment . work closely obviously bank financial institution . yes , 's think . interesting learning emerging market one . upi certainly helped lot india . couple question . going open q & . question philipp , raise hand . mic runner running . 's one . emerging market point , completely agree advertising side , payment side . alphabet 's pretty , would argue , aggressive investor sort make sure 're well positioned emerging market . nonpayment , advertising opportunity see emerging market potentially appreciated wall street community ? 's interesting asked . think slightly differently . like actually think like # 1 focus come emerging market actually making existing core product successful even successful emerging market think upside search perspective , youtube perspective , map perspective , android perspective , actually -- think , 's pretty significant . , course , differentiated investment emerging market . talked payment example india . q - brian thomas nowak - philipp schindlergive another one , created product called file , file google , also launched india actually coming back u.s. 's getting -- think 're also 40 million monthly active range . one coming back u.s. really interesting , really interesting development well . product perspective . n't underestimate role existing product emerging market , number one . monetization aspect , advertising potential emerging market also interesting . look market , depends little definition .
