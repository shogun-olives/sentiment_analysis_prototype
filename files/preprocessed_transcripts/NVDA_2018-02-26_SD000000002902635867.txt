right . good morning , everybody . 'm joe moore , 'm happy today colette kress , chief financial oﬃcer nvidia . start , let read disclosure really quickly . please note important disclosure , including personal holding disclosure morgan stanley disclosure , appear morgan stanley public website www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures registration desk . question answer colette , thank much . 's definitely lot going guy , always . maybe could start gaming kind go right . gaming , 53 % revenue . 've pretty exciting product launch little bit inventory correction around . 've talked business sort peaked $ 1.8 billion . $ 1 billion last quarter . kind talk 's happening -- maybe could frame term said consumption level ? sure . finished q4 result fiscal year . probably ended little bit differently hoped end overall year . took opportunity kind describe dynamic saw term gaming throughout year think move new fiscal year . one part sat back looked essentially past first cryptocurrency wave ended essentially end q1 last year . went looked saw q2 , q3 , q4 well 're guiding term q1 averaged period time take look term think q - joseph lawrence moore - colette m. kress q - joseph lawrence moore - colette m. kress q - joseph lawrence mooreoverall gaming business , overall gaming demand period time . probably post-cryptocurrency shipped higher overall underlying demand q2 q3 last year . however , q4 q1 , 're going reverse , 're going say 're going ship le believe overall demand end market happening term gaming . period time though , average , came together considered baseline overall gaming business approximately $ 1.4 billion expect grow going forward . period time , last 1.5 quarter , opportunity ( launch ) new wave overall turing architecture . turing architecture opportunity u bring ray tracing overall gaming business . important part u making sure healthy channel , channel absorb new product well important part . think set drive within fiscal year '20 . okay . $ 1.4 billion kind trailing rate consumption grow time catch ? right . ? okay , make sense . talk little bit got much inventory ? know mentioned crypto certainly shortage around . seemed like guy described oem business largely serving crypto . n't much gaming . number actually bore . look hash rate cryptocurrencies , n't seem like much incremental gaming . shortage created incremental demand channel fill ? think inventory got big ? yes . cryptocurrency wave ended quite sharply end q1 year ago . little bit q2 . happened overall wave extended higher price overall channel , higher overall manufacturer's suggested retail price period , therefore inﬂuenced underlying demand . people first -- channel kept price little bit higher n't really bring back fast enough u track overall demand period . demand , therefore , le expected , led u higher overall excess inventory channel period time . great . want talk important new product maybe inventory discussion . talk 1660 launched last week . pretty compelling kind mid-range , budget-priced product . - colette m. kress q - joseph lawrence moore - colette m. kress q - joseph lawrence moore - colette m. kressjuxtapose everything else 's going older 1060 product newer 2060 product ? yes . excess inventory channel , expected take approximately 1 2 quarter get . expect end quarter 're today , depleted overall excess inventory channel pascal mid-range ( inaudible ) . enabled u start new term turing architecture different price point attract area well . ce , announced 2060. 2060 price point $ 350 , great overall price realize overall ray tracing overall gaming . commented , 've announced also 1660 ti . come price point $ 279 , also great performance improvement pascal probably 35 % . even widely increased term performance maxwell . , key important volume skus attract market north america also term china . 're excited bring turing stack great price point . okay . guess look april quarter guidance , understanding , product , guess people asked , `` guidance conservative , given product kind price point 's turing-based ? '' even ( development ) , product every level . maybe inventory 1060 n't hurt much . respond ? obviously knew gave guidance . yes . looked overall guidance , , need keep mind still work overall inventory channel . slight overlap dove new turing product . , know , still period time allow overall sell- occur start selling overall channel . believe given q1 guidance , 's little bit lower overall base -- overall run rate , definitely inﬂuences overall year overall growth . think we'll start stepping back finish q term growth , term latter half year well . okay . great . maybe talk little turing , new capability , real-time ray tracing . , kind technology really exciting prospect . talk importance ? obviously , bring something 's breakthrough capability market , really programmed optimal usage . see term enthusiasm ( developer well ) ? q - joseph lawrence moore - colette m. kress q - joseph lawrence moore - colette m. kressray tracing overall turing architecture super , super opportunity , believe next-generation gaming , next-generation gaming probably expected hit 10 year future . 're bringing based overall performance availability 've established overall platform . opportunity essentially change essentially people absorb overall gaming cinematic type overall game , picture true real term 're seeing . 're correct . little bit chicken egg . hardware , overall architecture , software enables overall ray tracing brings overall content area . great set game already come , including battlefield v ; including anthem , really using dl ; well term metro exodus , also available . 'll see game future come take advantage overall ray tracing . breakthrough technology , , similar see term programmable shading 10 year ago . see future go forward . great , thank . 'm getting signal people ca n't hear . could turn mics little louder , would great . aspect turing , guess , get ray tracing support , mentioned dl , deep learning super-sampling . talk ? seems like go long way really boosting performance higher-end ray tracing product even start implement ray tracing . correct . overall ray tracing create overall beautiful picture may take overall frame rate refresh little bit lower . established dl , essentially bringing ai overall gaming piece overall filling pixel 2 point overall use ai . overall get back overall performance level would likely seen overall ray tracing . great piece technology , taking much learning term data center using ai . 're excited also bring overall gaming . pervasive expect dl ? diﬃcult ? seems like guy lot work creating driver . 's also -- 's taking little get game . long take ? guess , look holiday season year , pervasive expect dl ? piece work term working overall software thing . overall software developer -- develop work 're . also helping along . 's actually bit joint work going . , point time bring new technology , may certain stage term building game . keep mind working 're middle project . see newer game come q - joseph lawrence moore - colette m. kress q - joseph lawrence moore - colette m. kress q - joseph lawrence moore - colette m. kress q - joseph lawrence mooremarket later , 'll able get beginning overall development cycle 'll probably move quite faster overall market . okay . mean , turing , 've said , 's little bit slower start hoped . seems like remain pretty confident second half year , 're level 'd hope . . think expectation turing overall launch little bit higher actually came . lot thing likely inﬂuenced term overall macroeconomic condition may , north america , possibly elsewhere term overall china . , still great overall sale . 's expectation overall higher . excess channel inventory probably also caused part expectation met . ability provide full stack turing available , way super , super top end lower end , fuel overall market opportunity turing . okay . great . question get lot china , know pretty big market gaming business . number challenge , sort general macro slowdown . 's issue game getting approval . see region ? demand coming back important part forecast ? indicated end q4 , possibly macro condition china allow u realize full potential term china , term believe underlying demand overall gaming . 's tough point one issue term regulatory , term game approval impact term excess channel inventory . , leaving q4 behind u 've launched new product , new product term 2060 , there's tremendous great review . 's tremendous excitement . still early u see . 're finishing chinese new year . 'll look see well chinese overall demand come back . okay . 1660 pretty well reviewed far well . absolutely . - colette m. kress q - joseph lawrence moore - colette m. kress q - joseph lawrence moore - colette m. kressthe 1660 ti . okay . great . guess , final gaming question . gross margin , 've kind unusual environment last quarter really high-end product clearing inventory low end . get little bit mix . get little bit gross margin pressure april quarter sort artificially inﬂated last quarter ? discussed , overall gross margin , largest contributor term gross margin mix , mix across segment also mix -- inside segment . thing change quarter-to-quarter . long term , 've seen u consistently work improving overall gross margin , long term , done . okay . great . maybe could shift gear talk hpc cloud , data center business , 25 % sale . obviously , 've several year really explosive growth . quarter 14 % , sound like 's lumpiness business . 've seen pause elsewhere vendor cloud well . talk little bit visibility segment right describe 're seeing u ? yes . end q4 , n't see deal hoped would close end quarter close , really drove overall sequentially term q4 overall data center . time , visibility high look forward near future . however , believe intact key priority hyperscales well enterprise need data center . think priority , 're tremendously aligned , aligned slowdown overall moore 's law force look new accelerated compute opportunity . goal improving overall ai term also really key important . short term , visibility , probably high . move term second half year , believe would restore overall visibility well demand that's data center . guess talked segment within hpc cloud . 've got high-performance compute . 've got enterprise business gtx family . 've got cloud exposure . really thing sort simultaneously saw acceleration anything stand ? always tremendous great piece data center accelerating quite well time . experience , example , overall dgx business phenomenal last year , really helping people take q - joseph lawrence moore - colette m. kress q - joseph lawrence mooreend-to-end overall high-end system , incorporating different framework software , well significant amount compute .
