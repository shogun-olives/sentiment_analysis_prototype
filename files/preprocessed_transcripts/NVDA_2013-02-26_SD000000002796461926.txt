right . thank much . 'd like rob csongor , investor relation vp nvidia , talk thing graphic tegra . apologize . need give quick safe harbor start . please note important disclosure , including personal holding disclosure morgan stanley disclosure , appear morgan stanley public website www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures , registration desk . , maybe could start u , give kind minute overview nvidia 's position market . bunch question ask ? okay , sure . guess would start , arguably one toughest year , think , pc market , one thing always like mention people right get whatever newest headwind nvidia , able achieve record year . record revenue , record gross margin , record cash . announced dividend . repurchased share . record year tegra . said would grow tegra business 50 % . n't know business tech last year grew 50 % . despite one lousiest year , think , memory pc market . one toughest environment mobile . think point last year -- last year versus , mean , started last year ﬂood thailand . supply issue 28-nanometer tsmc . android market -- rough start , would say . time , really n't low-price point , $ 199 , quad-core tablet . thing , basically , developed year . think 're proud . 're proud able execute . think one thing n't often 'd like highlight showcase fact 've executing pretty well pretty tough headwind last four year . think one number one question get , company , possible gpu business grow pc market ﬂat declining ? we've trying show street little transparency business show , really , 5 % pc market , represents pc gaming , work station . high-performance computing , really drive majority business term gross margin . segment market robust . look last four year , gpus grown consistently . grew gpu business 8 % last year , excluding chipset business , 're exiting . already talked tegra business . think going year , position year versus last year night day . last year fermi , fermi generation gpus . year kepler . last year n't real design android disarray . year good year established position tablet . last year lte modem . . would say probably one significant development term position better last year . week announced tegra 4i , first integrated lte processor , mobile processor . open fair amount mobile market u . focus acquisition icera . point 're extremely pleased roughly 20 month acquiring icera world-class integrated lte processor 're engaging market . announced tegra i500 ce . right , family product application processor side start best-of-class app processor , well lte modem . additional integrated part allows u address larger segment phone market . think , going forward year , would say 's lot question . also announced surprise year . new gpu business , new growth business gpus , called grid . selling gpus cloud . server-based product , basically grid enterprise , grid professional . grid gaming . 're going talk lot new segment new business upcoming gpu technology conference , well investor day april 11th . course , term core business , would say year status business going forward year , think kepler year , pc gaming continues strong robust , think notebook , notebook market see declining . 're looking forward another year good share notebook . q - joe moore - rob csongorthe quadro business , declined last year amount , finally transitioning kepler . may noted q4 quadro business 10 % several quarter relative weakness . -- tesla growth business u right , one growth opportunity , sell gpus high-performance computer . think relatively , year year , would say 's kind quick summary state business think 're looking forward next year beyond , versus last year . question answer right , 's great . nvidia , , one intriguing stock cover , sense 's lot opportunity diﬃcult model , diﬃcult know exactly 're worth . yet seem pretty exciting . i'd like walk . 'll go product portfolio leave time question end . may get everything . think mundane thing could really work guy graphic . think -- 'm pretty bullish attach rate commentary , gamer market continues robust . also , competition ? competitor , amd lot different thing stretched r & budget , spending money varying console . -- seems like they're stretched little bit thin . time guy putting money pc graphic sort accelerate away ? well 'm smiling 're right person 's asked 're spending money pc graphic . frankly , point , 're position right leveraging investment made kepler . 're going enjoy second . think gained lot share year , thanks kepler . think 'll enjoy good share coming year . 're going enjoy benefit kepler throughout year . , said . people always ask amd , 've telling people amd n't -- amd . expect fight hard ever . far 're concerned , said last year said -- we're saying year , expect nothing different , nothing different . q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moorethey competition gpus . 're going fight hard year last year . hard fought year . 's change . great . . , way , know took u year develop kepler right ? instead game console instead xbox 360 wii , developing tegra . developing grid . developing virtual gpu capability gpus . developing cuda high-performance computing . -- pick choose invest . make sense . , grid , , n't lot number around grid model . mean , talk grid could play revenue opportunity guy ? , ultimately , paying . much 're going pay . big could ? well short answer , ca n't tell today . . 're going talk lot grid year . coming soon , fact . upcoming gpu technology conference , 're actually -- 're opening financial community . jen-hsun actually going give presentation immediately following keynote specifically targeted investment community . okay . -- 're going talk lot new business nvidia . lot way , nvidia 's business changing quite bit . yes . , know 's lot question new business . sometimes 's better u get -- make little headway market , establish customer stuff , roll guy say , hey , guess think . - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongorso 're going tell today model . 'm going tell model today . , obviously , believe one -- -- let talk little bit , maybe qualitatively . grid divided three . grid enterprise product . think value proposition grid enterprise 'll accelerate existing vdi implementation . 'll accelerate existing citrix vmware type setup . good news 's obviously market vdi . used , 's convenient good . could use little performance boost . acceleration , particularly graphics-intensive application . 's 've done . 've worked closely citrix vmware cisco guy accelerate existing implementation . think 's going -- think 's market . second market little bit tougher one try size . 's -- 're -- called grid professional 're deploying , basically , -- 're working partner accelerate deliver certain specific application saas , software service . application like solidworks autodesk . third one grid gaming . one 's potentially large business . demonstrated 've demonstrated stage somebody 's simply interacting television . 's game console connected . 's pc . 's set-top box . 's television ethernet wire . look perspective 's available market nvidia deliver goodness gpu , 's gone pc large power supply gpu display 's connected internet . , arguably , bigger console market term way people looking -- 's potentially -- let 's -- mean , n't gone positioned console competitive . announced partner . 're interesting partner , they're actually working carrier actual implementation , right ? q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe mooreyes . announced number middleware partner . people industry , know exactly middleware guy . people , think n't know . right . look closely , realize guy building lot infrastructure large service provider carrier . okay . great . 's helpful . tegra 4 , 's lot back forth best product apps processor . probably little cynical tegra 4 announced . 've put pretty impressive stats , mean , much lower power consumption , use case , higher number design win point tegra 3 life . -- , think , 's making compelling sale . broaden beyond tegra 3 ? well tegra 4 's position fastest -- world 's fastest mobile processor . 's anchor position . anchor position last year tegra 3. difference last year world 's fastest mobile processor without modem . world 's fastest mobile processor without modem , can't sell lot phone . could sell -- , , sold tablet . 's saw . business grew 50 % , jumped tablet market able grow , really , couple design . year , 're going see lot tablet lot skus vendor , lot ﬂavors . everything , think , android world going better -- functionality lower price , offering , option . think 're going see lot connected tablet year , telco carrier offering modem support , basically , family plan thing . basically throw , opposed get new bill every month . let 's see , else ? well talking idea -- ? yes , mean , 's worth noting high market share last year . - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor oh , right , right . merchant market , limited , samsung apple much share . , mean , guy -- swept almost everything else , window rt stuff -- 's right . -- well lot tablet . 's right . tegra 4 position relative tegra 3 , , , yes , -- think benchmark result talking , reestablished position fastest mobile processor . difference lte . right . modem . i500 selling sampling . think week first phone guy announced . think zte announced week 're building tegra 4 phone . 're building upcoming phone also tegra 4 , well . 's i500 . okay . think 'll see announcement , particularly phone side , later year get closer production . , big news , obviously , u week tegra 4i . right . q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongorso think -- quick answer question , nvidia 's entering connected device market year , think significant thing far beyond phone . think -- come lte modem . think tricky investor , 're used thinking existing field baseband competitor . guy relatively news . go ask competitor think kind software-defined approach taking icera , 're cynical , 're competitor , maybe . talk -- give u comfort going something large presence . mean , sound like 're sort second guy market lte space . right ? going -- would expect turn type baseband market share position number two would . well think secret sauce . mean , architectural strategic position . position software-defined radio , opposed fixed-function device . implication pretty significant . mean tegra 4i half size competing product qualcomm . 's pretty significant . prove . get qualified . prove going battery test 're familiar . couple design last year , phone tablet kind cut teeth get . many people , may think first product nvidia . , mean , icera 's making modem since 2006. yes . 95 different carrier qualification large number country . 're , familiar process first modem . okay . q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe mooreso think end day , 's devil 's detail . yes . deliver advanced feature . deliver performance . deliver low power , think 'll make -- think 'll fine . 're mobile world congress week , 's exactly 're showing . okay . fact 've qualified already data , mean , , , fairly relevant , still tablet opportunity thing ( inaudible ) . sure . , competition say , yes . 's voice . right . anyway , course . mean , 've done voice qualification . yes . -- tablet use right asus vivo rt lte modem . 's icera lte modem . mean , 's obviously -- announced last year . yes . data modem qual . voice qualification , take longer , harder get carrier comfortable ? - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore yes . take longer . okay . yes . voice qual typically take longer . 's people 've asked , would describe year , mean , nvidia 's perspective , extremely exciting time 're engaging connected device market market -- market welcoming alternative solution . think u , going , 's exciting . term device , visibility , term revenue , think year primarily build validate year , build certify . okay . look revenue , think 's mostly -- least phone , really going 2014. okay . great . formally announced grey last week , tegra 4i . right . emailed . lte integrated quad-core a9 . could feel smoke coming email like , , 's much . maybe could tell u view ? yes . 's email kind super-glued two together 's . 's -- never going show -- harm -- - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor never going show engineering department email , would insult . yes , mean , tegra 4i focus . talked earlier . 'm kidding . focus everything -- 's number one focus product since acquired icera . product designed one purpose one purpose , nail perf per square millimeter perf per watt . looked chip , looked complete top-down re- architecture taking everything , best everything 've learned far . modem side relatively easy . 's pretty much i500 . rest pretty diﬃcult , though . mean , 's basically custom architecture . number potential engine could use . tegra 4 graphic engine . new second generation four-plus-one , basically battery saver , ability single core running low power . second generation implementation . basically , look tegra 4i , tegra 4 graphic engine , 60- core instead 72. -- us chimera computational photography engine tegra 4. different cpu architecture , though . basically created custom , souped-up version . , looking perf per square millimeter , perf per watt . could go quad a15 could go quad a9 , 1.0 gigahertz , original engine . variant built , internally refer r4 . 's custom co- developed arm basically souped-up cortex a9 four-plus-one , clocked 2.3 gigahertz . 's -- sweet spot , believe , perf per square millimeter . translate term price phone enabling . well target , everything 've -- kind look market , least , similar -- look strategy analytics market research firm look , -- anything , like , $ 200 , $ 299 , super phone . address discrete gpu . large segment market believe opening u $ 99 $ 199 range market , quite low end , low end 's kind currently addressed company like mediatek . $ 99 $ 199 . segment , 's u qualcomm . q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongor fully capable lte smart phone price point . right , fully -- mean , basically 're looking , sweet spot market next year 1080p lte smart phone . okay . great . question audience ? , . ( inaudible ) . sorry , talk r & investment profile ? 's clearly lot investment thing like kepler tegra . right . ( inaudible ) , et cetera . mean , know -- got past peak r & investment profile ? yes . 's good question . mean , get question opex . last year grew opex , targeted $ 1.4 billion non-gaap . came underneath . basically spent exactly said 'd spend . q1 , opex went , pretty much exactly expected , -- earnings call recently , articulated reason . we're bringing lte market . absolutely right thing . , term r & expense , project currently plate funded r & project . 're -- , obviously , know built shield last year , example , -- paying engineer build last year . term kepler , shield , grid , lte -- product basically product funded last year 's opex . increase q1 largely based taking lte market , -- mean , time . think , general , look profile , opex percentage revenue , think last four year 'd see 're pretty consistently right around 31 % . time , 've grown operating income considerably . operating income four year ago -- opex 31 % percentage revenue . q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - unidentified participantbut operating income 8 % . grew 20 % . -- yes , 've spent every year , term percentage revenue , stayed pretty ﬂat . we've grown income quite bit time . yes ? 'm going let joe pick . guy typically pretty reluctant talk project denver . i'm wondering view , maybe big picture wise , arm server market segment think guy best capability play ? sort broad brush give u ? first assumption correct . yes . 're talking lot project denver right . think , relatively shortly . mean , -- thing 've disclosed 've talked thing probably already know . n't think 's secret power important thing cell phone battery . think people know exaﬂop initiative , initiative build exaﬂop supercomputer year 2018 , number one technical obstacle building supercomputer power . anyone 's familiar supercomputer server data center market know power major obstacle hurdle achieving breakthrough . 've , obviously , invested lot high-performance computing , parallel computing , cuda . lot experience deploying next-generation supercomputer . guy know q3 launched titan , world 's fastest supercomputer , driven 18,000 gpus . 's , obviously , segment market care lot . , today , implementation x86 . 've disclosed we're working something called project denver arm-based product . thing 've said 's general purpose 64-bit cpu , somebody -- somebody started propagating information , oh , 're going go general purpose cpu business . mean , nvidia never . never -- never general purpose cpu . typically , 're going go find diﬃcult problem build something custom solve problem . 's typically diﬃcult . , n't -- 's whole lot 're talking yet . hopefully soon . april , stuff , would come post-april ? - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongor q - unidentified participant - rob csongor n't know honest answer . think -- upcoming gpu technology conference , 're going hear lot grid think right , term milestone new opportunity nvidia , , obviously , enough right . grid one think lot people interested . 're already generating revenue 're already kind well along alpha customer . time u talk business probably coming . time one . okay . look high-margin quadro workstation business . relationship big boy coming competition , think , 's pretty high margin business surprise upside , think ? okay , big boy talking ? mean biggest boy world . biggest boy world ? n't know . intel showed interest -- oh , tesla business . yes . oh , -- yes . okay , sorry , thought said quadro . q - joe moore - rob csongor q - joe moore - rob csongorso question tesla , right ? okay . continue believe tesla business represents great growth opportunity nvidia . 's relatively slow developing 's new paradigm new way compute . early adopter tesla business predominantly lot -- university supercomputer . case , custom work people , basically . revenue lumpy . 'll installation kind -- installation 's done revenue drop . may noticed last quarter , done titan installation , revenue went . quite -- n't go way . difference 're starting develop run-rate business . definition run-rate business , designer designing landing gear open newest version ansys , one standard physical simulation . off-the-shelf product bought dell , poweredge server something like . simply accelerated tesla without knowing , off-the-shelf software , off-the-shelf hardware . know mean ? n't write code develop code . think 're seeing pickup run rate business . intel coming market , first , course , validates market , u . think intel anything unless think big potential market . think simply ca n't ignore benefit high-performance computing . think help u . help u validate market . meantime , six seven year code writing 've think competition catch . unfortunately , , wrap . 're time . okay . thanks much , rob . appreciate . right . thanks lot . thanks , joe .
