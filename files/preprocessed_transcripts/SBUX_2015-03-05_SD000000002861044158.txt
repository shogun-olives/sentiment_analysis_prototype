's always balance . want make sure believe 're adding value customer . n't want intrusive . getting balance right important . 'll always try safe side line , significant opportunity . point , keith , think 's important -- think 's significant opportunity continue grow msr . back half last year , msr growth rate ï¬‚attened little bit . bunch thing turn around . got traction recent quarter . switching food , spent time together fall , clear disappointed . pleased la boulange contribution comp . think role food next couple year ? still significant room ? check driver ? could continue drive traï¬ƒc , maybe , off-peak day part .

's great . even within , 've launched breakfast sandwich kind umbrella year ago . 29 % year . launched new breakfast sandwich , double smoked bacon , 's great start . still way , whether 's sku swap-out selective sku expansion , limited time offer . food something 've done . think go . help morning day part , , obviously , biggest piece business . look transaction ticket comp around food continue grow morning . percentage basis , lunch really biggest opportunity . necessarily dollar percentage . 've grown food lunch last two quarter , 15 % . decompose cliff 's doubling revenue , 's probably range need quarter . necessarily every quarter . somewhere teen food growth lunch . lunch early day far inï¬‚uence la boulange up-leveling food . say last year 've done thing like add bistro box , up-level panini . 's resulted afternoon day part , let 's call 11 3 , lunch afternoon fastest-growing day part u comp perspective quarter last couple year . keith stegner scott maw keith stegnerso even la boulange rolled bakery . started working lunch , customer already telling u 're relevant lunch , we're convenient , good food selection . think kind authority .

's early day lunch . evening would argue 30 evening store really n't even gotten started yet . food platform evening pretty exciting 's totally different . 's generally small shared plate . still get food get day part starbuck 's small shared plate evening -- bacon- wrapped date , truï¬ „ e macaroni cheese , focaccia bread pizza , thing like . ticket store really mixed . small group come , someone get beer , wine , 'll share small plate two food . someone order espresso tea . clear -- , let 's say , slower day part , evening , afternoon , leveraging tea , leveraging evening , leveraging beer , wine , food , et cetera , think comp trajectory next couple year , stuff start hit add [ ph ] , little check , little traï¬ƒc , right ? keep piece comp potentially growing , leveraging slow day part .

's still share u capture , 's still geography u expand -- maybe necessarily new city , obviously , u . within city think we're increasingly finding 's plenty room starbuck 's . one thing give u confidence around unit growth looking different format . small format part larger format well . whether 's store downtown disney , reserve forward store , referencing back roastery , larger-format store , coffee-forward store going part mix , going forward . drive-through-only store , really n't small format much convenience taking advantage pad industrial area transitional area drive additional traï¬ƒc . small format , really mostly urban environment , opportunity either oï¬ „ oad store 's really busy , frankly , pick foot traï¬ƒc , tried put full-size starbuck 's store , would diï¬ƒcult afford make work . , understand get ahead unit growth . 're lot work front end back end make sure every one store least expected business case . dis-aggregate everything . n't look anything average . 're always looking store over-perform , call `` green tail . '' store maybe little bit target , `` red tail , '' try understand . improve 're modeling standpoint . think 's important understand look unit growth u . even look current year , built 250 new company-owned store . couple hundred license store . 're expanding u , 's split pretty evenly -- capital partner ' capital store like target kroger safeway 're happy distribution footprint . 're happy get real estate could n't get get royalty . think partner quite happy 're seeing . keith stegner scott mawso switching , like , operational hookup potential side -- growth 've , added store , asked partner , 's clear 're right heart center . talked little bit partner-facing tech . also program making life better partner , better wage , benefit , self-expression , right ? think , wal-mart raising wage , 're raising wage , talked mcdonald 's couple minute ago -- 's cost securing keeping talent help maintain service differentiation ? right . maybe 'll talk operational complexity first . get wage question . get lot question operational complexity . think accident number-one strategy putting partner coffee first . making sure always remember starbuck 's make u different , first , employee store . fact source , roast . serve finest coffee world . move adjacent category , end day , we're making sure reinforce roastery 've built seattle , 're reserve clover , flat light recently introduced . look complexity , want use word , 've added , morning day part . la boulange up-leveled food . part item look . warming breakfast sandwich , 're warming breakfast sandwich extent 's warming , want call complexity , guess .

's consistent every quarter . move around . take last three year . 's pretty big number japan . economy ï¬‚attish , 's -- retail environment keith stegner scott maw keith stegner scott mawtough . feel good . think lean maybe either bit . real opportunity japan channel 're really , 're small way .

're getting fewer fewer . couple major one left . understand quite profitable , part ongoing plan ? could maybe expect see continued cleanup structure ? , like , option present , consider ? think , maybe , remaining jv structure ? think 's latter . think 's thing start make sense u . thing make sense jv partner , either 've buying selling , think point . star align , sit . talk . see get right price . 's master plan say date time 're going buy sell . think 've proven last year , sometimes star align . 'll think right . switching operating margin -- talked . think consolidated operating margin outlook next couple year , way often phrase `` several ten basis point operating margin expansion year , '' right ? outlined $ 1 billion worth cost save analyst day investor day next couple year . get $ 1 billion save within organization ? important thing understand 're starting . every year last year , even came starbuck 's , troy sat supply chain said , `` 've seen plan rollout business cost good sold 're assuming . cost good sold largest expense , imagine . want want give challenge go take cost supply chain . '' keith stegner scott mawand challenge building bit every year . last year $ 150 million . billion dollar extension addition challenge . year little $ 200 million . see quickly progress $ 1 billion run rate . 's important understand 's real rate saving . come , give p & l business unit . 're counting supply chain deliver p & l . n't run rate , 's fixed asset , 's cost avoidance . come current rate level . think $ 200 million year certainly doable , get u almost $ 1 billion . think year raise little bit push way $ 1 billion . 's thing could guess around , increasing sourcing saving . 's amount present every year contract renew . sourcing team going deeper far better job trying understand structurally change within starbuck 's . vendor need change . drive saving . gave example investor day , thought good one rolled la boulange , imagine , pascal team went . looked recipe . actually went every manufacturer , every supplier . made sure could deliver recipe . simpler , higher quality , natural recipe , right ? recognize ingredient ingredient list croissant . thought , given up-leveling preparation , up-leveling product , cost would go little bit . forecast . team went , actually kind stripped entire process stud looked everything going process . got better quality product little bit lower price . opportunity see sourcing team . opportunity transport good , moving full truckload transportation grow . thing around warehousing storing green coffee transporting green coffee . add almost $ 200 million year . another area think consensus , say , held back maybe reaching target emea operating margin . talk maybe potentially reaching 20 % . consensus . walk , maybe , mix business franchise versus company ? sale leverage ? realistic target ? maybe long take get ? keith stegner scott mawi think approach 20 % five year , really believe . n't want say automatic math . 'll give piece go . 's certainly mix shift towards licensed store . virtually , store open -- licensed meal . 'll start open company-owned store , 's still opportunity . lot cost-saving opportunity , keith , come . thing like store closure , re-franchising . 'll deal around . big early opportunity executed . kris engskov , run region team , done great job supply chain cog . support cost looking individual country center taking money way . run rate . 's really operational execution . think perhaps encouraging thing see 've mid single digit comp rate largest company-owned market . uk , germany , france , last quarter , 's big single-digit comp .
