thank . hello welcome 8th annual aws : invent . awesome . favorite time year . 're 65,000 peer . know , aws : invent sale marketing conference , 's learning education conference . everybody 's favorite part week breakout session . year , different . 3,000 , led partner customer . get real scoop platform . going need every minute 3 hour scheduled . lot , including thing good end . 'm going get right giddy . thinking throwing conference back 2012 , spent lot time debating name conference . decide like chose . intentional . reason chose name reﬂected seeing time , incredible number large small company alike way inventing pace inventing many large enterprise completely reinventing customer experience , aws cloud lynchpin . see look million active customer using platform today . look 's happened last six year , enterprise dramatically changed view cloud adopted aws cloud every imaginable vertical business segment : financial service , see capital one , goldman sachs , barclays , hsbc , intuit , commonwealth bank australia ; life science health care , see merck , pfizer , bristol-myers squibb , johnson & johnson , novartis , astrazeneca ; manufacturing , ge schneider electric siemens philip ; energy , shell bp hess halliburton . every imaginable vertical business segment using aws cloud meaningful way . also see public sector 7,000 government agency worldwide using aws , 10,000 academic institution 25,000 nonprofit . broad adoption . reason bigger company started moving cloud 's happened last 12 13 year start-ups completely disrupted long-standing industry , largely standing start top aws . often time reel number start-ups using platform . successful start-ups last 13 year built business aws . 'll give example think illustrate 'm talking term revolution . think old day needed taxi . called taxi company dispatcher would sometimes pick . sometimes let ring forever . sometimes , 'd nice phone . sometimes , 'd rude phone . sometimes , taxi come said . never knew going come . get car , little bit filthy . think experience today completely revolutionized company like lyft uber grab ola careem , totally different . look accommodation . wanted stay somewhere town , used always default hotel . look airbnb completely changed industry . 4 million active listing one time 2 million people night staying rental . 's crazy . think exercise . used use bicycle exercise . yes . go ride bicycle felt like dealing element . could go spin class . get car go go particular time . could bicycle home . 's little bit boring exercise . think , , peloton used technology completely change experience . every day , 20 livestreams . 10,000 on-demand stream look . 's totally changed way exercise . think delivery food . old day , unless lived new york city , thing got delivered pizza . company like doordash , grubhub postmates , get virtually anything delivered . believe , know , son one best customer . think , start-ups disrupted long-standing industry around long time really standing start . 's thought choose theme keynote today , kept coming back topic , question topic talk company , think transforming . reinvent business customer experience meaningful sustainable long period time . transformation mean transforming , mean transforming meet new technology situation opportunity . transformation question # 1 question . thought would share think 6 critical component going make significant transformation . 's big change big transformation make . n't want procrastinate . n't get easier wait . fact , ditch get deeper . think type first element big type transformation like , turn 's technical . 's leadership . look company make transformation successfully versus talk , 4 differentiator . first actually need figure get senior team aligned 're going make change . 's easy make big shift like . inertia powerful thing . 's easy block various part organization , sometimes well- intended reason sometimes self-interested reason . 's easy block . n't find way senior management conviction alignment 're going make change find mechanism get issue table know 're making progress n't go several month road thinking 're making progress 're , make change . need senior level alignment . second thing need right alongside need aggressive top-down goal force organization move faster organically otherwise would . let give 2 counter example point . think several year ago , cio ge , jamie miller , decided thought critical ge move cloud move much quickly . got top technical leader together said , `` 're going move 50 application aws next 30 day . '' said 45 minute told dumb idea would never work . listened patiently said , `` hear . 're going . let 's go . '' got 42 application 30 day . along way , figured security model , governance model , compliance model success built momentum . sudden , idea started ﬂowing else move . they're 3/4 way moving several thousand application aws , second aggressive top-down goal would n't happened n't set goal forced company move . let give counter example . went go see company life science space . turned knew cio friend friend . 've never met . connection . got meeting . little bit late coming see u . ceo . cio came said , `` 'm going grab . '' think felt bad friend friend connection . said , `` infrastructure leader get room , tell 're together . '' said , '' well 're fine . 're much u . '' said , `` oh , definitely true . like know 're lot . heard 've got kind workload running . 're experimenting . 're kicking tire . '' said , `` well using 3 ec2 instance . '' said , `` oh , ca n't right . '' infrastructure leader came room . said , `` ( john ) , '' said , `` lot aws ? '' said , `` oh , yes , 're ton . 're kicking tire . we're experimenting , lot thing going . '' said , `` many ec2 instance using ? '' said , `` like 3 4 . '' said , `` 's mean lot . '' 's easy go long period time dipping toe water n't aggressive goal let organization know 's priority make transformation . way , cio went away 2 week later , set aggressive top-down goal . 're one top 5 life science customer today . need top-down aggressive goal . third thing got train people . lot time , conversation around table , senior people get excited , decide move cloud . come back company . say , `` good news . 's cloud . '' nobody experience using . 's hard use cloud . take little bit training . 's train hundred thousand customer every year . fourth thing 's important got make sure n't allow organization get paralyzed n't able move -- figure move every last workload . lot customer go portfolio analysis go application . 'll classify application easy move , medium hard move , go last dependency legacy , easily lifted shifted rearchitected move cloud . build thoughtful , methodical , multiyear plan migrate . company find almost always many workload relatively easily able move cloud get benefit . fact , inform lot later workload hardest one move . 've got make sure n't get paralyzed . first step transformation technical . 's much leadership . 's making sure senior level alignment , aggressive top-down goal force organization move faster otherwise would , right training thoughtful , methodical , multiyear plan make migration . find , company , make decision 're going make transformation move cloud , developer raring go . ready go . want broadest possible capability . n't want slowed . last year , talked `` want want . '' year , 're talking `` n't stop . 'm good time . n't want stop . '' decide company 're going make transformation cloud , developer want able move fast possible . want constrained . want capability need move everything want move build anything imagine . want broadest possible capability . 's nobody capability aws . 175 service . nobody close number service . 's number service , 's depth feature capability within service . 's lot noise . lot company who've become pretty good checkbox hero kind look something . rush say , `` , . '' look depth detail offering , 're pretty different . 'll see across major infrastructure component : compute , storage , database , analytics , machine learning , iot , robotics , messaging , content distribution , marketplace , people service , big difference . quote see , hear lot . one happens expedia . typically hear customer talk think 're couple year ahead functionality regard maturity . instance , container , network . 'm going spend lot time networking piece , part 'm going let surprised press release coming later today . also , dave brown going reveal lot -- detail new networking feature networking presentation wednesday . 'll say couple thing . first , n't compute without great network attached . wo n't find network functionality capability aws . look footprint pop ability get backbone , much broader footprint 'll find elsewhere . also network place direct connect on-premises data center aws . 's one 100 gigabit per second standard instance . also capable network hub , call transit gateway , allows connect on-premises data center aws also set across multiple aws vpcs different region . ability take connection . much throughput 'll find anywhere else . ability connect branch oﬃces easily aws 'll find elsewhere , branch oﬃces sd-wan integration . even multicast ip , nobody else , 're launching today . much broadly capable network 'll find elsewhere . 'm going focus comment compute , instance container . look instance , start , 's meaningfully instance anybody else . 's also 've got lot powerful capability within instance . powerful gpu machine learning trading instance , powerful gpu graphic rendering instance , largest in-memory instance sap workload 24 terabyte , fastest processor cloud z1d . 've got standard instance 100 gigabit per second network connectivity , instance processor choice intel amd arm base , different set capability instance side . look pace innovation aws , number instance 've built , 's totally accelerated significant way . 4x instance type today two year ago . couple reason 've able innovate much faster rate . first spent significant amount time couple year totally rehauling reinventing virtualization hypervisor layer . -- built system call nitro . look nitro , take virtualization security networking storage main server lightweight hypervisor customer instance give back cpu consuming , mean get performance indistinguishable bare metal much lower cost . also mean , we've taken piece main server put nitro chip built , innovate much quicker fashion n't -- every time make change one piece , n't changed lockstep . 's able add network optimized instance , instance . quickly , wo n't find elsewhere we've separated piece separable bunch . third thing security capability nitro also think meaningfully better , traditional hypervisors trusted domain , people often call dom0 . 're thing like able add vms agent troubleshooting . limited number people provider allow access trusted domain 's got customer instance . careful lock , et cetera . nitro , 've moved security main server separable nitro chip , mean lock main server customer instance . one access . n't worry control , 's accessible , much better security posture . first thing totally overhauled reinvented virtualization layer something called nitro , helped u innovate much faster rate . 'll see throughout conversation . second thing decided going design build chip . think history aws , big turning point u acquired annapurna lab , group talented expert chip designer builder israel . decided going actually design build chip try give capability . think lot company , including , working x86 processor long time . intel close partner 've increasingly started using amd well , wanted push price performance envelope , meant innovating . took annapurna team . set loose couple chip wanted build thought could provide meaningful differentiation term performance thing really mattered thought people really broad way . first chip started working arm-based chip called graviton chip , announced last year part a1 instance , first arm-based instance cloud . designed used scale-out workload . containerized microservices web tier apps thing like . 3 question wondering launched a1 instance . first anybody use . second partner ecosystem step support tool chain required people use arm-based instance . third innovate enough first version graviton chip allow use arm-based chip much broader array workload . first 2 question , 've really pleasantly surprised . see slide , number logo , load customer using a1 instance way n't anticipated . partner ecosystem really stepped supported arm-based instance significant way . third question whether could really innovate enough chip , n't sure . 's part reason started working couple year ago second version graviton even building first version n't know 're going able might take . 'm excited announce today launch new set instance : m6g , r6g c6g instance ec2 , new generation arm-based instance powered aws graviton 2. pretty exciting . provide pretty significant difference first version graviton chip . 64-bit customized core aws-designed 7-nanometer silicon . instance 64 vcpus , 25 gigabit per second enhanced networking 18 gigabit per second eb bandwidth . -- versus first graviton chip , 4x compute core , 5x faster memory overall 7x better performance first graviton chip . arguably , importantly , 40 % better price performance latest generation x86 processor . 's unbelievable think . 're excited give today . m6g available today . r6g c6g available early 2020. also , simultaneously , split piece annapurna team build second chip . , trying pick thing could totally change game regard use . started graviton 2 chip , 40 % better price performance get latest generation x86 , run virtually workload . 's huge game changer . also started working something thought would also game changer . 's really around machine learning . 've talked lot group year training machine learning . get lot attention . 're hefty load . instance perform best powerful machine learning trading p3 p3d instance . lot machine learning scale production like . lot inside room done , know majority cost actually prediction inference . think example , 'll take alexa example . train model couple time week . 's big old model . think many device everywhere making inference prediction every minute , 90 % -- 80 % 90 % cost actually prediction . want try work problem . everybody talking training . nobody actually working optimizing largest cost machine learning . announced last year keynote working inference optimized chip called inferentia . 'm excited announce today launch inf1 instance ec2 , backed new inferentia chip . inf1 instance lot thing excited . low latency . it'll 3x higher throughput . think , 3x faster throughput , 40 % le cost current best inference instance video chip , significant innovation team . 2,000 tera operation per second . we've integrated major framework , tensorflow mxnet pytorch . 's available today ec2 . 'll make available sagemaker ec eks early 2020. think instance , addition number instance powerful instance within category capability nitro innovate much faster clip , layer top desire willingness design build chip , give capability instance space unlike 'll find anywhere else . 's instance . let 's talk container second . increasingly , customer using container kind workload advent microservices architecture also make quicker faster people deploy . another area think container lot capability lot resonance elsewhere . look container cloud , 81 % run aws . 's significant part lot capability . provider effectively 1 container service , managed kubernetes service . 3. started building container service back 2014 really popular orchestration engine , customer said u , `` n't want container , want container deeply integrated rest aws platform capability . '' built something called elastic container service , ec , grown unbelievably fast continues weed lot customer like verizon gopro fox mcdonald 's , duolingo use . control development ec -- lot help lot input , thank much keep coming , please . control development ec , mean launch new feature integrate ec right get-go . customer want deeply integrated container service , choose ec . surprisingly , kubernetes became popular , lot customer wanted u something . look today , 84 % kubernetes run cloud run top aws . lot kubernetes customer . understandably wanted managed service . built elastic kubernetes service , eks , grown like weed well since launched couple year ago , really , really fast . customer say , `` well 's awesome choice 2 managed container service ec eks . would prefer worry server cluster . want manage container task level . '' 's built something launched couple year ago called aws fargate . fargate serverless container offering . 's offering like anywhere . tell u cpu memory want , upload container image fargate rest . deploys . rightsizes compute . server , cluster , provisioning . look popularity fargate , kind blow u away . thought people would interested . n't think anticipated broadly demanded . new customer year , new container customer aws , 40 % start fargate . 's 's much easier run container way . launched fargate support ec , , since control development ec , n't coordinate anybody . much easier . trying make work kubernetes easy . customer , understandably , use kubernetes said , `` well love idea fargate . wo n't make work kubernetes . '' 'm excited change right launch amazon fargate amazon eks . kubernetes customer able get serverless benefit running container aws . mean 4 container offering choose . like manage server cluster level want ﬂexibility stitch thing together , use either ec eks . want operate task level worry server cluster , use fargate either ec eks . exciting . make decision 're going transform going move cloud . get senior level alignment set aggressive top-down goal force org move , developer want go . n't want held back . want platform capability , fraction capability , capability , especially pay upfront . look across platform , bar people want . look compute , want number instance , powerful machine learning training instance , powerful machine learning inference instance , powerful gpu rendering instance , biggest in-memory instance sap workload , 100 gigabit per second connectivity standard instance , access different processor option . want one container , want multiple container managed level well serverless level . want network capability , functionality , david michael solomonbroadest footprint , best performance capability thing like transit gateway make much easier set global network . bar people want compute . one give aws . make , way . much easier , move existing workload also allow developer build anything imagine right tool right price quickly possible . may noticed walking dj playing music , often , keynote . -- year , 2 dj . woman dj male dj last 15 minute . 'm going actually bring stage male dj , whose dj name dj d-sol . he's actually going come talk music , although actually interesting thing say music , enjoyed selection tape . turn , dj ceo goldman sachs . -- 's true , yes . yes , 's awfully good dj-ing addition ceo . 'm going ask david solomon come stage share transformation goldman sachs making using aws cloud . david ? thank , andy . thank . good morning , everybody . one thing 'll tell , sure , fun today 15 minute 7:45 8:00 a.m. 'm really happy . 'm standing looking , world 's best technologist one biggest technology conference year . know 're wondering , 's head bank ? well world changing . saw ceo goldman sachs dj la vega . first time would say . let tell little bit we're using cloud technology change business . goldman sachs financial service company . provide advice , lend invest money , make market manage risk . stand middle market trillion dollar ﬂows . advise hundred & transaction year underwrite million stock bond offering . ultimately , help client achieve financial goal . care deeply client ' goal n't intangible , abstract thing , real-world problem . everything simple lending complex derivative trading serf real purpose like helping renovate kitchen finance expanding contracting business . finance simple , . reality finance much complex . goldman sachs ' job try simplify , make easy , intuitive effective possible . ? in-house , around 9,000 engineer make 1/4 38,000-person workforce . best engineer world working interesting problem . everything building trying make finance work better . cloud technology allows u job way 's simple , accounting complexity industry helping u ensure work safe , secure responsible . work cloud provider , aws first immense capability astounding pace innovation . year ago , colleague , roy joseph , stage talk work together develop bring key solution aws ' key management service , crucial data privacy development 's allowed u fully , organization , embrace cloud . nose . aws ' cutting-edge approach technology really unlocked something u . since , 've busy , help aws , building predominantly cloud- based business . want talk couple minute today . first credit card business . conversation client , realized credit card could much simpler thing . could provide consumer new way relate spending , repositioning credit card tool truly side . building credit card platform underpins apple card took number engineer long -- along strong partnership apple , mastercard , course , aws . would made sense u get business maintain field field on-prem data center . reason able deliver capability digitally scale cloud technology . apple card launched month ago . 's already one successful credit card launch ever . 's part marcus , digital consumer banking business , today three year old . although 're 150-year-old company , 're still new consumer finance . think 's pretty clear we're something . today , marcus , $ 55 billion retail deposit million client . 're putting cloud technology work area business well . big company make trillion dollar payment every day . right , space dominated legacy architecture , manual process slow turnaround time . next year , 'll launch transaction banking service , digital platform help corporation manage cash built entirely cloud-native stack provided aws . goldman sachs already using make billion dollar payment 5 currency every day , providing u enhanced transparency , tracking around cash ﬂows saving u lot time money process . we're eager client experience service look forward sharing detail rollout plan next year 2020. historically , financial technology powerful fast . 's lagged behind consumer high-tech term elegance simplicity . want bank account , wait fund clear . want loan , wait approval . would want advice company better manage balance sheet , send e-mail ask meeting . way . better . 're yet . finance perfect place take new technology immediate real- world impact . data scientist using ai machine learning technique year . 're already pushing research community consider andrew r. jassywhat 's possible apply quantum power -- quantum computing power financial problem . well goldman sachs , 's corporation , government , institution individual , 're also building developer . way go aws best-in-class cloud service , want first choice provide service enable build financial functionality directly application workﬂows . already institutional client , 're making capability powerful security database available directly platform called goldman sachs marquee . real power goldman sachs marquee lie scalable service access directly apis .

're going succeed small part work done continue amazon web service . still , job remain : assume burden complexity make finance easy , intuitive effective possible . want enable focus building thing could n't dream , thing change way world work better , sure , finance complex . never drag innovation . like aws goldman sachs , finance ever business accelerant . look forward seeing build together . thank , much . great day . thanks , david . really , 's honor u partnering goldman sachs . 're really excited 're together . thank partnership . 're making transformation make decision 're going make big move give developer access tool let make change quickly ﬂexibly , 's another thing got think , got think thing 're going take thing 're going leave behind making big move . 's people often call modernization . 's question company asking on-premises infrastructure many year . compare cloud cost capital ; 's expensive variable basis ; n't get elasticity ; n't near capability cloud ; 's launching 2,500 new service feature year ; spend scarce resource , engineer , thing undifferentiated heavy lifting ; n't security posture , objectively look whether want toil away refining on-premises infrastructure next several year , company saying , `` . thanks . 's moving , 'm moving . '' make decision 're going modernize , make lot decision decide 're going bring . 's little bit like moving home . look , 's mainframe . also look like 's audit notice licensing change pricing increase . well 're going move , decide 're going actually take 're going leave behind . turn company making big transformation , see bet . reconsider everything . thought would share biggest decision trend see modernization company making big transformation . first thing company trying move away mainframe quickly . every industry lot company mainframe . people want move away 're expensive 're slow they're complicated . hardly anybody mainframe skill anymore . fact , one story like one enterprise customer making big shift moving mainframe teasing apart moving aws . got last step needed find credential decompile something . could n't find anybody company credential . realize 1 person . woman retired 10 year ago , moved state , name ( ginger ) . able find . gave credential . made last step . ca n't always find ginger . people n't want using mainframe long term . lot customer moving away . see couple different pattern . see company basically tease whole thing apart microservices relaunch aws . 's western union . company methodically picking certain workload moving one one away mainframe . mainframe becomes le central kind life place nonessential task . 's company like vanguard allianz u.s. air force . make mistake , company trying move quickly away mainframe lot success . second thing see people move modernize older guard commercial-grade relational database . 've talked keynote year . people trying move away oracle sql server 're expensive , 're proprietary , high amount lock-in licensing term downright punitive . think n't meet customer n't looking ﬂee oracle . one thing 've seen last couple year change people trying get away sql server pretty quickly well . one reason see return way old microsoft 're prioritizing matter guy customer . let give example . many year , able take sql server license 'd bought bring license run want , relational database service example . one day , microsoft decided n't want let . good ? hell , . good microsoft ? maybe . think think . people sick tired pawn game . 's moving fast open engine like mysql postgres mariadb . get performance need open engine compare well commercial-grade database , 's hard . take lot work . lot amazon . 's doable . 's hard . 's asked u try solve issue , give database option work open engine comparable performance commercial-grade database . 's built amazon aurora , launched 2015. aurora version completely compatible postgres mysql . several time faster performance typical high-end implementation community edition . 's least durable performant available commercial-grade database . 1/10 cost . 's 's fastest- growing service history aws since inception 2015. 've got ten thousand customer using moving . 's broad list like bristol-myers squibb fannie mae electronic art astrazeneca liberty mutual nasdaq hulu verizon finra , broad group . 's pretty amazing u fast people moving aurora pace . mainframe , relational database . third area see lot modernization decision around moving window linux . happening several year anyway . idc estimate 2020 , 80 % workload deployed linux workload . linux grown 4x faster window . reason . first , people n't want pay tax anymore window particularly know price go frequently . second , turn , 's vibrant community around linux vibrant community around anywhere else feature security thing happen much quicker . third , , people n't keen one owner operating system especially 're prone raise price , happens lot , change licensing term . look window cloud , 57 % window cloud run aws . company owns operating system maybe n't crazy . decide change licensing rule . said , `` hi . new version window run dedicated instance cloud provider , '' trying stranglehold workload back platform . , n't think customer keen one company operating system 're building business , continue see people moving window linux . fourth area modernization see around partner choose . look isvs saas provider , adapt technology infrastructure platform work technology infrastructure platform . they'll doubt software work technology infrastructure platform . 2 , 3. start aws significant market segment leadership position . 's see much vibrant collection isvs saas provider aws 're moving cloud want capability . see -- salesforce run vast majority top aws workday splunk informatica infor acquia datadog databricks , much broader collection software 're moving cloud , use really easily top platform . interesting thing see company moving cloud -- often different system integrator 've used on-premises last number year . lot fact company , 're making big change , want work si 's really deep cloud platform lot dedicated trained professional platform . think lot large si dilemma they've big business outsourcing build practice hedge bet across lot different company . n't actually get deeper one platform , company taking risk moving get little bit nervous . 's big si think made shift pretty well done successfully . company like deloitte accenture . see lot heavy lifting moving enterprise cloud done si either pivoted model quicker realized future . company like slalom rackspace , born cloud si worry cannibalizing existing business happy pick small pilot project n't pay much . seem like 're worth . everybody know , ca n't move unless get pilot done successfully . 're willing bet future . company like onica clearscale u.s. cloudreach u.k. allcloud europe versent asia pacific lot heavy lifting . lot different choice partner people moving cloud well . think transformation , transformation : deciding 're going make move , energizing company make move , equipping developer broadest possible capability make move quickly successfully eﬃciently making hard decision 're going take new era versus 're going leave behind . also transformation really meeting new environment new technical challenge . think look age 're respect much data trying store process analyze , 's like nothing ever seen . different era 's existed past . 're world 're storing mostly gigabyte data sometimes terabyte . 're world 're consuming petabyte data sometimes exabyte . 's lot reason , borderless internet application reach everywhere much broader way possible . lot cloud much cost-effective accessible compute storage much faster get work done . company thrive new era much data using old tool 've used forever . adapting meet new technology challenge tool required . one challenge find company data 've accumulated long period time . unfortunately , live data silo place , make analytics machine learning painful , expensive slow . 's company excited able build data lake bring data together make analytics machine learning much easier . look people building data lake top , 's nothing come close approaching many data lake built amazon s3 , object store . reason people choosing s3 data lake base , first turn reliable scalable available anything else . lot multi-availabilities multi-az architecture take data 'll store multiple data center , typically 3. data center mile apart , 100 right low latency operate application . compare provider , either mostly region 's one data center multi-az capability , az live building 're right next door . 's problem building street , 's end availability durability story . different availability scalability . second , s3 secure data storage . 's lot example give . talk era giant data like , really want granularity actual object level . s3 , 's object store allows block public access bucket account level . 's object store give inventory report object answer question like , `` object encrypted ? '' 's object store allows analyze access permission object bucket feature launched yesterday called iam access analyzer . available , secure . also object store data lake give way get data . turn matter lot data coming everywhere . get wire . get direct connect , backbone , streaming iot , storage gateway , sftp 's want , snowball appliance , even 45-foot container snowmobile . almost every magical way imagine getting data wherever data lake , s3 significantly way 'll find elsewhere . thing aws actually give ability automate action , , think era 're , large data matter . look s3 intelligent-tiering , storage class unlike anything 'll find anywhere else , ass using machine learning-powered algorithm object hot le frequently accessed move warmer colder storage adjust price accordingly . 're operating hundred petabyte information , sometimes exabyte customer , n't want take operation across every single one object . want something like s3 batch operation let take action across object , , something wo n't find elsewhere . s3 lowest cost option s3 glacier deep archive . wo n't find anything ( cost effective ) . 's cheaper tape , way . thing find s3 . wo n't find capability elsewhere , many people choosing s3 data lake . think world data lake . lot customer large data lake , 's actually pretty challenging . application , place 're setting data ; data aggregated , normalized indexed reformatted . application trying access data lake lot people . person job decide application access data , 's complicated . 's stressful . capability identity access management , iam , give kind ﬂexibility . customer used ﬂexibility . different access policy object . configure need . people often make mistake . customer asked u would help find way simplify , especially age large data . 'm excited announce launch today amazon s3 access point , radically simplifies managing access scale application using shared data lake service . access point give customized path bucket unique host name access policy enforces specific permission 've set . 're ﬂexible . also access point lock access vpc access . lock network . think deciding access data amount data , make much easier . n't layer thousand top one bucket . assign different access policy application . scale much better . 're going make way fewer mistake , much , much easier . unique helpful feature 're building broad data lake . company moving data lake . tried couple year 'll continue try make easier easier manage large-scale data lake . s3 access point example lake formation announced last year keynote make much faster build data lake scratch another example . thing , end day , n't right analytic service , matter . want broadest capability analytics space . 's aws provided last number year . nobody selection analytics service . turn want ad hoc query unstructured data , use athena . want process vast amount unstructured data using dynamic cluster distributed framework like spark hadoop presto pig hive yarn , use emr . want superfast query structured data like data warehouse , use redshift . want analytics real-time streaming data , use kinesis . want bi beautiful visualization great embedded ml capability like find elsewhere , use quicksight . broad array analytics service . want go back redshift . launched redshift 2012 , really changed data warehousing space . first data warehouse built ground cloud . really changed pricing equation le $ 1,000 per terabyte . fastest-growing service aws first three year aurora launched . 's continued fast-growing service u . ten thousand customer using redshift . broadly used data warehouse cloud . company like electronic art aetna mcdonald 's yelp dow jones pfizer , intuit , liberty mutual . customer gravitating redshift significant part we're continuing iterate fast clip . look last year alone , redshift team added 100 feature . wo n't share . 'll touch think really mattered customer . first concurrency scaling , launched year ago , automatically add remove capacity based unpredictable demand . 's incredible many redshift customer already using concurrency scaling . give hour day free usage concurrency scaling , 97 % using using free . second , day ago , released materialized view , take frequent query precomputes cache aggregation filter even join table , make query go much faster . people pretty excited . third thing 've working year 2 something called spectrum refer lake house , really able query data stored locally node redshift . also across data lake s3 . surprisingly , people start querying across redshift s3 , also want able query across operational database lot important data set live . today , released something called federated query , let query across redshift , s3 relational database service , including aurora postgres . 're querying across data store getting aggregated data set redshift , customer want move data set back data lake want let analytics service machine learning service able use well . actually turn diﬃcult pain butt actually . kind work . 've made easy new query called data lake export we're releasing today well redshift . redshift continuing iterate fast clip based lot 're telling u matter . step back look redshift , 's broadly used data warehouse cloud . 's 2x faster anything else n't fudge benchmark . 's 75 % le expensive anything . yet , would argue look age data 're today fast forward even couple year exponentially amount data people storing trying process analyze going increase , looking around corner adjusting evolving allow want . 've thought lot space . one first thing told u , `` hi . look . really want able scale storage compute separately redshift . -- redshift instance storage compute contain , turn workload need storage , provision instance even n't need compute , want scale separately . '' seems like pretty reasonable request . 'm excited share way allow scale storage compute separately new redshift ra3 instance managed storage . ra3 instance fast , big ssds local instance . turn workload exceeds ssds -- amount storage ssds local instance , 've built technology intelligently automatically move le frequently accessed data s3 . nitro , like talking earlier , built unique instance fast bandwidth . actually need data s3 query , move much faster leave without high-speed bandwidth instance . ra3s , get separate storage compute . turn , way , local ssds 're using ssd local ssd , pay use . pretty significant enhancement customer using redshift . time , think prevailing way people thinking separating storage compute letting people scale separately way well 're going large-scale compute move storage bunch awaiting compute node , issue got think . first think much data 're going -- scale 're fast forward year , think much data 're going actually move network get compute . , large-scale networking capacity , multiple petabit per availability zone . 100 gigabit per second instance . large , scalable network . 's hard look around corner realize 's going saturate network point 's going slow performance . that's going real bottleneck . could get networking bottleneck , 'm sure let 's imagine maybe could , 've got second problem , look hardware trend , notice throughput ssds node ssds scaling growing 6x faster rate ability cpu process data memory . mean even get networking bottleneck , cpu wo n't able keep storage . mean 're going performance problem , unless decide provision compute .

'' training actually quite different lot different reason , least 're trying work across dozen dozen parameter . lot time , n't really know dimension really impacting model . looking trained model little bit like looking compiled binary understand application work . 's totally opaque . 's like gibberish naked eye . people want better idea 's driving model adjust fix . explain . 'm excited announce sagemaker debugger , allows developer debug profile model training improve accuracy machine learning model . debugger , 's default . 've done bunch work 3 major framework sagemaker . 's automatically setting metric want monitor see 's actually happening . capability debugger called feature prioritization . put spotlight actual dimension feature impact model . -- 3 useful thing . mean , first , actually know what's driving model , hugely helpful 're training model . second thing turn underperforming neural network model , might want know dimension 's leaving , could actually help understand 're getting prediction n't match think case . also , model feature prioritization show overly reliant number dimension , might bias model want change . useful help train , understand matter also able interpret model . easier manage notebook , experiment , debugging profiling capability . people say , `` help model working long period time . sudden , look like prediction relevant anymore ? '' happens sometimes , like take overly simplified example , let 's say built model 2016 , estimated housing price . well model worked well '16 . worked well '17 primarily condition . 2018 , interest rate changed housing price went , model stopped making accurate prediction . concept machine learning people call concept drift . 's actually , -- know 's concept drift , actually make change model . turn overwhelming majority model way complicated simple example gave . 's really hard find concept drift . kind data wrangling , look model -- data model trained ? 's model 're making prediction ? different ? changed ? ? 's really complicated . 're excited help solve today sagemaker model monitor , way detect concept drift monitoring model deployed production automatically . concept drift , 'll create set baseline statistic data train model . actually analyze prediction , compare data used create model . give way visualize appears concept drift , see sagemaker studio . take charge figure make adjustment 've got situation concept drift . thing mentioned , notebook , experiment , training debugging profile . concept drift , assuming building model . know whole bunch data set useful . people n't time wherewithal capability train model data set . simple example would , let 's say , operational database data set sale lead . lead actually ended becoming real sale . actually build simple model predicted variable , lead convert sale , would spend scarce resource follow-up particular opportunity . 's 's promise 've talked past something people call automl , automatic machine learning model , . couple problem , though , look automl model , people tried roll . first build okay , simple model initially total black box . turn want improve mediocre model want evolve 's something matter , matter business , idea model built . 's nothing . turn want make tradeoff , maybe case , may take absolute best accuracy . may trade little accuracy something like faster latency prediction , given nature application . 're luck . one simple black box model . customer said , `` want automl . want visibility . '' 'm happy announce sagemaker autopilot , automl full control visibility . automl , 's happens . send u csv file matt woodwith data want model point s3 location . autopilot transformation model put format could machine learning . selects right algorithm . train 50 unique model little bit different configuration various variable n't know one going lead highest accuracy . way , even know build machine learning model , train 50 model take quite bit time . useful . give sagemaker studio model leader board , see 50 model ranked order accuracy . give notebook underneath every single one model . open notebook , recipe particular model . tell built , tell configuration , tell parameter , tell algorithm . give whole recipe want take model evolve make something really change business long period time , . also , look model leaderboard 50 algorithm may look difference algorithm 1 algorithm 2. difference accuracy tiny . difference latency significant make application make prediction much quicker . may choose take one . autopilot , allows automl way let create model automatically give full visibility control able evolve model make trade-off . look sagemaker , today , sagemaker become c-level change ability build , train , tune deploy machine learning model . sagemaker studio , 's giant leap forward , first ide machine learning .

's incredibly exciting able reinvent search machine learning . , 'll hand back andy . thanks . thank , dr. wood , excited see kendra . look machine learning end end , said earlier , sometimes people trick thinking machine learning like service , single service . 's machine learning . need right highly secure , highly reliable , fully featured data store right access control , right security , broadest set analytics really robust offering 3 layer machine learning stack believe company modern technology capability future clearly operate 3 layer stack . 's machine learning 's needed . nobody set capability collectively like aws , twice many company using aws machine learning anybody else . think transformation , mentioned earlier , thing transform , thing transform meet new technical opportunity situation . one thing notice get first 5 piece transformation 've talked , oftentimes , people get addled ca n't figure move every last workload . workload must remain on-premises somewhere , cloud , sometimes stall plan make transformation . 's easy run hide angst big change 've got make . n't accomplish much . see type activity thought process sometimes various company hard task making big transformation ca n't figure move every last workload , n't know move forward sometimes . that's something tried help last number year continuing make easier customer . 'll mention 3 . first really around customer say , `` 'm moving overwhelming majority application cloud . workload stay on- premise , maybe close something like factory . help ? '' kind got started unusual deep partnership vmware joint offering spent bunch time together working launching called vmware cloud aws , allow customer use software tool 've used manage infrastructure via vmware on-premises . also use manage infrastructure aws . something customer excited . managed service vmware run sort like fair bit traction . 4x customer year ago time , 9x number vms . number company know using , like cerner . accenture pennymac & p global ( script ) state louisiana . customer appropriately said , '' well 's great . love use tool 've managed on-premises infrastructure manage aws . make easier move application cloud . application told guy keep on-premises ? '' much something thinking last year model try solve issue we've heard customer n't work . 's provided solution different apis , different tool , different control play different hardware . really hard customer use . 's surprising . 're taking 2 thing , 're different on-premises cloud try connect 2 thing together clunky bridge , end something 's clunky hard use . thought problem , took different approach , thought le building clunky bridge 2 different thing distributing aws on-premises . 's announced last year keynote building something called aws outpost . outpost rack aws server deliver on-premises data center . 's got aws compute storage database analytics . decide composition want 'll deliver plug set maintain patch . 's lot work . announced coming year ago . 've lot customer conversation thing really important build inside . 'm excited announce general availability today aws outpost . outpost come ec2 eb ec eks emr vpcs rds . 'll adding s3 first half 2020 bunch thing time . make run workload need live on-premises close something aws apis , aws control plane , aws hardware tool allow leverage learning seamlessly connect aws application public region . 's really easy get started . go console , set outpost , decide composition want computer storage database , deliver outpost door . 'll install . 'll handle maintenance . 's plugged power network , 'll able see new aws outpost aws management console able use provision resource outpost . excited available today . come 2 variant . 're somebody used want use aws apis control plane operate outpost alongside 're rest aws public region , 'll use aws native outpost . that's available today . 're somebody want still use vmware control plane , like 're using vmware cloud aws number customer , 'll use variant outpost 's vmware cloud aws outpost . available early part 2020. excited give today . solve issue certain workload need live on- premise data center ca n't move cloud . 's second barrier 're hearing number customer . 's particularly larger organization say , `` end user particular geography workload latency-sensitive need single-digit millisecond latency data center kind colo clunky gpus desk n't want manage anymore . ? '' 's interesting issue well . 're cloud provider like u 's expensive launch mega region like 200 300 city around world . lot coming . n't know 've really contemplated 200 300 . thought issue . thought actually provide solution ? take typical example , real example 're medium company l.a. , content creation video game , workload 're building need single-digit millisecond latency . take company new york switzerland financial service , close market data , need single-digit millisecond latency . thought , different type construct provide solves issue scale ? 'm excited announce brand-new type aws infrastructure deployment called local zone , new type infrastructure deployment place compute storage database service close large city , starting l.a. local zone available today invitation . local zone compute storage database available . kind went back root little bit solving problem . said , `` think history aws , built highly ﬂexible , low-level building block build lot top . '' think many service , aws service service built top thing like s3 ec2 . worrying thinking type problem local zone , realize outpost really useful low-level ﬂexible building block . 've taken outpost . 've done innovation variance . customer , could n't bring outpost on-premises data center area n't want on-premises data center . 've built local zone metro city building manage outpost compute storage database analytics single-digit millisecond latency end user metro city need latency get job done . first one available l.a. today . expect u moving forward . solve workload stay on-premises data center , solve workload certain geography end user need single-digit millisecond latency . n't want data center . han e. vestberg andrew r. jassy han e. vestbergthe third barrier 're increasingly hearing customer mobile connected device world connected stealth network , get type single-digit millisecond latency well . promise 5g , people become curious . 've started believe possible . like new technology , true cloud big data machine learning iot , 's becoming true quantum computing 's true 5g well , lot hype lot misunderstanding technology . want try figure collectively leverage 5g give type customer experience , first , really understand 5g leverage . ca n't think somebody better explain u 5g work close partner ceo verizon , han vestberg , please join u . andrew , great . thank . welcome , han , appreciate . let start question heck really 5g ? different ? much better 4g ? matter folk ? matter lot room matter lot . 5g different g ever seen . think 2g 4g , basically took 2g phone sm voice . today 4g phone great experience , 's verizon phone , stream . 2 different capability , speed throughput . 2. 5g , 's actually 8 capability . call 8 currency . 8 currency , 'll give example , understand big difference . speed going -- 4g phone today , 40 , 60 megabit per second 10 gigabit per second individual device . 5g phone room right , 1.2 1.8 gigabit already 5g . speed . throughput going terabyte per square kilometer . today , gigabyte per square kilometer . latency , super important service developing , we're going maybe 40 80 millisecond 10 millisecond latency network . combine . also many device connect . today , connect 100,000 device per square kilometer , 5g 's 1 million . 's much people . 's device . go currency . think important slice . give individual , application thing , transformative technology 's going transform consumer behavior . 's going transform business . 's going transform society . andrew r. jassy han e. vestberg andrew r. jassyyou need build certain way . need fiber basically load radio base station , need high-frequency spectrum . need sdn , software-defined network . need virtualize network . need lot real estate edge . verizon build 8 currency , everyone going . build right , say , want give customer . already , launched 5g home 2018 , fiber-rich home broadband . launched 5g mobility . april . 18 city , want 30 year-end . course , continuing lot new innovation . start . 8 currency matter everybody 's develop . 's new thing 're bringing 5g . 's pretty awesome . people wo n't tethered anymore wi-fi lower-performing lte network ? think , first , spectrum position millimeter wave , big frequency , get enormous throughput . get 10 gig . latency 10 millisecond . course , 's . secondly , connectivity speed 2 thing . thing 5g bring processing edge , virtualized network , bring . call mobile edge compute 5g . 's really . , innovation consumer , low latency , immersive experience , machine load heavy , happen edge right virtualized network 8 currency . yes . make sense . well could tell 5g pretty compelling . think -- thought mean aws customer , want type application last-mile connectivity actually something meaningful , application always need amount compute amount storage . 've done past they've reached aws go get compute storage . problem many hop along way , like go device cell tower city aggregation site regional aggregation site internet aws back . type application excited using 5g , thing like machine learning edge autonomous , industrial equipment smart car city augmented virtual reality . can't afford n't want round trip back forth . really want want aws embedded somehow 5g edge location . think , 're customer , want , ca n't walk telco say , `` edge ? '' , one telco serve entire world geographically , 'd go lot telco say , `` edge ? '' 'd manage work different telco manage kind abstraction . 'd still want api han e. vestbergtools apis control plane thing sort . hard problem people try solve . 18 month ago , han ' team team started working collaborated deeply . excited announce new aws service called aws wavelength allows build application deliver single- digit millisecond latency mobile connected device aws compute storage embedded edge 5g . 've done 've embedded aws storage compute , edge 5g network . 've started verizon collaboration partner really true innovator space . sensitive portion application want single-digit millisecond latency , way fewer hop actually get compute storage . go device aggregation , city aggregation site . right 5g city aggregation site aws . 's much better experience . n't worry . we're launching . first launch partner verizon . 'll also kddi sk telecom vodafone part time . n't worry figuring manage across different telco . 've built abstraction make easy . said , started verizon 's often leader innovator space . tends invest network . thank . thank . u , historic day . mean , said , first 5g home . first 5g mobility world . course , today talk bringing 5g mobile edge compute edge , call verizon 5g edge . collaboration engineer working together 18 month , virtualize network , way radio packet core . bring wavelength order create platform 'll -- actually start innovating 8 currency , low latency , massive throughput . think 's massive moment u verizon actually lead sort movement world lot transformation new platform . already preview chicago . already customer using technology . 's much buzzword . actually preview . nfl . bethesda , gaming company using low latency . time , able slice currency , together aws wavelength , move load , course , way higher level data center wavelength . 's beauty 's going game changer . think everyone extremely excited . verizon extremely excited collaborate best greatest cloud company world bring innovator . really want see today , go booth verizon booth , actually start experience 8 currency . year progress 2020 , 're going deploy much real estate andrew r. jassy han e. vestberg andrew r. jassy han e. vestberg andrew r. jassycomes edge compute together aws see bringing . innovate customer partner . 's great day . . case 's obvious , 're pretty excited giving think complete -- think pretty dramatically change customer going able get done . could n't chosen better collaboration partner . 's deep partnership . love working verizon team , han . thank much . thank . great . thank . thank , man . talked , 're making big transformation , sometimes happens company get stalled ca n't figure move every last workload . 's spent fair bit time trying solve . we'll continue work trying solve moving forward . 3 big barrier think 've able help knock . deal application stay on-premises data center want work seamlessly rest aws application ; deal end user geography need single-digit millisecond latency n't want data center , , work seamlessly rest aws application ; leverage incredible innovation 5g single-digit millisecond latency connected device latency-sensitive part application , 3 big barrier knocked today . 'm going close comment . think 's big change happening . think change 's happening move cloud titanic shift 've seen technology lifetime , sometimes hard think handle . think lot people tell love embrace change . would say experience 's necessarily true . think lot people get nervous change . n't know mean whether skill successful change . mean scope job thing spend lot time working supplier built relationship . , lot time , 's big change transformation like , first reaction dismiss . becomes hard dismiss people moving 's value , reaction oftentimes `` well better . le expensively . performantly . n't appear true , lot time reaction try slow roll , enough nod , look like 're actually paying attention . problem dip toe water long period time transformation radically change industry , find tail end big shift suddenly way behind . sometimes , 's pretty startling far behind become quickly . mean history business littered company adjust big technical transformation left dust . reality cloud offer , give lifetime chance totally reinvent customer experience , totally reinvent business build thing never possible . opportunity u unlike lifetime probably unlike moving forward . opportunity right right . take . we'll every step way help . hope great rest week : invent . thank .
