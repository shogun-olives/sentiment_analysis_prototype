're still hanging next event website , click blue button say 'join interactive experience ' activate feature . okay , let 's get . 're going cover three thing : one , entire workforce securely access legacy modern application without exposing network attack ; two , get better protection threat data loss right within browser ; three , gain visibility unsafe activity even user corporate network device . we're going beyondcorp enterprise . beyondcorp enterprise , bce , call , google cloud 's zero trust access solution . bce , use chrome access apps resource . background , google 's network protects proxy traﬃc enforcing access policy . policy use factor identity , device info , location third-party signal authorize access apps data need job . 's awesome , marco . let 's get good stuff . think . easy developer work remotely securely right ? know 's tough task . know making life easy developer also protecting code critical . 's new beyondcorp enterprise feature , client connector important . enables zero trust access legacy thick client application . yes . think lot people run today . let 's take look developer would use . set laptop cymbal group . way , 're fictional company . cymbal around since 1970s n't modernized application . sound familiar ? one main developer application still hosted private data center . , see quite bit . recently , cymbal developer n't way access application remotely without vpn . security team constant concern remote user could expose network even worse , source code attack hacker . , using beyondcorp enterprise 's client connector , access client-server apps without vpn . let show cymbal - tanisha rai - marco genovese - tanisha rai - marco genovesedevelopers would connect via ssh git repository . show , let say , n't blink might miss . 's simple . let 's go ahead swing developer machine . , simply open google chrome . google chrome actually loaded , see authenticated mykit application repository already . right-hand corner , simply click endpoint verification extension , click start connection . endpoint postured background secured connection made gitlab . , simply , 's turned green course , minimize browser . left hand side , 'm going go ahead open terminal application , thick client application . 'm going go ahead run git clone 's actually going pull code git local machine . application pulled locally onto endpoint . know probably seemed pretty straightforward . might noticed : first , client , 's browser probably already opened ; second , background , continuously validating identity device bunch factor identity proxy ; third , tcp proxy seamlessly securely forward traﬃc . fact developer around world remotely , simply securely without hassle vpn pretty awesome . beyondcorp enterprise , worker allowed access application 're permitted use . , prevent unwanted lateral movement across network . audience , want know , would use method remote access organization ? awesome . , let 's see workforce securely access modern web application , even non-corporate device . let 's look cymbal extended workforce , call center contractor . meet rhonda . 's one thousand remote contractor help cymbal's 24/7 support holiday shopping season . , security community , share chat past year onboarded new temporary worker ? send laptop make install software could secure ? look like would yes . contractor also tend vulnerable attack . last year , 44 % organization experienced breach 74 % breach result giving much privileged access third party . cymbal , keeping user corporate network decrease risk exposed attack like ransomware . 's using beyondcorp enterprise come cymbal . contractor employee - tanisha rai - marco genovese - tanisha rai - marco genovese - tanisha raiable byod , onboard quickly use device feel comfortable , bce layer protection keep secure . way , rhonda secure access device clear separation work personal activity . let show exactly see begin day . first navigates google chrome browser . navigates cymbal call center application , enter credential . two-factor authentication time security key . passed two-factor authentication , cymbal call center application . saw rhonda log chrome cymbal credential . call beyondcorp protected profile . extends threat data protection soon log . see , agentless approach mean additional software . get right work device rather picking laptop waiting hour everything get configured , therefore saving time money . awesome , tanisha . thing zero trust access automatically trust rhonda , login credential . authorization continuous , first log . beyondcorp enterprise enforces cymbal's contractor access policy , based identity contextual information device location , well fact 's authenticated titan key . , security community , want know , use multi-factor authentication , sm code , security key , maybe authentication app maybe something else completely ? hopefully , 's nothing . , 's security key , every day , especially since n't always phone . yes , . 're easy use provide strongest protection phishing . regardless use , form multi-factor authentication critical basic security hygiene highly recommend , especially remote access . let 's take look . n't know anybody anything . look like , people use , let 's say , security key , b , awesome . that's love hear . , let 's get back rhonda authenticated app explore integrate threat data protection right within browser . great . let 's see get work show bce protect cymbal , customer rhonda ease . 's really busy day . n't enough time finish processing batch customer refund next call . want save - marco genovese - tanisha rai - marco genovesethe customer credit card information local file refund thing slow . saving sensitive information another location cymbal security policy . let show experience . let 's navigate credit card file let 's download rhonda refund another time . see , 's blocked . see message appear bottom prevents . yes , exactly . actually see credit card pdf sensitive dangerous content inside . 'll show policy 's configured cymbal detect risky behavior like . let 's go ahead look administrative console admin.google.com . left hand side , see security menu . scroll underneath security , actually see data protection . 're going go ahead authenticate obviously administrator securely . let 's go type password . 've authenticated , 'll able go ahead look data protection policy . 'll notice , say managed rule . we're going go ahead drill managed rule actually see credit card detection policy ron hitting right . 've also got detector thing like social security even detecting code 's copied pasted shared developer . admin , decide want automatically block user action , cymbal done want trigger warning user instead . addition thing like credit card number , also set specific dlp policy detect file type source code . way protect sensitive information code monitoring , controlling even blocking people upload download . exactly . use granular policy type information order protect exfiltration . , showed type data protection policy set . also customize access policy change take effect real time . really big deal get continuous checking whether user policy , giving second security control . fact , let 's make update real time rhonda . okay , community , 're going ask policy change . location , maybe operating system policy ? whether 's corporate owned device ? please chime , 'd really love understand hear guy deem important . wait result come , say see kind thing time customer . want able dynamically change policy depending circumstance . particular , customer really - tanisha rai - marco genoveseinterested controlling location , perhaps limiting access certain country . additionally , company going org change maybe merger , able change access policy select group user department real time crucial . beyond three choice poll , many way customize access policy based organization need . , let 's go ahead look back poll . look like corporate owned device . awesome . love . thanks everybody contributing . let 's go ahead right . 're going go ahead jump gcp cloud console . , see identity-aware proxy . actually see cymbal gitlab developer application . also see call center application . , application could anywhere demo , 're gcp . 're going go ahead select call center application bottom , see rhonda right hand side application access policy . let 's go ahead edit , 're going go ahead remove existing access policy 's allowing access europe u.s. , we're going go ahead delete one . 're going add new rule . 're simply going go ahead select cloud iap , iap web app user . , 're going go ahead select access policy everybody chose , required corporate device , right ? okay . want make sure remember correctly . let 's go ahead save place . click save save policy , 's actually going propagated across world within short period time . proxy across google 's global network immediately updated . next time user try access protected resource , 're evaluated new policy set . mentioned continuous authorization earlier key part . authorization one-time occurrence . even begin new session , n't mean 'll perpetual access . exactly . company like cymbal employ hourly temp worker , ability dynamically update access condition important . instance , could set policy worker access application resource shift hour working day allow access specific geography . also may want require device up-to-date operating system security patch . important condition manage , especially contractor using device . exactly . rhonda n't meet condition , updated , longer able access call center application . , think 've faced 's one frustrating thing remote access , especially 're using vpn . think access something , reason , 's working . - tanisha rai - marco genovese - tanisha rai - marco genoveseit 's worse . let 's see real-time change worked . rhonda try open new task call center application , let 's take look see . let's navigate back home . 's denied access , result change marco . , bce rhonda covered . report error using new feature beyondcorp enterprise policy troubleshooter , informs end user 're blocked tell get help quickly . , see , would follow prompt email admin get help . let's go ahead email admin . admin notified u blocked . beyondcorp enterprise policy troubleshooter , admins quickly fix issue blocking user keeping productive . yes . bet . let show cymbal admin would see side request unblock user like rhonda . 're going go ahead switch gear . let 's go gmail , another google application . look like got notification credit card detection , good . know ron taking interesting action within endpoint , oh , look like got email rhonda 's actually blocked application . 's link sent , let 's go ahead click , 'll automatically logged directly google cloud platform . , actually see different policy binding place . let 's go ahead select call center application . right hand side , actually see granted condition denial . let 's go ahead look binding detail . interestingly , see rhonda failed meet listed access level sure enough , 's requiring corporate device granted . normally go back block updating policy . access level evaluated like contractor , 're going keep moving interest time . sound good . easy way . yes , super easy . , let 's look bce give u better visibility unsafe user activity , whether unsuccessful access attempt like saw anomalous activity across apps bce protects . let put security dashboard chrome give look . , 're going jump back google admin console security menu left hand side , actually click dashboard . wait load second . something make note chrome data protection , 're actually going get whole slew different information . see chrome high-risk user , see individual dlp incident want scroll little bit . could actually see many user forgetting password , figure use track pad . see user login attempt , see example message encrypted , we're - tanisha rai - marco genovese - tanisha rai - marco genovese - tanisha rai - iman ghanizada - sri subramanianinterested whether credit card number making . , let 's go ahead drill little bit one report . see every single file uploaded , file downloaded , web content upload example . actually see every single time took place social security detection well credit card detection . actually drill credit card detection think 's really cool , 'm going show everybody real quick since like another minute sensitive data transfer taking place , block detected otherwise . even organization n't using corporate-owned device , still monitor security event investigate alert . 's awesome , marco . audience , think ? let u know chat . definitely know something interest . last 15 minute , 've seen entire workforce access modern legacy application securely , improve threat data protection get better visibility risky activity , even unmanaged device . yes . call right end day beyondcorp enterprise make experience productive secure team look forward supporting zero trust journey . thanks much joining u today participating . live q & coming next answer google cloud security question , well question might demo . please stick around . yes , please . thank joining . see soon . bye . awesome . thanks much , tanisha marco . 's incredible demo . 's always fun see product action , 'm sure great spotlight earlier , demo , audience great question lined . thank joining everyone today . name iman . sri . 'm thrilled , answering question live fabulous studio sunnyvale . - iman ghanizada - sri subramanian - iman ghanizada - sri subramanian - iman ghanizada - sri subramanian - iman ghanizada - sri subramanian - iman ghanizadaawesome . 're also joined team took live demo minute ago . may see pop help answer question throughout show . okay . let 's jump right little poll . tell u got excited today ? trusted cloud ? zero trust philosophy ? $ 10 billion cybersecurity investment ? cybersecurity action team ? way , 'm waiting poll result . wait result , reminder , q & live , engage u directly . steve , brian , dinesh , 'm watching right live chat . , , go back next event website click blue 'join interactive experience ' button . give time submit poll , want hear scoop , sri . , tell u 're excited ? really excited zero trust model . feel like , 're kind adopting 're seeing lot people move toward . -- yeah . yes . mean , 've long , right ? 're taking approach 've pioneered 're putting world watching lot customer sort adopting approach . yes , absolutely . awesome . look like -- look like , . look like . yes , 's right . 's right . look like lot people really excited zero trust , 's amazing . okay , cool . 's next runner ? 've got $ 10 billion cybersecurity investment , zero trust definitely leading pretty big margin . right , let 's go ahead get started . let 's kick first question , yes . right , sound good . - sri subramanian - iman ghanizada - sri subramanianall right , cool . guess 're waiting question audience populate , question , security dominating headline ? rock like notice stuff 's happening around u , ipo sentinelone forgerock darktrace . 're seeing president prime minister commit large amount , giant amount dollar including new president security . , think two thing . typically , industry see lot movement technology shift happens 're seeing digital transformation , way secure environment changed , 's lot movement that's happening industry . added , security thing 's also driven people attacking -- attack happening 're seeing huge amount attack happening today . result , like example , 've -- mean , really sad , 've first death happened ransomware year . 've pipeline company pay ton money ransomware . -- 've manufacturing company get disrupted manufacturing distillery company , basically disruption pretty recently . , 're seeing lot happen around u 's kind adding focus area , people starting realize important area need lot investment , otherwise business going suffer nation going suffer . 's think part reason 're seeing doubling exponential growth . mentioned couple great thing . like , 've noticed cloud evolution allowed lot business sort transform way work , way offer service product consumer , human being dependent technology ever . , like say like , cybersecurity going start seen service-oriented role , honorable role society customer build healthcare system cloud , industrial system cloud , offer sort service , right ? become dependent technology , need ensure we're also advancing state secure infrastructure , protect customer protect people end day . , look like got question jeanette [ ph ] , make google's cloud secure trusted competitor ? , google actually started building lot security product , right ? google known secure company 've done recently taken work done secure corporation customer like beyondcorp saw demo recaptcha productized , vision every customer secure google . add idea innovation 's google . example , - iman ghanizada - sri subramanian - iman ghanizada - marco genovesewhen decided go federal space fedramp certification , instead standing couple data center near north virginia saying like , let 's , let 's -- set customer , let 's give cloud compliant need , decided make google cloud fedramp pie . , customer brazil leverage feature much federal customer might . think leaning forefront security 're seeing trusted partner cloud , example , couple announcement last week , announcement thales . 're sort saying -- lot nation want able infrastructure destiny . , 're taking google cloud kind making available way operate . , 's another thing we're 's kind pushing boundary , think idea pushing boundary , make google really special . yes , think mentioned something 's really important like , infrastructure 've served billion user around world gmail , search , 's kind no-brainer also allow enterprise small business also revamp way operation cloud infrastructure . , able global change like fedramp certification , right , manage infrastructure end end , big , big element . allows u govern cloud securely , eﬃciently also pioneer really significant change cloud customer worldwide . 100 % . yes . right . got next question , izumi [ ph ] . question , operating system bce support ? bce support third-party cloud on-premise application ? believe question would probably best suited marco . yes . answer question . beauty beyondcorp would say based obviously breadth width chrome browser support operating system point . whether 's chrome o , obviously , love hold near dear heart window mac o linux android io , support . user n't going limited particular operating system great , especially organization trying enable , right , enable employee contractor . top , support everything thick client application , right , server-based application , web-based application , could htp , tcp-based protocol . limit point time . kind imagination limit . - iman ghanizada - sri subramanian - iman ghanizadayes . mean someone probably n't get much exposure beyondcorp getting hand used , really loved demo . , super helpful 'm -- ca n't wait go back re-watch . 've got another question tara [ ph ] , spotlight . sunil spoke lot invisible security . two question , two-pronged . security invisible , mean ca n't change setting decide security want ? two , invisible security mean security free ? 's great question . think 'd like step back see problem , right ? problem 're trying solve alert fatigue 're trying deal , right ? -- corporation ca n't even look , forget processing , 50 % alert get . 're starting see alert coming , n't look . lot work done bubble important alert put front sock forth . still mean 're 50 % alert n't even look , right ? idea , thing prevent certain type action , example , might kosher action without creating friction business ? based businesses-owned rule , org policy write ? deny policy write ? build platform way 're bringing number alert number thing need watch ? actually guide thing happen ? , idea moving always responding thing maybe preventing thing , maybe guiding people right direction . great example , customer told sometimes popping question like , something want , 'll find large number people , right ? , -- lot different way prevent certain thing happening think core invisible security . based thing someone might configure . 's based business logic , company want 's something 's invisible sense lose visibility security , 's invisible . thing n't need 're coming time . ( multiple speaker ) much possible , 's like security person ever said job completely stress-free 's usually right . , like say like , human , security everyday life , right , threat model leave house , put seatbelt , lock door . 've taught year evolution secure , right ? u others , right ? get digital life cloud , relearn thing build infrastructure become part background process come user enablement come amazing product - tanisha rai - iman ghanizada - marco genovese - iman ghanizada - sri subramanianwe serve . security core advance amazing thing we're human new world everything technology-driven whatnot . got question noor [ ph ] , one 's tanisha probably . would say , tanisha , application bce support ? thanks , iman . bce support application iaa saas thick client application well . like mentioned , support http http addition tcp protocol , like ssh rdp . awesome . see lot great chatter audience . ravi , joey , tisha , tommy . awesome . thank engaging . right , cool . got another question john mikhail [ ph ] , sorry pronounced name wrong . say , use chrome browser bce ? , make sure chrome browser use approved one ? chrome browser 's use approved one , another chrome instance could amend middle . yes . make sense . kind beauty context-aware policy , right ? enforce policy browser level , version , example , kind browser 're able access . 's corporate managed browser device , wrap policy around . , granular . would say side want user able use browser want , right , personal access . think 's great . continue support 's want , 's corporation want . far accessing corporate resource , 's like anything else , right ? want able manage 're going actually trust anything . trust chrome browser accessing corporate application work great customer , 's best method kind move forward . hopefully answer question . thanks , marco . yes . right . got question robert . say , google 's zero trust model different competing hyperscalers ? , think zero trust model like -- google set zero trust model think 's world 's adopting zero trust model . zero trust model , there's one model . n't google zero trust model someone else 's zero trust model . zero trust model similar -- maybe think analogy thing happen today , got studio . 've vaccinated tested multiple time last week still came , got tested . - iman ghanizada - sri subramanian - iman ghanizada - sri subramanian - iman ghanizadaand , masked shield front camera , soon done , 're going masked sent , right ? idea access something time access 's context whether need access 're coming 're added decision-making . think 's zero trust , great pioneered google . today model 's used everywhere . think question may coming beyondcorp enterprise differentiated ? think key thing 've seen track record google term keeping employee data safe beyondcorp enterprise , 're trying get customer . one thing would like point zero trust model n't one tool . 's mindset , 's way thing 'm really excited gcat , announcement made cybersecurity action team we're going like security expert cisos , people like phil venables , available customer think model think end-to- end , 're going actually implementing . 's exciting thing think overall . pioneering product . knowledge zero trust end-to-end . 've actually implemented 've proven . love analogy put together covid whatnot , 's like went traditional network-centric boundary identity-centric boundary 's like , 's purpose factor performing action . think one amazing thing first joined google use vpn . yes . think worked thought really nice . 're going go question amitabh [ ph ] ford . question , implement zero trust org ? great question . 'm going actually throw question . solution team , let 's talk , right ? implement zero trust org ? guess start beyondcorp . factor think ? always like say lot big workload transformation security matter buying product paying service . take lot enablement - sri subramanian - iman ghanizada - sri subramanian - iman ghanizadaand education top bottom . structurally think 're going transform way work implication way work today pro con approach going , strategy going sort get . strategy going augmented people , team , development team , tool , partner . advise customer sit client talk solution , right , helping transform element business , n't talk product leveraged organization , 've got product team talk product . talk actually transform business , get whole organization culturally transform way work , get tangible path achieving zero trust architecture workforce , may multi-year strategy , right ? , 's many , many , many different layer . agree . think 's whole thing think question -- think product particular problem 're trying solve , 're thinking end-to-end , like security strong weakest link , right ? , contractor direct access , problem . thinking thing end-to-end ? awesome . way , big shout-out gcat bringing security advisory role . got one last question sri , 'm going give last question , , mean shared fate ? different shared responsibility ? 's great question . shared responsibility really unfortunately come mean giving responsibility . responsible something 're responsible something else . , partnership approach google want . want able say , well , 're sharing responsibility we're sharing fate responsibility . 're two thing ; one we're making sure 're bringing data left term configuration might , term like secure landing zone secure blueprint . also risk manager quantify able address risk . shared fate 're actually part process customer . awesome . thank joining u today big thanks sri , tanisha marco sharing insight .
