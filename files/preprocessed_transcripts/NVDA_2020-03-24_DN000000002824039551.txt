'm last question , may -- may require little bit longer answer . 'd love hear happens dust settle relative current situation . current phenomenon social distancing last number month come wave , impact behind u , would expect anything nvidia 's business , market position , supply chain aspect business change , let 's say , structural way ? sure . think overall growth opportunity , 's kind - - think 's good reminder help people understand gaming graphic business definitely driving . number gamers globally continues grow esports continues gain popularity audience hundred million . max-q technology important piece unlocking overall notebook market also term workstation market , new type gaming device opportunity enterprise graphic keeping thin light , well inï¬‚uencing mobility necessary . studio line new entrant allows u address 40 million creatives freelancer could benefit nvidia gpu . cloud gaming clearly development hold great long-term opportunity u expand reach 200 million gamers address whole opportunity probably 1 billion gamers . data center business also continue grow . outlined late last year term $ 50 billion tam 've identified front u . training continue benefit see exponential increase ai model complexity continue fuel overall training market . overall entrant continue benefit increased performance requirement overall shrinking latency budget . set quite well overall inferencing product , given overall software enhancement overall programming address larger larger opportunity inferencing . edge ai , think large business continue ramp extend reach data center edge across industry . importantly , ai probably technology force time nvidia uniquely positioned power good portion ai 's . well , colette , thanks much time today . 's . guess , i'll turn back simona . q - vivek arya - jeffrey d. fisherokay . thank much , . think 'll turn right back vivek gaming part call . okay . great . thanks , , thanks colette , jeff simona opportunity . good note nvidia community broadly okay . maybe let 's get gaming , fun market , time , maybe extra important trying time . jeff , let 's start question , think , 's top mind investor colette touched high level . seeing perspective positive negative demand side , ongoing covid-19 headline ? difference geographic perspective , sense channel inventory sell-through trend asp trend , give u snapshot -- change positive negative 've noticed last week inform u gaming business least near-term ? yeah . thanks , vivek , thanks hosting . 's certainly interesting year say least gaming , 's still playing know , fundamental encouraging . work home global . think 're probably sitting home right call . graphic , 've seen important enabling technology folk working remotely . first , gaming , mean , 've read could imagine , hour gameplay increasing . 've seen installed base increase probably 50 % gaming hour . also evident steam 've broken new concurrent gaming record 20 million gamers , playing time steam platform . saw first china , coming chinese new year early feb , 're starting see west last one week two week , term viewer well , twitch also , may read averaged -- 've doubled average viewership year-over-year last several week . 's interesting even pro sport also hiatus moving esports . formula one , nascar , indycar driver organizing race viewer tune watch . 70,000 viewer nascar-e -- online e-nascar race week . overall 're seeing pretty good demand trend gaming . obviously thing little ï¬‚uid 'll talk little bit bit . student , hundred million student studying home . oems seeing lift laptop demand across performance price range , result student need take work home either video conferencing advanced engineering math work . 's data scientist , pro , designer data science creator , pro working home . 20 million enterprise-based quadro workstation , n't gaming space , wanted comment . worker need performance laptop need remote data center virtual quadro workstation . 're also seeing -- trend around higher performance workstation-based laptop sold type worker . q - vivek arya - jeffrey d. fisheryou also mentioned supply chain , 'll talk little bit . supply chain getting back work . think , colette , mentioned discussion asc partner desktop side , primarily 70 % 80 % back work . say 70 % 80 % capacity back place . aic 's oems working catch inventory -- channel inventory drawn result cny plus covid extended shut . part desktop side channel inventory replenished . 're approaching healthy number . laptop side , 's supply chain little complex , take little longer may take little longer come back . noted , 'm sure 've read demand strong laptop due work home scenario . believe inventory likely remain normal amount time . n't know want keep -- want ask question keep adding color ? yeah . maybe kind nail specific impact , connect dot gameplay ability ship gpus demand actually gpu shipment part , could also give u sense trend might noticed asp perspective people maybe gaming home otherwise , preferring certain kind gpus asp mix perspective would noticed otherwise ? like specific demand side impact nvidia ? yeah . think let 's talk regional first , think , colette , mentioned icafes represent , think , guy know reasonable amount demand china . throughout covid , icafes shut . demand -- weaker beginning quarter . think 's part observed beginning quarter icafes starting reopen . 's still early . would say 10 % , 20 % icafe traï¬ƒc starting return take time , 're starting reopen time normalizing . 've seen demand shift retail e-tail . 's -- market eï¬ƒcient , mean , proud channel , 's resilient find way get product market . china , -- retail shut , e-tail really stepped pick demand 're starting see region west well . talked asp trend . 's probably early tell . mean , 've seen demand continues intact stack . , guess , would n't expect much shift demand result covid . 'll get -- 'll continue watch . definitely correlation gaming hour amount time people playing game -- important win compete , demand gaming product . 's -- 's -- 've seen demand definitely intact throughout environment , hard really put exact number correlation . q - vivek arya - jeffrey d. fisher got . maybe , jeff , going technology aspect business , give u sense adoption ray tracing technology among customer base . think , guy launched specific technology , least outside , perhaps , seen little bit ahead time . current status adoption ? think game publisher need extra incentive adopt ? part , think , yesterday also launched dl 2.0 , maybe explain investor benefit adopt maybe faster , maybe drive maybe faster adoption ray tracing among game publisher importantly gamers ? okay . yeah . good question . mean , turing great . 50 % -- sorry , 15 % installed base upgraded turing . high level ramp continues outpace prior-gen pascal . remember pascal stack launched time , effectively 1.99 pascal in-market within several month . turing stack staggered . 2060 , 3.99 really shipping six month higher end stack . look ramp turing relative pascal , way try explain normalizing t0 product ramped regard turing ramp outpacing pascal 're super excited end market . core feature turing brought market , mean , turing announced really delivering reinvention graphic , ray tracing , ai , number feature talk minute come play microsoft 's new update direct x. asked ray tracing particular start ray tracing around year . 's movie industry computer graphic used deliver cinematic scene . however , 's required frame rendered oï¬ „ ine get type realism cg type frame . rtx changed overnight delivering ability render frame real-time , ray traced range real-time . talked adoption , game take year develop . many developer want lead visual realism , want first one , proud gamers expect really movie cinematics game come market . early adopter really first game embraced ray tracing come market game amazing . i'll mention minute . top , installed base hardware-accelerated ray tracing explode , know want talk console bit . sony microsoft announced revealed hardware ray tracing capability console , footprint continues expand , bring entire industry forward 's going bring excitement among developer gamers alike bring type effect ray -- real-time ray tracing going enable . think kind perfect moment really usher new wave ray-traced content . looking game , 've number game come market already real-time ray tracing , unbelievably amazing . metro recently shipped earlier year . control one recent game really took advantage , took ray tracing new level , deliver u moon , indie title stunning . looking forward , 've talked , 've working microsoft mojang bring ray tracing minecraft . look what's possible realistic effect ray tracing brings minecraft , 's mind- boggling . minecraft probably important game world , 100 billion view youtube . 's 100 million monthly gamers playing minecraft . 'll see later year minecraft come market creator moderator able game exploring world minecraft going pretty amazing . think add cyberpunk 2077 think year going great year technology . asked dl 2.0. let talk , one core feature turing rtx technology call tensor core , brings ai graphic . dl take advantage tensor core bring ai gaming first time . dl effectively ai image reconstruction technology , 's real- time -- real-time , fill missing bit every frame , allows -- delivers effectively doubling performance , could think rtx 2060 , 299 349 gpu performing game dl roughly performance 2080 tie , 999 gpu . dl effectively double performance entire stack game -- game integrate capability . dl 2.0 , dl announced turing architecture back -- gamescom 2018 continued evolve game added . dl 2.0 , 's next-generation technology brings new level performance new level realism . artifact could imagine come along ai , reconstruction -- resolved dl 2.0. fact , image delivered 2.0 often seen better original game frame . dl 2.0 also capability , train network , neural network non- specific content . let describe moment , original , dl first launched , train neural net , gaming -- imagery construction based every game . game dl trained frame game time consuming , took great deal tuning per title . dl 2.0 train non-games-specific . use generalized image train network . result much better , integration game much faster . part expectation dl become prevalent q - vivek arya - jeffrey d. fisher q - vivek arya - jeffrey d. fisher q - vivek aryamore game easier integrate . unreal engine 4 integrates -- well , next release unreal engine 4 integrate dl . available game developer using ue 4 fairly simple integration 'll work developer make sure 's tuned game . -- go ahead . yeah . maybe quick follow-up , one question come , think , investor understand game , production quality go , that's incentive people upgrade gaming card . esports ? , perception maybe quality requirement high , esports take , impact gaming business , change , whether asp 's unit metric ? esports becomes dominant growth driver ? 're excited growth driver . mean , aaa game cinematic realism definitely drive higher-end gpus developer really love take advantage capability rtx deliver next-generation visuals realism . mentioned , esports , 're also super excited , know 've seen campaign , science behind fact frame win game . lower latency , higher frame rate , accuracy 're going competitive gamer . look number installed base user gamers -- ca n't deliver 144 frame per second higher , 's large number . believe installed base -- esports grows installed base , 's going want upgrade get low latency high frame rate , excel competitive esports . factor , aaa esports , national business going forward . got . brought game console look like still track second half . one perception kind pause game console come gamers , perhaps , want see important feature maybe game launch alongside . aspect , historically , remember often stimulated demand pc gaming market well . looking impact business game console launched ? part , could also , perhaps , help u understand impact , , mix card , look performance attribute game console , - jeffrey d. fisher q - vivek arya - jeffrey d. fishersignificantly higher prior generation . impact overall game console launch back half business ? yeah . think , mentioned , mean , historically , new console cycle good pc gaming . basically rise tide . give higher benchmark developer target next wave game going require higher end hardware . 've seen installs pc gaming , pc gamers buying ahead console past , would n't expect time around either . think , fundamentally , gamer -- pc gamers buy stick pc scalability visual , 're able play pc . n't expect change time . 's exciting cycle console bringing new technology market . ray tracing probably important one . 's something 've shipping last two year . 've got -- 've established bit installed base around . think u couple year ahead industry respect . opportunity console combined rtx really continue accelerate reinvention graphic super exciting u . let comment performance . see performance , 've read thing 's coming console guy . think end day -- today 's game , console going land somewhere middle higher end stack . also think add fact ray tracing capability couple year ahead console , ai graphic , 've started deliver content . think 'll see stack similar differentiation console 've seen prior cycle , course , 're standing still , 're working next-gen hardware well . see headline medium particular console center teraï¬‚op slow teraï¬‚ops , imply , jeff , term comparable graphic card delivers level performance n't apple apple kind comparison ? yeah . think 's comparing teraï¬‚ops apple apple . mean even look architecture relative competitor game performance game performance teraï¬‚ops teraï¬‚ops , think , 's -- 'll see -- wo n't see direct correlation number . real question ultimate game play performance . mentioned , see game moving rt game using dl . think 're going see real disconnect number . mentioned , 2060 dl performs around 2080 tie performance 's -- could real discontinuity well . q - vivek arya - jeffrey d. fisher q - vivek arya - jeffrey d. fisher q - vivek aryaso think 've got see play , general assessment performance console -- range console coming still n't know exactly different model would , somewhere -- range middle stack higher end stack -- current stack . maybe let ask one last way , , look deployed base gamers look performance attribute gameplay attribute new console , proportion deployed base gamers today access level gameplay performance ? well , look ray tracing , mentioned , rtx 15 % installed base . , maybe 'll start . 'm -- question , kind lift refresh might see impact new console , performance new console . think , -- majority installed base would want upgrade new -- new level performance game coming next year require . got . perfect . maybe one level technology detail . important manufacturing node term maintaining competitive edge main competitor adopted 7-nanometer node ahead . taken nvidia longer adopt whenever adopted , could potential benefit important manufacturing node come maintaining market share dominance market ? yeah . 's good question . mean , race first node large ship , benefit really kind waned moore 's law slowed architecture becomes really important thing . 've competing 7-nanometer product almost year 12-nanometer solution . continue best price-performance . continue best power eï¬ƒciency , might think illogical look specifically node , 's really design architecture execution becomes super important 's area excel . ultimately move smaller technology , think , see benefit architecture scale even . 're really looking forward . n't think 's race first node anymore . 's really best architecture , best feature best execution . got . maybe one last one , jeff , turn back colette closing comment . maybe impact game streaming business . think , colette , touched , could perhaps give u color -- geforce kind becoming important business , , let 's say , 5g take , - jeffrey d. fisher q - vivek arya - jeffrey d. fisher q - vivek arya - jeffrey d. fisherright , provide another driver game streaming overall additive business ? comment game streaming ? yeah . thanks . geforce , think , 're referring really exciting .
