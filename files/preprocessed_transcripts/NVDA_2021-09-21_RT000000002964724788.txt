've got roughly 35 minute hear ali , 's going present brieﬂy , 'll move q & . question audience , please feel free e-mail , try put . , thank , ali , great , i'll turn . thank much . 's pleasure today . jump . going forward-looking statement . okay . wanted start talking automotive strategy nvidia . think really differentiate , 're focused building platform 's open modular , partner work u level stack . , customer buy computer car built full autonomous driving stack , training , simulation , build av application , cockpit application , 's great partnership u . case customer also ask u build autonomous driving application , training simulation . design stack modular way actually pick choose want nvidia . fact sort build stack end-to-end , make product better across stack . note also customer n't use computer car , work u cloud training simulation . , open modular platform happens end-to-end really fundamental strategy big reason success nvidia 's automotive business . next slide . one thing make self-driving development easier partner try build platform make easy people build application . even though 're building autonomous driving application cockpit application , many customer actually customer build . try build platform really attractive partner . computer architecture sensor set create actually designed functional , safe secure . provide infrastructure tool oem build av application cockpit application . fact built platform sort open , modular way , design upgradeable across generation . make much easier partner develop platform , customer , example , using xavier platform . since platform designed upgradeable , 's easy take -- 'm sorry , point computer upgraded xavier computer , design platform software compatible . application build xavier run orin get . designing platform way save customer much time wasted investment , right ? 's big part strategy , make easy people want build av development . reason 're building platform recognize issue . try enable thing help u develop faster partner ecosystem . okay . talk making platform upgradable , way think similar tesla build car , could buy tesla hardware 2 , upgrade hardware 2.5 upgrade hardware 3. part 're building equivalent sort tdp computer form factor tdp compatible computer plug vehicle . keep giving upgrade oem . take xavier computer , upgrade orin computer , upgraded atlan computer . pace innovation nvidia offer oems really significant . 's software compatible , investment make u , xavier platform pulled orin platform . ecosystem platform growing , develop platform 's lot advantage stay , roadmap keep getting better , make platform easy go one generation next . okay . move application software , 's lot work oems . one area 're differentiated , full self- driving application 's available partner . oem right want invest electrification base vehicle o , partner u parking application , self-driving application , end cap application . , oems want help . capability , one give u opportunity help oems way standard component supplier . also -- learning developing application feed next generation chip . chip actually better next generation , 're delivering application realize , well , put chip , even better someone building self-driving computer next time . product actually increasingly sort differentiated people actually building self-driving car . talk end-to-end ﬂow training simulation . real differentiator anyone building av mind , speed development ﬂow . reason say building ml ops development ﬂow safe secure never done industry . n't like building software cluster 's android tablet io tablet , something wrong , 's okay , later software update get better time . building self-driving computer , make sure 's safe secure . want able test software simulation roll car . want able test software shadow mode inside car update car make sure 're causing negative experience driver . , need software development ﬂow bunch interconnected ai leak happening time . way build map ai loop , take data road , need train network data , need build map need ota car . take mapping network , also feed mapping network perception network car , map actually good way train path reception network . loop interconnected , everything 're also get tested single loop well self-driving loop , making self-driving loop essentially identical digital twin simulator lot work . build software development ﬂow piece interconnected safe secure actually designed could quickly find issue , root cause , fix . ota car , speed core value proposition anyone building autonomous driving software . 's 're investing company , end-to-end ﬂow . dgx system sell help people training . constellation system help people simulation , av software . thing intertwine together form software development ﬂow 's eﬃcient . 's 're focused innovating differentiating , really believe actually core source advantage one av company versus another . , think wanted point nvidia ecosystem going significant growth . 's traditional oem 's , like mercedes , volvo , hyundai ; 's whole slew nevs [ ph ] building car way would want build , could reimagine future car would . -- company developing nvidia platform , whether neo , auto , x pang , farady future . company also q - c.j . muse - ali kanibuilding robotaxis , autonomous truck , vast majority also developing platform . think ecosystem also source advantage . reason , people develop platform , learn . tell u , hey , 's something could next time . make software better way ? could make hardware better way ? take learning 's incorporate roadmap . i'm particularly proud fact 's hundred company developing av 's oem strategy , 's platform strategy . slide show guy oem partner develop platform . actually work camera vendor radar lidar mapping partner tier 2 , tier 3 , oems , isvs startup building software hardware vendor ecosystem , 're also bringing product developer platform . think 's great , 's -- 're trying service oems.anyone 's building application product connects computer , want work make application run best platform sensor work best platform . think 's core part advantage . always talk guy , wanted give guy background think really help u differentiate . think we've mentioned , pipeline growing 's across board . 's passenger vehicle , robotaxis , truck . 's term hardware , right , 's customer increasingly want work u software . put option together , pipeline growing significantly , $ 8 billion pipeline . question answer ( question answer ) great . ali , thank presentation . guess start , 'd love kind level set nvidia 's automotive business today , $ 500 million plus fiscal '21 , kind see future , particularly look pipeline $ 8 billion extending fiscal '27 . , way kind level set kind legacy infotainment , smart cockpit , l2 plus autopilot ? kind see ramping coming year ? yeah , mean , mentioned legacy infotainment le third business continue dwindle away , combined smart cockpit together legacy infotainment , smart cockpit little half business today . think 'll find mix av self-driving ramp grow time , we'll start see inﬂection later next year really try scale calendar year '23 '24 . q - c.j . muse - ali kani q - c.j . muse - ali kaniand term inﬂection second half '22 , 's principally driving confidence ? 's really win 've announced . good number navs announced product go production 2022. lot china navs talked , well emerging ramp couple oems , volvo , we've announced going going production 2022 , saic . vehicle start ramp , business going start see inﬂection later next year , 'll really start hit ramp '23 '24 . helpful . guess take step back , trying get arm around , hardware compute side thing . heart nvidia compute , although clearly software becoming bigger bigger part company , would love hear benefit orin coming production '22 . guess perhaps importantly , drive atlan scheduled come online 2024 , roadmap able support ? , mean , think , first let say , think orin home run . mean , think amount traction success 've orin far larger xavier , 're really excited product . think 's industry started truly appreciate something 've preaching long time really build software-defined computer car . 's easier oems update support upgrade experience time . think term software service business , 's transformative , transforms business model oems . supply shortage chip industry , oems also realized 's better strategy supply management . 's many fundamental area software-defined computer like orin unlocks oems , mean , think 's 's driving success . talk atlan , put strategy together , let 's make sure platform compatible . let 's build atlan computer 's one factor power compatible orin let 's build software stack apis people develop compatible one generation next . see exciting u atlan let customer upgrade vehicle throw away software . find , faster generation advancement oems , whereas build one architecture , keep six eight year , n't want change architecture . product architecture compatible , really unlock new feature functionality , 's form factor architecture compatible upgrade available atlan . q - c.j . muse - ali kanihelpful . guess maybe expand , iaa mobility . focused speed development ﬂow key differentiator av market . spoke today . hoping maybe could dig little bit deeper meaning ? strictly hardware side , software side ? play role customer choosing kind tier 1 , tier 2 tier 3 supplier ? would love hear , guess , thought around speed vital emerging market . okay . let sort explain 'm talking . 'm talking speed av development ﬂow . mean , let 's take tesla example . 've reading accident tesla 's . go analyze accident , 's 10 , almost every one emergency vehicle siren . 's parked emergency vehicle , right , every one parked emergency vehicle , could ambulance , could police car . every single case , 's parked emergency vehicle car hit . first accident 2.5 year ago recent one couple month ago . -- existing proof company building av code , autonomous driving code upgrade update experience life car safe secure way . tesla , tesla otas , right ? 'm saying , 's accident last 2.5 year , accident , 's still fixed car . speed developed ﬂow talk build self-driving software stack find issue actually root cause , truly root cause , many thing self-driving vehicle stack . problem caused accident ? go solve problem ? sometimes need go get new data , train new network data , test , put car , test shadow mode , ota car . long take go loop ? capability expertise hard one done ai code safety security also critical . 'm saying , look challenge tesla 's . even though give u otas , -- give u otas , car actually drive better . n't solve problem , 's actually bug still n't root caused fixed . fact 's taken 2.5 year really acceptable self-driving car people 's life stake . ﬂow , development ﬂow , building way actually eﬃciently requires understanding infrastructure tool needed new kind software development . 's company world actually even know . nvidia 's something unique , right , company training ai network , 're training dgx system . 've built simulator based omniverse , q - c.j . muse - ali kanimake simulate av , 's actually truly accurate , could actually train network simulated object build . ca n't like open gl simulator , build new kind simulator . 's part software development ﬂow need reinvent recreate development ﬂow built av driving , 's say 's hard . expertise really something possible many oem's tier 1 . 's really good partner sort build expertise . think 's really try differentiate partner . spoke bit around working tier 2 , tier 3 , guess curious hear thought around think landscape look like full autonomous . world 're going kind partnering best breed kind radar lidar vision coming together full kind hardware solution force maybe tier 1 2 become specialized see kind future ? think u key , really want design platform open modular , oem tier 1 want develop application way , . example , case like genesect , genesect like tier 2 build self-driving application volvo . let build self-driving application platform pick want , sensor , radar develop self-driving application , support way . platform open , pick sensor , pick ai algorithm , either case partner tier 3 build 're tier 2. make decision 're supportive . -- case oems might want little bit support u . say , platform designed modular open . first example , 're open want build . 's modular , let 's say , case mercedes-benz , actually want u give self-driving application . kind sort help inform , let 's want invest sensor 'll build software kind involved happens . platform designed modular really depends oems . n't think one way right way way wrong way . actually feel like 's based , oem want invest . oems maybe focus electrification core o today , worry self-driving application development maybe later maybe never , right ? try solution . actually , think , 're perfectly fine saying , let tier 2 tier 3 tier 1 define want develop platform , think 's great business want make sure support customer . q - c.j . muse - ali kani q - c.j . muse - ali kanihelpful . lot excitement around partnership mercedes-benz . curious 's sort update share term recent activity timing ramp drive agx ? mean , think 's update , think 's 're working hard together . 's great partnership . trying build software-defined vehicle 's fully upgradeable life car . think 's going richest parking self-driving application industry . 're designing 're going make better , customer going buy car , car go , lot improve life car . think 's really exciting partnership 're really excited working beyond . guess broadly speaking , critical design watching perhaps magnitude revenue contribution perspective next five year ? well , let sort break area . think 's -- course , mercedes-benz engagement something look . 's going kick-in back half range , right , car go production 2024 , take year ramp full 2.5 million vehicle ﬂeet , ramp entire ﬂeet . think oem design , traditional branded design volvo saic also ramping significant . would say , 's couple bucket sort put together , 's navs ramp starting next year . 's lot car 're selling 's multiple computer car , right ? neo announced four orin 's per vehicle , many others multiple orin 's per vehicle . scale , 's sizable attractive business 'll scaling . finally , 's self-driving vehicle . look robotaxis look self driving truck , almost developing platform going kick volume put ecosystem together , asp course robotaxi , 're buying single orin , buying like multiple discrete gpus , highest ampere gpus . 's case $ 10,000 content per robotaxi nvidia . take multiply large volume base , think that's another big sort inﬂection point 'll see year come . think ramp time frame 're saying . 's pipeline actually growing healthy . q - c.j . muse - ali kani q - c.j . muse - ali kanihelpful . know jetson focus driving recurring revenue , curious , obviously , 's hardware software aspect focus . priority think pricing kind driving razor blade model ? kind indifferent term pricing hardware versus software ? yes . mean , think tried charge based value think we're bringing table . think like . think 's recurring revenue multiple way . course , build application customer upgrade feature function buy car , there's recurring revenue . even n't build application , 're building production vehicle safe secure , need maintain release life car , 's fee . every oem go production safe code , almost need branch code give stable branch . 's recurring revenue well customer . think recurring revenue stream based software support pick software application customer well traditional chip o customer go production , 'll need continue maintain support vehicle life car . helpful . guess maybe would love hear perspective competitive landscape , obviously mobileye , qualcomm . kind see -- kind see thing see thing evolving next 5 , 10 year ? mean , think market good number competitor capable , reasonably good strategy . feel like 's good industry . there's good option , good choice . try differentiate strategy , right ? like 're unique first platform open . develop platform 're oem , tier 2 tier 3. take learning improve software hardware next-generation engagement . second really solution infrastructure side . like said back ﬂow think actually key differentiator anyone building autonomous driving . helping customer training solution simulation solution 's kind unique nvidia . end-to-end platform , especially differentiation infrastructure , really help u differentiate . case customer want build self-driving application traditional way . mentioned ( inaudible ) mobileye use . approach little bit ncap fixed-function cv based av . approach q - c.j . muse - unidentified speaker - ali kani q - c.j . muse - ali kani q - c.j . muselittle bit deep learning , software defined computer . design platform programmable heavy deep learning , 's different building ncap chip , 's fixed function . 've never seen mobileye product otaed life , 've production many year . 'll try ota car one day , 'm saying n't built software programmable software defined . 's dsp type architecture . 're trying approach different way . think 're investing 're differentiated place oems going , 's place seek differentiation . really like positioning . think result show win 've announcing . n't seen many new win people , right ? like 's pretty much bunch nvidia win . one area think 'll see competition level 4 , level 5. think mobileye level 4 , level 5 win . strategy little bit different , want zoox 's , cruise 's aurora 's , guy sort leader industry , clearly . think mobileye go people ca n't build kind build platform . strategy hyperion , 'll give hardware platform build application , build av . think strategy right one robotaxi cycle . longer-term , may av solution help people space , right ? take time , 're focused l2 l3 today , l4 l5 come future . 've got roughly two minute left . leave time term perhaps summarizing fail ask anything think important relevant , let kind conclude half-hour investor . hear ? n't think ali hear . could n't hear anything . ? hear . hear . - ali kani q - c.j . muse - ali kani q - c.j . museso 've got minute left . going turn either share something n't touch , think important perhaps , give quick summary ending thought . . mean , think 've asked really good question think covered thing . mean , think one thing 'll say , automotive industry right , amount area see fundamental transformation significant . self-driving car , 's also electrification . think one thing wanted say , think one area n't yet seen significant investment , think going exciting inside cockpit . today cockpit experience cluster entertainment , legacy application meet need multiple solution . long-term , experience car , 's going kind like concierge . av like chauffeur , driving car , actually concierge car 's extremely intelligent personalized like , interact , talk , enjoy show , video conferencing . amount ai 's needed enable true concierge experience significant 're yet seeing car . think 's area 'll see innovation longer term . also area nvidia unique able provide experience , 's self-driving software , 's like ai software , 's video conferencing software , speech , asr , kind technology putting together driver monitoring document monitoring fusing av experience outside car maybe child get car 's car coming behind let happen leave car might left purse laptop concierge tell , wallet purse back want leave car . much innovation possible fusion -- fusing av ai inside car , think 's going area differentiation long-term we're excited work today , n't success mention yet , think 'll area 're going exciting opportunity long-term . get jetson 's oven inside car ? well , ali , thank much today . 's always great spend time . thank wish great health , close . thank , guy . appreciate . 're . - ali kani bye .
