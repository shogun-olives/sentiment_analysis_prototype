'm joe mayer , morgan stanley research . happy today colette kress nvidia . wish , colette , meeting last year , 'd listened everything told believed . ( laughter ) ( inaudible ) lot better . guy great year , obviously . thank much . know 's lot anticipation . maybe 'll get right . maybe start gaming business , seems like focus people right -- 59 % revenue . great year , grew 44 % , 59 % sequentially third quarter , -- 've never seen business size kind kind unexpected growth . talk drove . make guy bullish gaming base going forward ? sure . gaming -- basis company 15 , 20 year . built company one key application gpu gaming . really changed approach gaming last several year . last year one key year u well . last year continuing evolve overall gaming industry . gaming industry used start one-on-one play . right ? overall computer . 's really moved social platform . 's moved social platform playing friend . 's one gamer time . 're usually two-by-two , 're playing overall friend . approach enable gaming platform every type gamer . lot different card . last year took place term enabling pascal come market . pascal amazing architecture , architecture 're using across company ; , importantly , term launch , term gaming , brought market probably card ever done shorter period time . successful overall launch ; , strong acceptance card performance . performance improvement detainable [ ph ] last generation substantial . even platform many year , essentially no-brainer type thought term upgrade potential could . approach pascal architecture opportunity u enable future . ever want play vr , ability term pascal . combination see term expanding market gamers -- gamers coming onboard social experience , gamers staying longer , gamers coming onboard broadband access never past -- ability enjoy see term sister country nearby . , also , probably best architecture , best overall platform , term market . 've able continue increase unit increase overall asp gamers . 's lot discussion say -- well , ? , strong second half . 're talking gaming overall result growing 60 % year year two quarter . underlying fundamental gaming industry still . still taking place thing change [ ph ] . u last night , also san francisco , gdc street , actually announced yet another pascal card . announced 1080 ti , 35 % performance improvement existing 1080 market . also made room term overall price point 1080 come $ 699 price point . , enabling different type enthusiastic gamers partake term gaming , different type price point great card . still believe healthy part market u capture . joe mayer colette kress joe mayer , guess , parse product cycle aspect ? pascal obviously huge cycle . talked reason people adopting faster . 've rolled lot family quicker , although 's actually pretty exciting , new family talk . adoption cycle sort consolidate revenue gain point ? see number continuing grow level ? think , guess , 's also encouraging 've seen growth pc gaming software stronger 've seen long time well last couple quarter . much adoption cycle versus growth aspect population ( inaudible ) ? yes , think 's good question . rollout different platform , upgrade complete ? answer absolutely . overall cycle often actually refresh overall gaming platform may somewhere three-and-a-half , four year . 's still early u tell . take three-and-a-half , four year determine cycle still . compare look well 're last architecture term maxwell , 's still really early , 're two quarter selling overall pascal , process take three-and-a- half four year . far , 're moving faster , little bit faster , pascal . feel great . think see establishment gamers also , overall , driving ability sell term additional unit . 's necessarily refresh . take u little bit time see . 'll probably see continue refreshing occur way current year we're . okay , 's helpful . guess one helpful distinction guy made last year oem versus gaming . oem declining . gaming actually growing good clip quite time . 's showing . getting bigger part number . talk little bit parsing . 've seen shift ? colette kress joe mayer colette kress joe mayer sure . took opportunity couple year ago really concentrate game platform . sell gpus general-purpose pc , probably several one audience today . said , sure , 's little bit graphic capability want certain application -- different level play several high-end game . really market build certain platform exclusively gaming market . classify gaming . time , 's range probably $ 100 price point market , feel people , spending much money , actually see geforce experience -- sign , download driver game . ability actually look say yes , intended use overall gaming platform actually used gaming . 's essentially split overall oem business . 's small part business . represents probably le 5 % business . 's necessarily growish time , 're still point overall pc growth ; even discrete gpu attached strong reason , term something would buy term pc . still strategically aligned oems pc platform , term supporting . 's different price point different asp . significant amount volume , mass amount pc . , 's small part business . okay . 's helpful . , divisive point term gaming business . think investor map , much growth price versus unit . know n't go distinction . maybe qualitatively , people view 's price . seems u 's unit price , actually , like-for-like pricing n't changed much , maxwell pascal . 're probably getting people trading higher-end skus . talk little bit ? yes . good old discussion asp versus unit growth -- colette kress joe mayeryou give top line . could , could go . take opportunity , year , look seen historically last couple year term asp unit growth gaming . keep mind , looked day day , month month , given launch , sometimes launch know going volume play . launch know going high-end card 's going certain part market , essentially drive asp . looking short period time , may interesting thing pop . done 've looked long period time . based see factor , seeing . seeing growth term unit , seeing growth asp . last five year , overall gaming business , half year ago , growing 30 % , 30 % growth top line . faster , yes , overall gaming market . talked unit growth probably 9 % . asp growth 11 % . multiplying factor get overall 30 % . finish fiscal year 2017 growth term around little bit higher 30 % , probably mid-30s higher type cagr period , factor occurring . nothing materially changed , , strong part [ ph ] 2017 helped . think 're still seeing aspect growth asp well growth term unit . responded [ ph ] increase price pascal ? answer really . think overall price performance , 've said . , another way saying , many time , 're actually getting performance better price 're . goal . goal overall increase price , turn . seeing people continuing choose higher-end card play game . truly see benefit sometimes playing exact game better gpu better experience . 's like playing different game . get benefit upgrading next time buying gpu higher card . also , therefore , overall asp grip . okay . 's helpful . colette kress joe mayer colette kressthen , element people ask way boosting dollar per customer , whether 's founder edition card selling dram kind thing . sense thing pretty small . address ? yes . pretty small . get question founder edition -- goal ? overall excitement , term founder edition ? 's small percentage . think launch process work , last night gamer actually able receive 1080 ti , next week . 's put founder edition , allows u build board ready close launch possible . take excitement launch . feel excitement week , actually received . 's still small percentage . price point founder edition also slightly higher . keep mind , 's also different component . felt actually selling company , would expect high-end component , rich component could put . given volume play term component , slightly higher price keep . really , overall purpose keep excitement launch receive overall card quite quickly . 's one piece . 're right , 's material part . okay . great . overall , sound like 're pretty constructive growth gaming segment . 's , guess , view 's discontinuity recently . yet , seems like guidance generally seasonal kind result . way 're looking current quarter ? yes . gaming market seasonality . probably one -- one seasonality see versus market . seasonality stronger second half year first half year . sometimes , growth term second half year largely inﬂuenced holiday season . mean season , 's worldwide holiday . 's western world inﬂuences . 've seen . 're going likely see first half different 've seen second half year . given strength fiscal year 2017 , seasonality still . given see term q1 , seasonality probably continue . joe mayer colette kress joe mayer colette kress joe mayer okay . great . , one last question gaming topic -- amd competition -- time last year , feel like people worried amd 's polaris , turned pretty much entry level . platform well entry level . , 're talking vega challenging high end . least , 's aspiration . talk 're hearing customer . think market share ? sure . 've competing amd since beginning time . discrete market player . different way go market , though . really different way actually approach gamer . look , surround ecosystem around gamer geforce experience , additional feature enable certain game , working overall software developer ? n't approach oem sale . delightful partner channel work reach different gamers . although amd continue path 've gone market , [ ph ] say let 's talk performance , 've still also continued out-beat performance . think 's gamers demand u . demand best-of-breed . brand loyalty , think , . know compete . competing . heard might come vega . 've talking . think 're well prepared . think 1080 ti , significantly better even 1080 , seen comparison comparing vega 1080 -- 'm sure 're following type game , always know we'll always something better come . okay . think 1080 ti , even already , great piece u launch . okay . 's helpful . colette kress joe mayer colette kressand leave graphic business , want touch enterprise , pro visualization business . guy talked gdp growth type business . yet grew double digit last year . talk drove ? possibility optimization ? sure . pro visualization -- importance using graphic enterprise key many different type business . importance mobility key collaboration overall work . seen mobile workforce , term wanting high- performance gpu thin-and light . moving form factor allow take work work everywhere . continued move higher-end gpus thin workstation overall get . coming . secondly , see ability render spot , ability render quickly , smooth process timing high-end gpus leveraging gpu use rendering . taking advantage , , highest-end gpus . becoming successful term growth rate . 're , pleased growth rate proviz -- mature , well- established leadership position . able grow 11 % last year . 'll continue focus mobility . 'll continue focus enabling better better rendering move forward . going option . okay . great . shifting gear , mean , , obviously exciting part story -- le divisive , think -- 's one 're excited -- datacenter-oriented business . grew 144 % last year . 's 14 % sale amount [ ph ] . starting really move needle . give u overview business . maybe talk split high-performance compute , traditional part , deep learning business like grid ? yes . success datacenter business , could n't pleased . know lot folk datacenter business really talk growth rate . leave q4 tripling , 's pretty good part . enable many different business underneath . think would good u understand different piece . yes , high-performance computing business . high-performance computing business u eight 10 year . solving mathematical computation using accelerated computing , area , sure , derive overall formula , move working parallel function breaking apart . know answer . using accelerated computing gpu successful . business still growing quite nicely core part starting point datacenter business . last couple year , 've seen evolution beginning ai . primarily use deep learning training . started one second business , deep learning overall hyperscales , using deep learning training application workload use every day . search command , voice search command , image detection , natural language processing , video encoding thing see . business definitely thriving great opportunity u . thirdly , also seen evolution say -- get enterprise ? move ai deep learning . computing capability accelerated computing , using gpu , enterprise ? past , maybe 10 15 year ago , department would go build . 're seeing build-out cloud instance , cloud instance cloud service provider enabling gpu instance . also key component datacenter business , many cloud service provider seen continue launch gpu instance . , gpu instance used many thing -- one , definitely ai deep learning training enterprise get started , term 's already set . thing would n't on-premise cloud . number two , also ability virtualization cloud . ability put workstation , application pc cloud available virtualized scenario well . , number three , overall compute . want high-performance computing cloud , also overall capability . 's area third business growing . take u overall grid business . grid business outside cloud also enterprise installing on-premise business well , order expand overall workforce collaboration tied overall workstation ; able show across world . joe mayer colette kressthen , lastly , dgx supercomputing ai -- also ability enterprise quick-start . 're talking fully contained ai supercomputer eight gpus , overall computing development platform , inclusive different framework deep learning ; ability enterprise plug get started see right big excitement around ai . five different business . ai [ ph ] probably fastest- growing piece , definitely , term datacenter business . thank . deep learning piece particular , think , pretty exciting , given priority cloud company putting deep learning , thing 's enabling term particularly visual data -- entirely new function . guess 's hard business size . know 've sort resisted temptation put cap big get . think ? multiple year runway ? think term attach rate traditional cpu , think thing , supporting workload ? yes . 's good question . think challenge would refer hesitation [ ph ] . think 's -- think 's diﬃcult first couple year take dot extrapolate line . 's hard problem , say , 're first couple inning , 're seeing term ai market . think truly believe see datacenter , see ai , new computing model u decade move forward . still early stage . 's hard . second part question , though , say , start ? attach rate cpu ? another way could term bottoms-up workload ? answer . ﬂaws term way . come tops-down approach , say , percentage -- 're single digit , half billion dollar . 's necessarily overly accurate stage 're seeing . , get little bit farther , think would little bit easier . think 's important look type workload interested . and/or type industry interested . probably one key thing surrounding anything 're data , following data . significant amount data either structured and/or joe mayer colette kressunstructured , could leveraged powerful useful end user , could apply ability deep learning training , essentially say let computer write program understand overall information ? area 're seeing rise [ ph ] different application talked hyperscales . also see industry large amount data -- finance , automotive -- see also high-end retailer trying process amount information , whether inventory buying pattern use term ai manner . think 're going see continuation workload expand industry expand . 's far determine fast one move forward . focus endorsing working different type framework deep learning , knowing one popular , knowing one trended towards certain workload . making sure empower additional code , additional library , self- starting capability ; get ai everywhere . 's approach . great . thinking standpoint kind training , building neural network versus inference ; deploying using real-time environment -- seems clear guy dominating least early stage training , instruction set , cuda instruction set sort de facto way solving problem . also best graphic engine , certainly help . think inference , natural advantage training work way inference market ? 's status kind going specialty ? today , think inference happening cpu . even intel saying there's going lot specialty silicon used inference application . 's gpu prospect space ? yes . 's really good question . inference new , something 's . 're right , 's dominated cpu could anything custom asic . given complexity inference could , right , 's definitely opportunity gpu , work 's done training , also definitely capable term inference phase [ ph ] . gpu today essentially really , really large , capable custom asic case , lot different job time one complete architecture together . 've built purpose , core competency -- joe mayer colette kresspushing high-end capable custom asic something 're good continue . move forward , 'll move high-end inference going necessary gpu . thing need voice command , thing need voice processing , prime example gpu may , well suited inference . 's vast wide market . 's going many different type inferencing solution term . single-function low-end microprocessor probably 're going focusing . 'll focus term high end necessary . okay . great . one datacenter question . 'll open audience . , n't question , 'll move auto financial stuff . talked dgx getting corporate environment . 've actually heard department working gpu-related training project . 's happened kind faster would 've thought , 're sort least getting awareness enterprise environment . talk little bit ? thing differently 're selling enterprise versus selling hyperscale ? yes . think 's good question . yes . finance industry , excited ability work dgxs get started quite quickly . sophisticated department . 's fast-starting capability . 's essentially containerized ability start overall ai . moving faster expected ? . actually believed way enterprise would likely go market get excited ai . prepare knowledge , deep learning , knowledge deep learning training framework . put box essentially agnostic whatever framework wanted , concentrated . 're continuing evolve even make better better . allows quick start , u taking part middleware n't worry . worry application letter ( inaudible ) worry data . bring , . we've already started significant amount work . joe mayer colette kress joe mayer unidentified participant colette kressbut also took u enabling working enterprise . yes . relationship high-performance computing . 's different type market different type user . 've seen u term expansion sale force , sale enabling . working different enterprise . 've seen , quite globally , reaching spreading word . additionally , many different program continue train enterprise deep learning . call deep learning institute . amount training hour , people like -- want learn , deep learning work -- u using training hour teach enterprise . additionally , sure , enterprise mean go purchase high- end system . also working startup . many , many different ai startup , 're inception program , allows fresh start , helping cache side hardware side , go get started term business . thing done continue spread . 's building piece hardware . 's significant amount software , there's significant amount socialization training continue enterprise . yes , took cuda dummy class developer conference amsterdam . actually surprisingly easy pick . 'd say -- probably one biggest sold-out part , drink line ( multiple speaker ) . let stop see question audience . maybe could comment inventory little bit . know 's elevated level balance sheet . also comment inventory sits gaming partner . aib [ ph ] guy like msi , gigabyte , colorful , pallet [ ph ] ? compare last year ? happy inventory level ? q - unidentified participant - colette kress - joe mayersure . inventory level take part different architecture across different business . keep mind gaming inventory related pascal architecture . probably something launched term last night , term overall inventory getting ready , term launch piece . keep mind , gaming business , working supplying overall chip adding card partner . also significant amount kitting , actually kit overall memory together . 's part practice . good part overall inventory associated lot high-end platform well . unique different market outside gaming , case quadro workstation , well datacenter , selling multiple year architecture . selling coupler . selling maxwell . selling pascal . unique enterprise versus see normally gaming . always keeping different thing . assure capability lock infrastructure done continue add onto . overall inventory really represents see term future sale , well think need term supporting different architecture . question answer term inventory customer ? seems recurring fear 's much ? customer would gamers . think ( multiple speaker ) talked term channel color , good ability see worldwide . good market share . , healthy channel relationship individually partner . consistent timing year , timing around different holiday . timing term term new architecture . 're comfortable overall channel level . q - unidentified participant - colette kress q - unidentified participant - colette kressany question audience ? thank . large datacenter company , company datacenters -- like google , facebook , microsoft -- rumored working deep learning chip , particularly google . happens , effect business ? yes . would n't surprise anybody one would look say , something want purchase , something could actually build ? always going pro con term . 's type solution . lot approach say -- want build custom asic piece inference piece machine learning ? , 's different statement -- want build complete custom asic deep learning training ? 's much , much harder , bigger challenge go . keep mind , company agile , 're generally coming launching something quite often . 're going keep quite toe term capability move quite fast . sometimes , time may process overnight , think want come something custom , may market next day something . 's got something overall balance . 's lot different way solve inference problem , solve machine learning simpler type data problem , versus capability performance gpu really , really hard substitute . destroy significant amount value gain got term time tco , leveraging overall gpu . wo n't surprise u . 's going necessarily change believe vast market large market gpu . may also instance custom asic may well . sort compare contrast see hyperscale relative traditional enterprise ? something particular relevant hyperscale customer maybe much relevant traditional enterprise ? seeing ? - joe mayer q - unidentified participant - colette kress q - unidentified participant - colette kress q - unidentified participant - colette kressyes . mean , 's good question say -- would enterprise look building something ? 's going challenging , 're looking talent actually build . 's actually short process . keep mind , think nvidia , thousand thousand developer whose focus gpu . 's living . 's they've done entire career . probably largest workforce associated building design anything else world . n't think see large thing enterprise would . 're already seeing right fulfilling dgx , container type approach . and/or leveraging cloud , meeting significant amount current demand want go . 's necessarily ai approached overall . 's still early say . think 're correct mean , get talent , justify overall time market , ability outperform something would commercially available u , might something might look . still may meet exact need high-end gpus right . time one quick one . quick question -- basically , barrier increase processing power bandwidth memory ? talk , something nvidia looking next couple year improve ? also , comment quickly longer term , like three ; five-year outlook , gaming datacenter demand gpus ? thanks . ( multiple speaker ) . last half -- 'm sorry -- question gaming datacenter -- datacenter demand gpu , cagr [ ph ] mix five-year . anything -- long-term growth rate ? long-term growth rate . sure . could go [ ph ] , hit long term one . - joe mayerlet take first part question first term memory . 's essentially question scale scale . depending workload , going matter , term put together , want get overall scale go consistently memory . 's always continued work term architecture , overall bus express memory overall gpu , well term core architecture hardware chip . right , challenge term memory . 'll continue work . many workload , 's even close issue , see overall need . long term , term gaming datacenter -- little crystal ball , would lovely piece . 's hard say . , business healthy . driver inﬂuenced u last year still . n't go away changed clock moved 2017. overall growth rate speed growth really hard u say . colette , thank much , 's helpful .
