'm walter pritchard , software analyst citi , super-excited scott guthrie microsoft . telling saw wearing red shirt , think scott -- n't know , 've microsoft longer 've alive probably 've worn red shirt presume every day every time see public 's got red shirt . scott used front man -- least got know , front man company around developer developer big part microsoft gotten today term loyalty million .net developer . scott , kind roll , think satya nadella moving ceo role , sort fill behind satya run enterprise cloud business . big part revenue microsoft , server product well azure . scott 's going spend 10 minute giving u background business focused , 'll jump back q & 've done session . great . thanks bunch . well , good afternoon thank joining u today looking forward opportunity spend time . mentioned , name scott guthrie run cloud enterprise group microsoft . microsoft , one thing satya talked quite bit last six month fact live mobile-first , cloud-first world . across microsoft , 're working hard deliver set solution really enable customer fully take advantage new world . within cloud enterprise group , deliver number core enterprise server product enable world , specifically window server , system center , active directory , sql business associated data product , visual studio developer product also microsoft azure commercial cloud computing platform . 've hard kind charging cloud first world really last two year within cloud enterprise group 're seeing really nice momentum adoption . last 12 month , 've gained five point market share versus vmware on-premises private cloud business really seeing nice run rate . public cloud base , 57 % fortune 500 running solution deployed top microsoft azure . passed 1 million sql database deployed azure 're seeing growth steadily 10 % month-over-month . 30 trillion object toward azure storage system . 300 million user inside azure active directory 're processing 13 billion authentication per week . 've got 1.6 million developer registered new visual studio online service , provides set saas service developer cloud . 's service launched past november . adoption driving really nice revenue number well . see cloud enterprise fy14 revenue growth 13 % year-over-year . 're particularly pleased diversity growth . fy14 five separate business within cloud enterprise $ 1 billion revenue . sql business particular fire last couple year . passed $ 6 billion year mark last year grew 19 % year-over- year . even looking mature server product on-premise space , like window server system center , 're seeing really nice mix shift standard premium edition product 're able grow premium revenue space 40 % year-over-year . commercial cloud , announced part fourth quarter earnings passed $ 4.4 billion year annualized run rate commercial cloud , basically oﬃce 365 azure . azure growing 150 % year-over-year . overall good market [ ph ] momentum . term one question people often ask event like , well , differentiate cloud offering versus others market . one thing often talked customer three like circle capability think combination make u unique . really basically hyper-scale , enterprise grade hybrid microsoft cloud cloud three , combined , think really provides truly unique cloud offering enables differentiated solution customer . want spend rest time drilling kind giving sense ﬂavor term one combination really unique enterprise space . one element hyper-scale cloud cloud really truly provides global reach . 've hard work azure side , last 12 month particular , building azure footprint run world . today , 17 region around world customer go ahead deploy code kind global footprint enables customer deploy solution closer customer well employee ever . put perspective , actually two time number region aws opened around world today 's five time number region google cloud . kind fairly unique scale opportunity . make region truly impressive though size . 's really kind differentiate , 'd call , hyper-scale cloud provider sort traditional hosting co-lo environment . region basically consists data center data center approximately size one football field length . 's impressive fact region ( inaudible ) park two plane inside , 's feature n't use much , give kind sense size building . make unique though fact region one data center , 16 , really huge amount capacity , enough run 600,000 server region one region . remember 17 open around world . kind hyper-scale footprint really enables immense scale economics , point basically continually cut price customer basically run operation cheaper pretty much everyone else planet . also give customer ability instantly scale capacity pretty much anywhere around world full confidence . ultimately think going basically three hyper-scale provider world , u , amazon google . basically differentiate two circle capability , enterprise grade , providing truly differentiated enterprise offering term service level well ability hybrid take advantage hybrid computing . 're hyper-scale provider actually software run cloud well on-premise customer environment well service provider environment . kind enables customer basically maximize existing investment easily bridge cloud kind enable truly unique solution . kind provide pretty wide range solution whether ranging backup dr database replication identity management cloud , 're going see u build kind capability time . think fact large on-premise footprint provides u natural attach cloud , , enables u take scale economics drive cost cheaper anyone else market . hyper-scale , enterprise grade , hybrid , azure cloud microsoft vendor delivers three , combined , really think provide truly unique offering enables u provide service enterprise business really one else market allows u compete hard . -- one thing focus within c & e notion call kind pillar solution focus . 'll kind walk little bit trend data center pillar capability provide term core infrastructure . slide also talk end-to-end scenario 're focusing , combination think provides kind really compelling offering enterprise actually leverage solution , even . n't use u infrastructure cloud , category allow u provide really good value well . give kind sense , 'm going quickly walk two one , enterprise mobility unlock insight data . enterprise mobility front , one thing 're looking enable employee basically use device love keeping company secure . launched may new suite call enterprise mobility suite , basically combine number different capability kind one nice bundle customer enables basically enable employee productive device want use connect saas-based solution want use well . part , include intune offering , provides mobile device management . work including io well android-based device provides way basically enforce policy top employee fairly non-intrusive way take advantage bring-your-own-device trend we're seeing enterprise . also add identity integration part suite core differentiator . enables single sign-on 2,000 different saas application , including one running inside cloud environment . part suite , actually provide 's called saas discovery capability enterprise , cio , could actually look network log actually determine saas apps they've approved enterprise using , hundred saas apps employee taking advantage , n't know . discover , basically go azure quickly wire adapt , allows enforce single sign-on corporate company credential solution . basically two step enable salesforce.com , support workday , concur , google apps , kick , even let manage aws way provides really nice solution allows enterprise keep identity secure . might heard news , little bit hacking going celebrity earlier week . one thing 's built solution kind compelling built-in machine learning employee logging , detect suspicious behavior like loss password , reset attempt loss incorrect password someone 's supposed new york logging romania , basically -- automatically file alert security oﬃcers automatically enforce two factor authentication top device . next time log , actually also answer say sm challenge addition knowing password . combination kind provides much secure solution . 're also part enabling remote desktop support running cloud . basically allows organization run window client application want cloud expose different type device . io , android well window client . user basically click sign using security mechanism immediately productive existing window application regardless device 're using , running safely cloud , optionally bridged hybrid way on-premises environment . basically kind huge opportunity u fy15 . , price list literally week fy14 've seen really , really strong demand . 's nice 's kind solution think really tailored mobile-first , cloud-first world , 's also one allows 're uniquely positioned sale motion perspective clearly attache lot existing motion 're going see u aggressively go solution every oﬃce 365 customer ( inaudible ) every time customer renews one client access license u , every two three year . kind obvious attach 're going able part motion . 's great , , work regardless infrastructure cloud using 's kind easy attach saas-based solution well . last thing walk really quickly unlock insight data pillar . core part value proposition really deliver set data solution enable customer get insight well run business better . mentioned earlier , sql business $ 6 billion year run rate , growing 19 % . q - walter pritchardin addition kind core sql work , also whole bunch additional data service 're providing , increasingly going forward , 'll see u move data analytics space , category n't really compete today think right disruption really nice adjacent business u add . 'll also see u continue add additional saas capability data space , one 'll quick demo power bi . basically saas-based solution enables organization create operational dashboard enterprise . 's nice seamlessly integrates on-premise data sql business , also people 's data on-prem , including oracle , ibm , sap et cetera , also designed kind embrace mobile- first , cloud-first world saas , also pull data saas provider well . example , sale force integration 'll demo second , fact 'll roll video , kind see quick view action . ( video playing ) 's one sort simple example term data product we're coming market later year , think , , nice adjacent business kind core business provide today . example actually leverage take advantage on- prem world cloud world azure well saas-based infrastructure cloud provider . term providing kind quick overview 's little bit business , solution . going go detail one , think combined , really provide set offering regardless customer looking transform data center , store analyze data , manage mobile workforce , create internet thing enable next generation application , great solution . compose incredibly well think go enterprise market awful lot money 've made healthy business u drive long-term . , 'm going open question . question answer ( technical diﬃculty ) give u sense using ? 've outlined number business case . typically people get going though pretty simple thing . talk u demographic 57 % using ? - scott guthrie q - walter pritchard - scott guthrie 's interesting . mean , think lot people , think cloud , think term existing perspective , hey , n't want service on-prem . move cloud . think certainly element organization looking way kind reduce infrastructure cost thing like . would say majority use case 're seeing right cloud though much additive traditional department would . particular , would say customer-facing solution thing seem migrating cloud fastest . look lot customer today , 's often department business within often outside actually making shift cloud fastest . example one u would tesco uk largest retailer . division called blinkbox , kind netﬂix uk provide premium medium streaming service . first department tesco actually aggressively embraced azure basically reinvented streaming infrastructure cloud base . seeing success , 're starting see department within tesco also kind make shift including kind traditional . right , would say , people asked earlier today , cloud cannibalizing on-prem business replacing . right , would say 's much additive , think big opportunity cloud fact whole bunch scenario people either n't today 's costly , u , selfishly , vendor cloud allows u kind basically enter market new way end much automation opposed service level . take data analytics example . think huge opportunity machine learning kind democratized predictive analytics , nice profitable business several people . hope profitable business u . real good example transition give u opportunity conversation n't today . expect time next two three year continues additive business ? think see migration part business , say , timeframe ? think u , certainly near term , think 's going continue additive business . one thing focused business strategy perspective also , kind design business model end hopefully additive long-term perspective . example , today make money window server license . q - walter pritchard - scott guthrie q - walter pritchard - scott guthrie q - walter pritchard right . 's fairly small percentage overall spend window server . azure world even aws world , still make money window server license , want world cloud , opportunity certainly make money storage layer , networking layer , compute layer , additive management service go around frankly monetize today . hope even type world , see server shift on-prem cloud opportunity u additive net set . [ ph ] think , guess , maybe get business -- running economics perspective , expect -- impact expect revenue profit look c & e business next , say , two , three year undergo transition ? -- 've seen company move cloud type business model , headwind maybe absorb business sold upfront ongoing basis , business n't seen much headwind . expect term revenue profit ? well , think term -- kind talked little bit finance beginning . term -- right kind unique position whole bunch different business really fire good way . business slightly different space term think transition cloud . would say lot scenario even one walked , take power bi , enterprise mobility suite , net additive existing client access license business well existing sql business . 's case migration cloud , type cloud service , n't replace existing revenue le shift license annuity might expect . lot business inside c & e today , infrastructure perspective , beyond additive scenario , also annuity-based . large part -- majority revenue based enterprise agreement , kind three-year , two , three-year renewal . also kind change dynamic little bit business -- competitor probably transactional-based , give u little bit smoother ramp [ ph ] well think . okay . got . another sort economic question , amazon google pretty ruthless . amazon google kind entered fray term leaning price pushing pricing . - scott guthrie q - walter pritchardlargely matched roughly matched price decrease pushed . get point start become impactor profitability term business ? amazon profit company , give take . concern manage concern term relentless push price ? well , think term -- think way thought business , couple fold . one , want go enterprise provide kind total package solution enterprise , need infrastructure business able offer type service price always , think many case commodity-driven . n't mean sophisticated important , price set market . 've made decision azure , -- match commodity price amazon . cut price , usually within 48 hour cut . 's basically think combined together . need kind cut price need match . , think , accelerated overall adoption pretty nice way 's gotten u position , thing like storage particular , probably price anyone else market offer , three u , kind put u nice structural position . yet , cost economics actually continue still long- term profitable business . portfolio perspective , think type infrastructure going key . thing want balance though also higher value service , take analytics , take device management enterprise mobility suite , take machine learning , take data-as-a-service kind much higher margin offering , able kind overall package , think end unique . would say , also versus amazon google , infrastructure side , we're also slightly unique position n't monetize compute storage . also monetize license software running vm . whenever amazon sell window vm , make decent amount money . likewise azure , sell vm running window , make also decent amount money . think gross margin core compute , 's bad might think actually make fairly decent chunk software running inside vm well . change overall dynamic probably margin business way 's probably different taking competitor . okay , got . actually going kind go next talk bit platform versus infrastructure . sense disclosure around business become transparent last year , really get sense what's going . - scott guthrie q - walter pritchard - scott guthrie q - walter pritchard - scott guthriei think little bit diﬃcult tell , appears though azure business really took added infrastructure option sort came mainstream market . highlighted attach ip , intellectual property window sort people building apis , 's unique offer charge versus commodity product . talk sort adoption point platform level service , thing ultimately higher margin today think future versus commodity piece ? yeah , think definitely infrastructure side , mean , lot -- azure business made pretty substantial change interim perspective two year ago really first previewed infrastructure service capability later ga'ed . fact , infrastructure-as-a-service ga'ed year ago , april . 's actually le 18 month since sla . we've seen huge growth . know , analogy often use people , 're going shopping like shopping mall 're going store , premium service people end thinking store want get purchasing , also -- 're going buy stuff [ ph ] , going buy something 's much ( inaudible ) often motivates trip mall begin . gap azure cloud strategy premium stuff , n't infrastructure capability close gap , certainly much complete offering . sale motion perspective well , way increasingly sell azure enterprise 's called enterprise agreement basically someone buy , say , $ 1 million azure capacity usage , spend infrastructure well premium service often see kind motion , 'll call land expand people start infrastructure desktop 'll quickly expand premium service . think 's key part kind overall motion . another thing 've -- 've watching introduced -- last question asked percentage coverage -- yeah , right . exactly . think disclosed q4 number half azure customer also using premium service rate actually q - walter pritchard - scott guthrie q - walter pritchardincreasing . kind land expand motion mentioned definitely one 're seeing usage perspective well revenue perspective . okay . thing 've noticed sort forward- thinking term supporting natively non-microsoft product top azure . mean , announcement oracle , 're supporting new sql database , , think , new sql database , sort release technology market . use example seeing change thinking microsoft last , say , three four year . ultimately think monetizing type offering -- 's premium service , 's ip might something either others get paid like oracle open source , ip built , sort technology running top azure ? yeah , analogy use within team , keep old friend make new friend . think past 've focused keeping friend , necessarily making new friend especially enterprise space , every enterprise combination lot different technology , whether 's deliberate , whether 's acquisition , oracle , sql , ibm shape form , whoever , say stuff work microsoft stuff kind closing bunch opportunity . frankly 's harder trusted vendor work stuff . think 's shift 've made last couple year think helped drive particular 's made big difference market . example , people room might know partnership last year oracle . fact , 're cloud vendor oracle certified oracle enterprise support . call oracle enterprise support someone else 's cloud , say , sorry , n't support , could 'll support cloud , fairly substantial change type relationship 've past oracle . 've done similar relationship sap . recently announced partnership salesforce . thing like analytics suite showed power bi integrate salesforce data . example , sure salesforce time add built-in analytics , offering ability , integrate well thousand saas vendor , 're able kind unique play think end appealing customer base get u much conversation ultimately win . got . part success story 's microsoft decade isvs , software vendor , developer inside company developer inside software company long history desktop vendor , software vendor server-based software vendor 've built software - scott guthrie q - walter pritchard - scott guthrieon top window server , azure ? know necessarily enterprise company , lot consumer company , building top ew sort stack . isv territory sort historically . isv traction azure ? yeah , certainly , would say think move cloud , think one thing important kind keep eye people move cloud infrastructure application obviously people move cloud adopt stack , custom infrastructure custom apps also saas . winning heart mind saas vendor going play important part . 's one core push azure beginning really , isv almost half azure revenue come isvs . 's actually much higher percentage think people might naturally think . way ultimately think need kind compete going term getting saas run apps top azure , top infrastructure well thing like , example , mobility suite power bi suite showed enable isvs integrate enterprise mobility suite free . 've got 2,000 saas vendor , including one running microsoft stack back-end cloud , integrated . also monetize enterprise selling enterprise mobility suite also kind core part ( inaudible ) motion n't whole stack isv . simply integrate construct interesting business model monetize well . definitely think ecosystem effect going really important u go . got . think maybe term dog-fooding software came microsoft . 's first place heard back maybe 15 year ago . azure large football field-sized infrastructure . business microsoft could leverage azure search , xbox live , oﬃce 365 ? talk u sort internally customer speak business leveraging azure capacity ? yeah . term pretty much every microsoft property app run top common infrastructure , football sized data center basically solution running inside . part -- software piece azure , kind multiple different thing apps process ( inaudible ) top . anytime use oﬃce 365 , authentication infrastructure go azure active directory . store thing one drive , 's going azure storage . use new oﬃce 365 video app , 're going medium service pack inside azure , et cetera . xbox live , likewise , run halo run titanfall game came early q - walter pritchard - scott guthrie q - walter pritchardthis year xbox one , 's 100 % azure . fact , titanfall game came one premier game xbox actually spent 250,000 virtual machine inside azure launch day , kind example sort extreme level capacity . think cloud , enables type elastic scale peak end month holiday season drop needed pay use . 're certainly looking use inside microsoft , skype likewise running azure . basically plan take probably two three year everything , pretty aggressively moving new stuff , also existing stuff kind moving top common software stack well . yes . mentioned 57 % fortune 500 using azure . 43 % using azure . go sale call hear feedback field force around 's holding people back , 's top three term people n't leveraging azure ? 's going 100 % today , 'm interested factor . well , think , mean -- think infrastructure solution released 12 18 month ago , bunch solution people would say , well , sound cool , n't know yet , look adoption last quarter two , 're also seeing hockey stick growth think 'll see even use case come pretty quickly . still people -- n't differentiate department . lot adoption cloud even 57 % still coming business unit department , particular product side customer facing side organization . think case , starting come party , great opportunity u , think seeing lot people , 've moved last year cloud general , hey , going big thing hey , use case win fully expect continue grow . got . note -- think talk generally around topic . woke morning checked ( inaudible ) reader saw sort landmark case right around data sovereignty . guess microsoft data center ireland something u.s. government saying want email data center ireland , sort brought ﬂoor recent issue 've heard around nsa sort outreach u.s. government , set industry back ? know 's sort concern highlighted tech exec could actually occur american company . seen regard ? - scott guthrie q - walter pritchard - scott guthrie 've seen revenue slowdown . mean , think nsa stuff first came , wondered , going cause people pause generally n't think people worried still paused people n't worried ended worried end . think something , industry perspective overall legal perspective , something think u need worry , industry , across world , across u.s. think brad smith kind spoken quite bit publicly term position . think 's going continue evolve think ask government clarify position well make sure good principle place think 's going ongoing dialog continue . got . last question 'll let crowd run . 've got breakout session starting , session pat gelsinger hot seat , talking vmware put stat , 've seen many time market share gain certainly virtualization space . could highlight u think 're gaining share ? either type customer type workload within installed base ? well , think historic play cloud enterprise 's worked well u basically provide great solution customer charge huge premium . certainly look data business today , lot hockey stick sql growth coming tier 1 workload enterprise edition premium product pricing , 's still third cost oracle tier 1 solution . solution enterprise credibility tier 1 significantly competitor , 'll see hockey stick revenue growth come . 's cheaper . tier 1 quality get reputation 're place right data space paying huge dividend . think also 've reached space virtualization category well people say , gosh , cheaper vmware , boy , offering pretty darn good . leader quadrant gartner . stuff ca n't 's integrated 's part window data center . would n't buy one server data center get without pay extra . think 's lot growth happened . thing think watch u window server 2003 going end life next summer hyper-v share window server 2003 exactly 0 % n't hyper-v window server 2003. window q - walter pritchard - scott guthrieserver 2003 instance get updated , think 's also going opportunity u gain significant virtualization share pure vmware environment grab pay little bit get window server data center get virtualization included part . think 's going give u nice growth momentum next 12 18 month well . great . well , scott , thanks lot coming . 'll get red shirt issue , great . thanks . thanks much .
