'm excited . thank coming last day jpmorgan . know incredibly busy conference . amazing exciting time health care . think 're familiar safe harbor statement . want get really get going . 'd like introduce nvidia . invented gpu 1999. created ability , something called programmable shaders , allowed artist kind , artist creating game , creating movie , really unleash creativity start creating virtual world . see , image latest game star war . amount computation need order allow light bounce surface look eye 's photorealistic incredible . computing platform technology used designer engineer kind design chair 're sitting , shoe 're wearing , jet engine go inside plane 're probably taking afternoon . need kind interactive 3d experience know designing , look , perform simulation . need able iterate . basis nvidia created first 10 year . think make hair look like hair ? make smoke look like smoke , fire look like fire ? incredible amount math computation physic . kind math physic scientific community really longing . approaching critical end 's called moore 's law . needed huge leap computing performance . needed get new level able attack different sized problem , thing 've never done , work data exploding new kind sensor created , whether 's astronomy 's climate weather simulation . platform , fantastic creating math physic , perfect platform accelerated computing high-performance computing . decided create computing platform called cuda . cuda computing platform allows high-performance computing , accelerated computing . put technology every product made , whether gaming card something went inside data center . made accessible , researcher , researcher academic institution , get hand technology . 6 seven year ago , computer vision research community , dusting shelf algorithmic approach called neural network . living sea digital data mobile phone 's going consumer internet , knew neural network could effective data . needed massive amount computation . turned nvidia gpu computing platform order . 've dedicating make deep learning artificial intelligence accessible possible make run fast possible . iterating making breakthrough like 're experiencing every day talk phone . also -- 's giant 20-plus year data science 's based machine learning method . past year , nvidia put marketplace work 've several year , accelerating -- gpu accelerating also machine learning traditional approach industry use sense 's going trend market . prediction allow make informative decision 're going drive business . opened gigantic market nvidia . 's really critical , think one computing architecture many critical , critical high contribution personality , call . incredible computer graphic . 's world leader high-performance computing . 're absolutely de facto platform deep learning . we're entering large space data science machine learning well . kind technology industry need . couple industry need . 're complicated industry . life stake . 2 industry think make contribution towards automotive transportation well health care . let talk accelerated computing minute . accelerated computing platform . personality offer . allows people thing never done . past year , built world 's fastest supercomputer . 's united state oak ridge national lab . also helped build japan 's fastest supercomputer europe's fastest supercomputer . instrument breakthrough science . surpassed 1 million developer year . 13 million downloads platform year-to-date . 're seeing 500,000 downloads month . -- platform gaining momentum like never seen . 're allowing people thing n't done . we're reaching scientific community . 're reaching mainstream artificial intelligence community . 're reaching large population enterprise computing machine learning . 's incredible fun think thing we're able could n't . four 5 high-performance computing award year actually combination high-performance computing ai . 's huge paradigm shift going , even 40-year- old application area climate simulation , earthquake simulation . 're biology simulation . year , broke record fastest computation ever achieved . genomic simulation . going create ability u look dataset size make correlation prediction 've never done . simulation computation . data-driven science awesome combination lot math , able thing simulation ca n't always thing real world feasible amount time , 's impossible . artificial intelligence . platform also allowed nvidia thing 've never able . want show video . came computer electronics show . nvidia working self-driving car . 've created platform allows car drive around silicon valley without anyone touching . change lane , change highway . 've created platform application neural network computing stack hardware . infrastructure need build order train car drive . 've done hone skill artificial intelligence . 's incredibly fun . want share video . one thing 'd like look look say drive sim . 're simulation . becomes really diﬃcult really sense reality , real side video simulated . take look . ( presentation ) 're seeing -- car 're seeing left-hand side , 're seeing way 's detecting car creates big space 's living . 's massive amount perception go . , tell difference video real footage simulated ? amazing leverage feel gaming industry . simulation going incredibly powerful industry . certainly allowed u make massive amount progress short amount time . 'm excited health care . think fundamental instrument drive going precision medicine use health care today , amount diversity kind sensor data collect , size data 're collecting time unprecedented . believe health care industry one greatest commander high-performance computing . everything happens 're born genetic makeup . capability continuum life change 're exposed , treated lifetime happening environment around . want able accelerate bring insight phase acquisition datasets . analysis integration work together really forge trail towards personalized medicine . let 's talk little bit nvidia making contribution critical instrument drive compute pipeline precision medicine . data acquisition side , nvidia making contribution sensor . detector continuously improving . 're getting new type detector entering market time , next-gen sequencing , ultrasound , liquid biopsy , course , traditional diagnostic instrument , noble prize-winning cryo-electron microscopy 's allowing u look protein structure could n't look even robotic surgery . instrument start u path able use computing use data data-driven science data-driven health care . want -- -- data ? make analysis eﬃcient ? look amount data that's generated instrument , computing paradigm shift go downstream analysis . finally , integrate data bring true insight prediction accuracy eﬃcacy 's going ? contribution across continuum something nvidia helping industry address . platform embedded directly instrument . year ago , largely used computation . rapidly , people integrating artificial intelligence directly instrument , either make image acquisition -- make faster , make real time . maybe n't need much time acquire data artificial intelligence get back quality need . completely transform 's going acquisition . let 's talk little bit 's happening particular domain health care immense amount progress 're excited . radiology breakthrough year 2018. 70 % research 's going medical imaging based deep learning method . continued massive investment . 'm delighted , artificial intelligence start-up company . $ 2 billion least invested 2018 130 deal . company getting fda approval . company striking deal leader medical imaging . making impact clinical practice . 's , telling radiology society north america , largest radiology conference . , 20,000 radiologist getting trained ai . 's 270 session . last year , -- two year ago , 8 session . leader medical imaging made pretty critical announcement talk acquisition , processing integration . one canon , also toshiba medical . new ai reconstruction algorithm ct. take low-quality image , essentially mean take low-dose image . get back high-resolution imagery artificial intelligence algorithm . 40 frame per second , real time .
