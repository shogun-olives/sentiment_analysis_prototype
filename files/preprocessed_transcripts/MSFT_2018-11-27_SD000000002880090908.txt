'm brad zelnick . 'm software analyst crãƒâ©dit suisse . truly delighted u today jason zander microsoft corporation software keynote morning . jason executive vice president microsoft 's azure business . 's microsoft since 1992 , started engineering . azure , think ran visual studio business . 's correct . question answer really , really excited . n't get comfortable ? format today 's presentation going fireside chat . 're going see learn microsoft 's effort public cloud . jason , maybe open , get note . know wanted ask , microsoft 's mission statement , 's quite bold . every time open filing listen satya speak . 'm reminded empower every person every organization planet achieve . , think boundless opportunity . relates azure , unique azure best enables deliver bold vision ? yes . thank , brad , today well . good morning , everybody . would say several thing would point . want start azure perspective 'd really push hybrid . hybrid something made part product plan since day 1. come fact 20 year experience providing software data center , data center enterprise environment . 've done hyperscale q - brad alan zelnick - jason zandercloud . 's really great solution 've done everything full spread hybrid . also broad portfolio . going even beyond azure , , course , oï¬ƒce 365. think one us , azure-acted directory . identity , security , et cetera . product come together . microsoft cloud , look oï¬ƒce 365 , dynamic identity underpins , thing compose well . last thing would say 's even really technical differentiator . software company . one key thing always tell potential customer partner , 're competition . 're help support world -- think lot customer talk , n't want get technology one hand provider provider turn around compete another . u , core breadth , hybrid , differentiator think resonate . excellent . think global presence , 54 global region , largest presence marketplace understand . think various data center comprise region think driving success , theoretical limit number region expect ? think decision expand different area ? one kind region 've gotten cloud well . mean , 54 region worldwide , big hyperscale region run big workload . order get close possible potential customer well employee . able region around world super important . also region count help u thing like data sovereignty . think history cloud , one key reason need , 're oï¬ƒce 365. 're one first big commercial saas service , popular one today . turn 're people 's e-mail sharepoint document , et cetera , need close need kind coverage . 've done worldwide thing since day 1. think , retailer serving couple market , n't really need . start smaller footprint . search , n't need full coverage . fact , even bing , really 5 region around world run bing . full coverage . 's -- 'm shredding internet searching laugh loud cat , n't need worry one luxembourg , right . basically service way . history kind rooted . 's one way chose differentiate needed . recognized customer isvs worldwide reach needed . theoretical limit , right , 54 region one 've announced . underway n't disclosed yet . expect u continue . point , probably n't need put data center every single location would cost prohibitive . good solution region like european union u.k. brexit thing like well . move thing like azure stack , allow people get last mile . want one basement parliament , hook . q - brad alan zelnick - jason zander q - brad alan zelnick - jason zander helpful . jason , think capex investment , think everybody , many room , look listen carefully microsoft 's allocating capital . specific azure business build-outs , maybe talk little bit capacity planning process ? evolved time ? approach cycle time might different today versus year ago ? yes . let 's look top level . mean , think interesting thing business perspective , tam huge . mean , 's tectonic shift . 26 year microsoft lived do window lived oï¬ƒce created . might biggest one 've seen even kind background . tam actually huge . , question , taking share growing , fantastic . expect capital spend , capex continue rise 're meeting demand . need go . thing remember , build azure , 'm also behalf microsoft property . expand data center , server put , networking connectivity , 're also serving oï¬ƒce 365. we're even serving xbox . mean watch kid come home east coast go west coast see xbox kind pick go homework . drop sudden california , 's . 're supporting kind platform . capital spend u . 's built top , azure 's core . course , customer n't microsoft property running top . expect go . question around eï¬ƒciencies dealing . 're absolutely , every semester , semester planning . book new win cog improvement . includes thing like tidying supply chain , capacity planning , getting better better figuring window long-range positioning kind 101 kind stuff . would say 've grown massively 're also trying grow internal system get eï¬ƒciencies time . 've continued go . 's lot different angle pick apart . rule thumb think $ 1 spend today versus $ 1 five year ago five year productivity would expect get ? yes . . absolutely kind -- real core getting eï¬ƒcient ? answer , absolutely , right . 're absolutely getting eï¬ƒcient go . couple different thing . one , like said , shortening lead time able better job predicting capacity come something concentrate heavily . pretty massive deal . mean , 'd say cloud transitioned . case people would come run risk management , 100,000 core kind run . 're getting largest enterprise replacing entire q - brad alan zelnick - jason zanderdata center . wind huge shift . lot intentional planning getting eï¬ƒciencies . within ï¬‚eet , look combination utilization , power utilization , et cetera . machine learning algorithm run internally optimize stuff . 're making maximum usage . plus lot around sku mix thing like well get best possible planning . 'll even , course , worldwide scale . thing actually part 're eï¬ƒciencies . 'll get better better better time . pivot different topic know everybody 's mind . headline time security . security clearly important design criterion cloud service 's becoming topical part microsoft 's message . matter much spend security , estimate , $ 80 billion , $ 90 billion , $ 100 billion year , continue wake breach . microsoft seeing specific microsoft cloud responsibility ? much opportunity right versus something need inherent platform ? yes . super important one . obviously , security never important , especially even connectivity device around web wind taking even control everyday function interact . think estimate 've seen 2020 , world economy could get hit $ 1 trillion worth impact cybersecurity . wow . okay . need make sure 're , good job . microsoft perspective , spend like $ 1 billion r & . 's professional engineer , men woman working task . 3,500 full-time employee , security . digital crime unit rest kind stuff . 3,500 full-time employee . one interesting thing think security microsoft perspective , see lot unique signal around globe . see , example , everyone using oï¬ƒce 365. produce security technology protect customer product . invest . 1.2 billion socket window , see well . probably seen microsoft publicly work law enforcement agency around world take illegal botnets , phishing site sort bad actor . 's , , part security investment . cloud perspective , think old signal . get 6.5 billion signal day . pull signal see product public net well thing client , botnets rest stuff . include data analytics . run machine learning algorithm . figure bad pattern anti-patterns . 's protect property , oï¬ƒce xbox . turn around make , market question , take tech protect customer make product available customer also advanced protection well . 's -- example thing invest . pointed , mean bar going continue go . q - brad alan zelnick - jason zander q - brad alan zelnick term monetizing investment , expect increasingly 'll see going security dollar earmarked within customer budget versus monetizing adoption customer feeling confident oï¬ƒce 365 azure various cloud service offer ? implicit versus explicit , sorry . sure . , absolutely . yes . think think , time , we'll continue evolve . way , security table stake , right . security cloud . . 's going built . see kind re-factoring kind value proposition cloud brings . mean 're longer worrying hardware , 're longer worrying underlying management , come . course , certain element security come . 's table stake part . provide well . default protection , 's got . people take advantage . would something , point , would recognized people leveraging infrastructure-as-a-service as- a-service offering database paas . 's core part built . said , today , 're protecting -- cio looking portfolio 's running data center , chance 's actually leveraging 12 separate product lot vendor , stitching bunch stuff together trying figure go make stuff work . 're paying product . certain amount value waterfall 's part cloud provides . lot advanced threat analytics that's available . expect people want able . strategy twofold . one , 'll see u introduce product . mentioned azure security center , 's also -- oï¬ƒce threat analyzer well o365 . 's bunch technology expect customer want value help protect , case , simplify portfolio mentioned . also strong isv ecosystem . 12 product cio using data center , turn hybrid state expect see hybrid across board , want make sure 're meeting also working isvs bring product along well . think see u core table stake . differentiated offering think simplify world really good job managing . 're also going healthy ecosystem help everybody bridge gap . isvs , also modernize product . excellent . thank . much . opener , jason , talked hybrid distinct attribute differentiator offering . also think intelligent cloud , 's often talked context well intelligent edge . many talk edge computing next generation growth opportunity technology , broadly . think edge , going various player . going horizontal winner . going specific specialized edge player like security edge player , et cetera . 've heard satya way rest organization , - jason zanderexamples like precision agriculture , precision medicine . talk bit edge opportunity see today ? important ? microsoft well positioned capture ? yes . 's great one . 'll see world view microsoft . 've used framing last couple year , actually . think captured quite well . took world view intelligent cloud intelligent edge . ? think one thing need cloud back end really kind substrate . mean know matter device 'm using , 's phone tablet car . mean cloud help , give u global reach , maximum processing power . edge , point , different sort form factor available . could anything , , device 're carrying , stuff table bag , thing like sensor running building . mean thing part edge . intelligent piece come -- believe smart . mean ca n't bunch signal coming dumb device . 'll sensor measure . thing . also want smart edge . favorite example , think self- driving car , like 's point want enough smart board car see red bouncing ball come front , hit brake right away , like would driver 's high probability 's kid coming right behind . like , n't want making round-trip cloud figure , hit brake ? okay ? mean , like , . mean , like , right right . think intelligence piece something that's super important . 's topical taxonomy . let 's mention kind hybrid aspect think play maybe come back edge , 's okay . hybrid perspective , mean ? mean 're going , , think edge taxonomy . going hybrid kind solution , , part solution since day 1. think hybrid super important , 's identity , 's data , 's security 's also form factor . 's run couple software application , 's got thing put together . that's core part 've done . hybrid offering actually really , really strong . , come 20 year experience actually done software data center 're structurally positioned quite well matter mix look like customer . particular , tell one really great example . seeing -- single azure hybrid benefit . mean take sa license window server sql server , run premise . also bring azure cloud . azure cloud . look pricing perspective , mean running workload sa , amazon could 5x expensive workload , right . 'm seeing really good dynamic market , 's lot people server workload might running sql server , 're 2008 product line . coming end service . lot conversation customer right , well , modernize ? like upgrade place existing equipment ? also data center migration . come along give azure hybrid benefit , help actually pull tech forward , actually run ï¬‚exibly much , much cheaper . 'm seeing whole bunch company q - brad alan zelnick - jason zanderare starting zero , gosh , maybe great time move workload , get modernized latest version , kind get evergreen solution plus cloud saving , great combination . example . azure stack side . let stop hybrid want get back edge question . please . okay . edge -- 's basis . wanted go hit see line . background , okay . 've got combination cloud , 've got hybrid component run data center , get thing like azure stack , , third- generation appliance 've actually done . joined azure 2012 already part strategy back since day 1. start getting edge thing . let 's take great example , like connected factory . 's one favorite think factory , 's running . stopping production line factory could cost $ 1 million minute hour , depending 're . could really , really expensive able . like let 's get iot scenario . come back onto edge , combination controller thing ï¬‚oor , hooked . put azure stack shop ï¬‚oor , make sure everything nice connected . even 's fiber connection , massive storm , hurricane , n't know , something like , factory keep running . intelligent edge part , 'm also lot ai machine learning locally , 've actually got people production manufacturing . jabil good example . put camera production line . actually take picture component go different manufacturing stage use ml model actually look look like n't . image recognition . 'll actually ï¬‚ag defect early fix line go . 's great example intelligent edge right . get azure stack component . thing come together . course , machine , thing running factory , upload log public cloud , hyperscale cloud , cheap storage , lot compute start running big analytics job tune production run . like worse manufacturing germany , middle december , 's cold five day row . depends upon factory material . make decision tune . put stuff together , believe really awesome solution . dovetail quite well . 's part strategy since day 1. mentioned industrial one absolutely lead industrial iot azure iot . 've got 70 major partner look thing like schneider johnson ge siemens rest folk part house . also company , mentioned jabil , cummins even coffee maker stuff like , factory . 's kind like world view . applied smart city smart building smart everything . kind light . sound like possibility become endless . 's really cool . love . q - brad alan zelnick - jason zander come together . appreciate consistency azure stack seamless experience relates azure cloud customer benefit get azure hybrid benefit , come together enables customer adopt architecture 's best based requirement constraint , know every investor room whoever 's listening made bet rate pace cloud migration look like . look back 3 , five year , 10 year road , much enterprise estate `` on- premise '' versus `` cloud '' however define ? 'd curious , data look , experience , world view -- mean saw ibm make massive acquisition red hat . one justification , hey , 20 % enterprise today life public cloud , thought ? yes . one -- mentioned hybrid taxonomy , like actually view , since day 1 , persistent hybrid state . 've never viewed snap finger number , 're -- everybody 's hyperscale cloud . fact , factory example gave , smart city critical infrastructure , that's example . 're always going hybrid mode . 've always anticipated expected , would , 's 's strategy since day 1 've made investment . perspective , 're going help customer meet whatever demand look like . think 's place 'm seeing people really looking hyperscale cloud great way go run workload . 're seeing cost saving , 's hybrid benefit mentioned , keeping up-to-date , able actually save money , thing absolutely driving growth hyperscale piece . on-premises side , like mentioned way sometimes sovereignty disconnected scenario , thing , 're absolutely going want run thing way . good news . think evaluating product portfolio 're operating , 're structurally set well . 've on-prem stuff 20 year . lot world 's workload run software . fact asset parlayed part strategy cloud symmetry really set u -- we're first-class thing . mentioned & activity , way , i'm seeing lot folk , frankly , lot hybrid washing originally slide . really meant put workload data center 're happy . 's title say hybrid . really hybrid . i'm starting see -- validation actually back strategy move 've made . think 're seeing lot market people trying get back started hybrid . case , vendor never actually made hyperscale public cloud . case , hyperscale cloud company going partnership try figure , '' well okay , great . backtrack get stuff onboard ? '' 'll see coming . way view validation strategy 've since day 1. respect ibm red hat , last comment made , would tell 've got really good relationship red hat . 's going really well . 've got great adoption rhel enterprise linux . actually created q - brad alan zelnick - jason zander q - brad alan zelnick - jason zanderdifferentiated support solution red hat . red hat engineer microsoft site . customer call , issue , 're going talk u . n't get phone tagged . 's unique thing we've red hat . ton mutual customer 're going keep supporting customer . frankly , perspective , news n't really change . 're going keep momentum . 're going keep supporting customer . topic , microsoft embraced open architecture last several year way 5 , six year ago , think , nobody could imagined . critical strategy ? yes . 's -- . hopefully , people seeing kind cultural transformation microsoft . 's kind attitude , work partner . way , think , benefit couple decade company kind maturation 've wisdom kind gained , hope . hope people see . would say part , also , want make sure open source perspective , going meet customer live 're absolutely using open source . 's important . want make sure 've got first-class solution . . higher run rate linux creates virtual machine public cloud . 's massive . mean 're going support thing like operating system . also middleware , developer stack , devop tool , part stack need . 're also -- surprise people sometimes , 're also huge contributor open source . fact , 's 16,000 full-time microsoft engineer contribute github . 's actually highest corporation . see . 've actually really embraced . we're supporting entire thing . , think 's really customer choice that's enabling . really , end day , platform 're go towards cloud . want make sure workload run top . 're topic -- thanks , jason . relationship 've embracing red hat open source linux , specific ibm deal , thought term impact may may way think red hat going forward ibm company ? yes . say , huge overlap , believe , customer . really drove u deeper relationship red hat , look historically , maybe n't deep relationship last year . 's actually really great . 've really good program . given mutual customer , 're absolutely going continue support customer . believe red hat going want able q - brad alan zelnick - jason zander q - brad alan zelnicksame thing . reason able make sure , happens . far 're concerned , mean 're full steam ahead part partnership . thing change time , 'll reevaluate . right , want customer know -- mutual customer know , we're absolutely full steam going support . excellent . pivot , slightly different question . kpis , metric use run business . see externally , key measure success azure business inside microsoft ? yes . 've got ton . 's would say , number one thing want look customer happy platform experiencing . one first thing would measure business perspective consumed revenue . think cloud service , 're interested people actually using , meter spinning 're solving problem . 'll absolutely look consumed revenue . stat publish . saw 76 % growth q1 azure revenue growth come . 's example . , 's recognized people using , kind commit . 's number one also measure one internally . look internal side , 'll also look combination , making customer happy platform . 've got existing customer , usage starting increase would mean sign healthy customer relationship 're moving workload , 're finding value platform . want make sure , go . 're also going track , business perspective , mix service people use . get cloud journey , 're able take advantage service , database service platform service , usage increasing 's also good sign healthy thing . , internally , owning product well . 's one super interesting . measure satisfaction . 'm , customer obsessed . want make sure 're happy . look net promoter score make sure customer , like would recommend friend ? yes . 's thing kind client side . thing commercial . want make sure thing going quite well well . course , metric would look net customer addition . i've got healthy customer 're growing mix healthy , actually adding new customer well ? sort thing track internally . wo n't even get perf stress whole bunch engineering stuff 's like 2 inch deck . month entire division . 's lot fun . call fundamental . always say put fun fun day . engineer love . 's great . anyway , business perspective , audience , topical one one think relevant . excellent . think measuring customer success , satisfaction think context element offering 've actually - jason zandergone ahead adopted , 've got premium service , data service , 've talked little bit iot lower level , 've got infrastructure . maybe talk little bit adoption pattern economics customer go way graduate nirvana layer 7 , however think world . economics customer , stickiness relationship think various adoption curve . layer 7 networking dev background showing . okay , see . software engineer recognize one . mean -- obviously , 're going meet customer exactly . infrastructure , want come , want get hardware , compute networking storage , absolutely support . like as-a-service thing 've got , database service , paas , azure iot , medium . also ai ml . prebuilt service facial recognition speech text kind stuff . thing actually take away lot tacs otherwise use business get thing going . think benefit one get , like take data solution , great . thing like automatic backup point-in-time recovery , like make sure thing work . keep patched up-to-date . thing cost today 're probably spending lot personnel time actually making sure go . service , get benefit . get le kind toil come actually get . 's good value find customer move higher-level service actually save money , 're all-up perspective . 's good . business -- 're evaluating business , course , service structurally higher margin 're also stickier . mean hope 's win- win . customer get better solution actually save money way operate overall estate actually take saving apply new thing . business perspective , since 're looking microsoft , , structurally higher margin , kind stickier environment , happier customer , , nsat , et cetera , thing kind come together . couple great example one , sql-managed instance , awesome example . take sql server including 2019 , latest version , bunch big data tech built . run premise . sql-managed instance allows take apps move public cloud . land thing , 'll take care toil , backup patching kind stuff happens . great example . also , there's end-of-life service support , fantastic impetus people make move . also thing like cosmos db . worldwide nosql database , first kind . today , 's actually lot work engineer go set . say want run something 3 continent , 've got lot work make sure data get replicated around world fast keep customer running . cosmos db , go portal , create cosmos db , start writing data . . unique , differentiated , first-to-market kind solution , great example . analytics side , sql dw g2 , cheaper faster redshift , great solution well , wrapped ai stack . 's kind think structure come 's lot really , really nice product offering . q - brad alan zelnick - jason zander q - brad alan zelnick - jason zander q - brad alan zelnick related question . think , measured win rate insight data customer , success microsoft historical microsoft-centric customer running ton sql server data center versus oracle whatever alternative might versus non-microsoft-centric versus greenfield-type cloud prospect , commentary term success mix ? -- would seem naturally microsoft-centric account easier kind welcome door . commentary along line ? -- -- thank , 's good thing point . support platform vendor mentioned , even something compete category like relational database . -- customer , clear , n't use lick microsoft software except azure . 're 100 % linux . 're 100 % java they're using mysql postgresql . using oracle . 's 100 % non-microsoft stack . thing 're using cloud . like mentioned , run rate linux virtual machine actually higher window server machine coming . absolutely support . healthy mix . 'm excited 're always -- would n't want people think u microsoft stack cloud . 's actually . support everything . think healthy run rate mix proved . top , point , fact actually create software 's lot company , high percentage company running microsoft server running sql server well , make u natural home . awesome third-party support , open source support also natural home microsoft workload , think great balance . vertical perspective well , imagine obvious synergy area opportunity , retail , example , one , right ? absolutely . retail really good one , actually . mentioned , think lot customer , n't want go spend money get technology provider turn around us money compete . 're actually seeing lot company . vertical start seeing covered -- competition , become competition people 're otherwise serving . see inquiry come . vertical absolutely . finished black friday cyber monday . really , really major company work , asos u.k. , walmart , jet.com , whole set big retailer fantastic kind holiday shopping season went , another great example . 's lot fin sector , manufacturing energy , take pick . - jason zander q - brad alan zelnick - jason zanderawesome . term supply chain , think infrastructure sourcing , talk little bit decision get made design specific chipset whatever component might , 's philosophy behind choosing versus b ? yes , great question . 's kind 2 angle think . first one supply chain 101 , capacity management 101. mean anybody , done mba , done kind work , mean , make sure 're absolutely great . 've massive , massive scale really , really fast . keep building system . big scale business . something get shelf component go run . 're also building system . nice advantage hyperscale cloud build software capacity supply chain work . actually work well control fabric run ï¬‚eet , mean get signal immediately kind come together integrated way . vendor perspective , normal kind hygiene , pick multiple vendor . make sure 're good job sourcing perspective . 've also open source project . project called sonic , basically -- 's networking thing contributed back . ran top switch . pay high premium switching inside data center sonic . open sourced . made available . run equipment . example software side reduce cost 'm going pay high margin . frankly , 'd never data center . 'd cost prohibitive . 're running scale , . hardware perspective , also partner lot hardware manufacturer . buy - - 's enough scale . buy 1 million something , get discount . also probably inï¬‚uence design . 'd actually . also custom hardware well . thing like we've deployed fpgas across ï¬‚eet networking . actually -- whole silicon design team , 's virtually . design hardware . design silicon . happens group also thing like hololens surface . actually rest . team also work data center figure , okay , silicon improvement put data center well . . talk little bit advantage using fpgas going deep design ? yes . fpga really , really cool . mean field programmable gate array . really mean hard burned silicon , fastest kind performance , software top , probably little bit slower . fpgas right . kind come top . key thing give ï¬‚exibility . actually go additional tweak . get hardware-level speed , fast burnt silicon . next notch . leverage networking . get 100-gigabit connectivity virtual machine continue improve . q - brad alan zelnick - jason zander q - brad alan zelnick - jason zandercan also leverage thing like ai . example , brainwave project leverage fpgas really awesome job thing like image recognition , fantastic . go make go . course , silicon design perspective , algorithm run fpgas get hardened , turn around silicon team turn custom silicon , custom asics . 'll actually load ï¬‚eet actually make real estate available chip next set algorithm next set win . awesome . way , recently read effort looking building subsea data center . n't intuitive . would assume 's lot le expensive build data center top solid ground terra firma . advantage see ? science project ? going wake one day everybody 's going data center spongebob underneath sea ? pool backyard boat drink . yes . . think -- particular project , project natick code name . research project clear . microsoft research folk pulling back together . really done 've taken actual data center put water , like literally , like coast scotland recent one guy dropped . couple different thing , , one , 50 % world's population actually life near water . mean actually near coastal line sort , mean access city , put data compute capacity , , close . also , course , natural insulation potentially perpetual energy wave everything like . also give u experience lights-out perspective . example , clear , n't actually go greenlight johnny quest scuba gear go fix hard drive . n't . 's lights-out kind opportunity figure run hardware minimal amount touch . fact 's , one touch 's done decommissioned . think think , essentially , production terra firma near-cheap energy stable ground everything else . massive 2-square-mile site build , even experience gain help u better job operationalizing ï¬‚eet really great thing . start innovation , 're starting find , even dovetail stuff around quantum computing thing well . knowledge gain actually quite interesting . jason , disappointment n't time got zillion question ask . , thank immensely . tremendously insightful , really appreciate time c technology conference . q - brad alan zelnick - jason zanderthank . much . appreciate . 're welcome . thank , everybody .
