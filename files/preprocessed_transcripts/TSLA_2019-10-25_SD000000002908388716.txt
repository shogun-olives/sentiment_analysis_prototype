hi . elon . welcome tesla solar glass unveil , . 'll -- 'll , brief introduction go question . intent behind sort solar glass roof make roof come alive , live roof instead dead roof . roof gathering sunlight anything . intent convert sunlight energy . think future , odd roof dormant dead gather energy . ask , future want ? future think want , well u , future look around neighborhood roof gathering energy , 're something useful 're -- look beautiful . 're robust resilient . 're powering house shelter . think 'll want , say , actually , 20 year , look around neighborhood . 's . solar glass roof going make financial sense somebody relatively new roof , , roof integrated solar power generation . 's -- , therefore , cost roofing house addition cost solar panel solar cell . however , 've able achieve version 3 cost -- price point le average roof cost plus solar panel . 're looking 2 option , one need roof either need new roof need reroof house . -- look cost , average cost cost adding solar panel roof versus cost tesla solar glass , integrated roof plus solar panel solar cell , solar glass roof cost le . best knowledge accurate . 'll obviously see , debuted , whether correct . mean 's going correct everywhere going time 's cheap roof cheap solar panel . 's maybe corner case 's cheaper . think maybe 80 % time , tesla solar glass roof make economic sense look best longest lasting . 's intent . 's quite hard get point . -- quite diﬃcult product , roof last long time . add electrification roof , 's obviously fair bit complexity wire need make sure 's going safe cause risk house . also last many decade . mean want last something order 30 year . 's -- 's easy accelerated live testing want say , okay , well , -- course , say , six month try accelerate life roof know like 30 year . quite hard . system extremely robust . figuring install effectively non-trivial . 're actually going like install -- kind install-athons , , 've got -- fremont factory , 2 house identical . 2 competing team . install solar glass roof eﬃciently . 're going try get like best roofing team country also give shot . 's tesla internal . actually , say solar glass roof , going start tesla installers , something intend open roofing contractor general . unlike vehicle sale , go tesla store online . that's sort -- n't want get trapped like franchise law 's lot complexity automotive distribution kind break precedent , 's highly problematic potentially many place . tesla solar glass roof , think 's different situation . -- like local sale monopoly . 's -- 's highly competitive market . think 's going make sense , therefore , like tesla certified installers who's going install solar glass roof . think powerful driver demand allow u grow much faster could otherwise grow . operator - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglinoand going produced giga new york , factory buffalo , people working really hard . 'd like say , appreciation team . 've really putting pretty huge effort ramp production solar glass roof . 's -- pretty impressed visited earlier year . -- like , okay , seems like lot -- ton people . seems like good situation . think 'll definitely make proud , factory look 's going great . yes . think like -- 's really cool product . well like said , nutshell , getting new roof -- 're reroofing getting new roof , feel like -- feel quite confident smart move . -- -- already -- roof already new , smart move financially . may still want . 's going financially punitive existing roof still long way go . -- -- existing roof lot -- lot life left , would recommend tesla solar panel , like -- get -- solar retrofit call . 's right move roof still , like , say , 10 year life . tesla solar glass 's new roof reroofing . right . , 'll move , like , question -- 'll repeat question try best answer . question answer thank . start call up-voted question related solar roof retail investor say.com . justin asks , change tesla implemented v1 v2 v3 ? impact cost performance ? mean , 's quite change . also drew kunal . guy , want sort answer change 've made . 's lot . yes . mean , really wanted achieve goal 'm -- 'll let . involves assessing cost , beauty , installability , manufacturability across ax . 've -- run key point . 've increased size tile , increased power density tile , dramatically reduced number part subassemblies tile half . go direction lower cost easier manufacturability . also changed material use , changed method 're using -- technology 're using achieve hidden solar cell something 's scalable . - - - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino say , like , one hardest thing , say , solar glass roof seeing solar cell beneath glass would -- 's kind off- putting see cell . hard part want -- photon sun get solar cell . create something aesthetically unappealing . 's quite hard challenge . yes . solar cell optically isotropic , meaning look purple one angle green another . , number different iteration technology experiment , landed technology get solar tile point 're anisotropic . blend surrounding nonsolar tile trim . look angle . exactly . thing -- let view helicopter . may look weird 're helicopter . even , still look damn good . key aspect focusing installation . really wanted achieve installation time faster new roof plus traditional panel . well fact , 're trying improve even installation time roof . yes . think right tooling equipment especially paying close attention edge effect multiple plane roof meet , think add apply world 's best engineering . think actually solar glass roof installed faster comp shingle , -- 's -- like 's target . - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - kunal girotra - elon r. musk - kunal girotra - elon r. muskthat 's clear goal . yes . 're definitely moving quickly . 're coming , comp shingle . installs part ambition achieve . key part installability looking part get factory field roof come together roof . lot iteration . final thing would mention ﬂashings , sort like -- edge trim -- trimming roof , would say , early version product , almost like custom handicraft . 've done thought lot problem come beautiful solution achievable field . yes . totally . kunal . installers working hard installing . already seen , much simpler , faster lot intuitive install . thing guy said led really fast install time . we're targeting even faster comp shingle . yes . yes . think 'm comfortable 'll get , actually . yes . 's quite bit r & installation process . difference simple tool , one way , dramatically affect install cost time . 's also important , like , least amount bother . like , 's hard house new roof put . occur within 8-hour -- like basically entire roof 8 hour quite important literally come back -- go work , come back 've got new roof 's generating electricity . well 's target , 8-hour roof . see done roofing company . yes . yes . kind like roofing company going sort install roof . - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk operator - elon r. musk operator - elon r. musk yes . even building . building , yes . yes . -- alexander asks , expect solar roof v3 available wide residential adoption ? yes . 's actually . yes . simply go website enter address place order right . -- 'll installation , ramping fast possibly , starting next week , actually . think , actually , underway right . yes , mean goal actually get north 1,000 roof per week quickly possible . 's always hard predict early stage production ramp thing move fast slowest item . -- think next several month , well past 1,000 roof week . think 's goal . robert asks , current solar roof production capacity ? think production ramp 2020 ? feeling demand ? well n't think 're really going much demand problem , honest . think demand far excess supply . always , 's diﬃcult predict supply -- production ramp almost always look like s-curve . start slow first number constraint . could trivial part 's limiting production ramp . still limit production ramp 's missing even simplest item one little thing taking longer expected , set total production rate . 's -- mean , 's essentially impossible predict accuracy fast-moving part production s-curve . , think , predict s-curve start ﬂatten , 's like much predictable . 's think say , like , probably several month , able 1,000 roof week ? think answer yes . long term , want obviously like 10,000 roof week 20,000 roof week . 's -- think , like , addressable market something order 100 million house worldwide . 's -- obviously want ramp quickly possible . 're starting kind textured black glass . hopefully , 'll able bring operator - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk - kunal girotra - elon r. muskvolume production variance solar glass roof , n't know , every 6 nine month , something like . one challenging -- achieving good sort earth tone solar glass roof , meaning like clay tile type thing . doable . 's harder achieve right look . 's something maybe order year away , something like . yes . 'll see . john asks , tesla handle logistics installation ? already partnership installation company ? n't plan yet installation company . current plan -- announced broad brush stroke internal installation crew . feel like 're hitting kind ﬂat positive part learning curve bring outside roofing company installers . say , okay , 're -- help u make better ? think 'll see rapid improvement solar roof installation timing . -- like said , version 3 really -- like first version think -- ramped scale . often true new technology , like window 1 2 n't -- n't really work , frankly . window 3 first big one . sort like 3.1 something . yes , know 3.1. true . 's old school . 3.1. 0.1 release . sort 0.1 -- 3 minus 1 , really giant bug . think 's true . -- think like version 2 -- hopefully , would 3.1 case 're going keep improving roof scale . 're hiring lot installers . yes . 're hiring lot installers , yes . - kunal girotra - elon r. musk operator - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk operator q - kyle field - elon r. muskas well 'll partnering installation company week come . lot action deploying product . yes . -- john say.com , buffalo manufacture solar ? plan add cell production manufacture powerwall/packs well giga 1 focus vehicle cell ? sure . yes . giga 2 already producing solar . supercharger actually manufactured today , along inverter powerpack power electronics upcoming megapack . yes , 's real center excellence power electronics , couple well solar think 's frequently coupled solar . yes . regarding beyond solar roof solar power electronics , plan moment . 's really primarily solar glass roof . 's buffalo factory focus . consumption worldwide . 're going start u.s. 's need tight feedback loop . issue , fix rapidly scale . already something provide worldwide . first question phone line come kyle field clean technician . 's kyle cleantechnica . cost solar roof big barrier to-date version 2. speak little bit relative improvement cost version 2 version 3 solar glass roof ? q - kyle field - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino q - kyle field - elon r. musk - kunal girotrayes . 're right . mean version 2 -- expensive . n't -- 's like 're making ton money , 're basically trying lose money . n't version worth scaling 's expensive . -- think version 3 something think get cost average roof plus retrofit solar panel feel pretty good cost structure . 's -- 's worth going big time version . okay . actually -- sorry , also say , like , one thing 's obviously delayed tesla solar general focus -- 18 24 month , focus entire company model 3 -- model 3 production ramp . really -- kind stripped resource solar 1.5 year thereabouts . -- make model 3 work tesla would n't exist . model 3 relatively smooth operation , 've able redirect resource towards solar stationary storage . 's true . . make sense . actually , version 2 solar roof house installation process look like kind lego version building death star roof . talk little bit guy done streamline process , feel like major barrier cost speed installation . sure . yes , talk installation improvement . mean one big thing drew elon touched upon installed v2 2 roofing plane met roof plane edge , call edge condition , like cut tile v2 . cumbersome process . took lot time , created lot wastage on-site , needed extra tool . 've gotten rid v3 . 's big , major improvement . total number material part reduction v2 v3 massively reduced number touch installers on-site . reduces time take install . - elon r. musk operator q - phil lebeau - elon r. musk q - phil lebeau - kunal girotra operatorso 's ton timing improvement like made across product make installs really fast . 's advantage tesla vertically integrated chain -- team engineer installers working day night test home giving rapid iterative feedback improve minor installation eﬃciencies . 'll lot . edge condition -- basically nightmare version 2. quite artisanal . like artisanal glass factory , lot like final production actually house . 's sort like 're building airplane finish production runway . great . next question come phil lebeau cnbc . elon , quick question installation crew . give u sense many crew currently ? 's staﬃng per crew ? 3 people ? 4 people ? primarily based california right ? give u kind geographic sense . well 'm sure 's -- like , 're really trying product-focused . think current , like , number crew -- 'm sure , that's particularly helpful end customer . like really meant call explaining product consumer opposed sort finance call something like . well 'm looking finance . 'm trying get sense guy talking wanting ramp . 're trying get sense ability right term , hi . 're planning 2,000 crew , 3,000 crew . what's capacity like ? let 's put way . installed tesla solar 25 state country . 'll definitely installing solar roof state already energy warehouse 'll installing solar roof well . elon said , 'll expanding across country crew well third-party crew . 's say right . 25 state installing solar . solar roof state well . q - sean o'kane - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk operator q - kimberly javaheriour next question come sean o'kane verge . sound like little bit -- simplified stuff make little easier install new version . 's maybe little bit going tile . -- tell sort process went make sure n't run sort production issue previous version ? yes . think -- like issue prior version much production . installation problematic . could ramped production version 2. 's -- would run fundamental obstacle diﬃculty installation . 're wondering like run diﬃculty ramping version 3 ? absolutely . like ton -- massive amount diﬃculty , 'd go ton pain . , like , step back . want clear . applied preventative measure , however , reducing number part subassemblies half . 've dramatically reduced number processing step manufacturing step , simplifies manufacturing ramp . say early production right gone smoothly . ramp s-curve , find thing overcome . early production look good far . yes . 's always quite sort jumpy thorny sort short-term basis . think year , pretty smooth sailing . like said , actually feel like 'll get folk short term . think understand like product going go long term , go say , want world -- want world look like ? 's like , want future look around house neighborhood 're generating electricity 're beautiful they're long-lasting ? course . 's future need make happen . next question come kim javaheri youtube channel , like tesla . - elon r. musk - kunal girotra - elon r. musk - kunal girotra - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk - kunal girotrai 'm curious could elaborate little warranty like tile ? 're using third-party roofer affect warranty ? yes , sure , kunal . yes . version , offering 25-year warranty , weatherization , power . 130 mile per hour wind resistance , hail resistance . 25 year warranty right . yes . mean , thing fairly standard roofing industry . -- , 's derivative . yes . yes . definitely n't answer right . -- 's kind like -- frankly , 's kind like weird sort odd product . like , -- really care . 's like , would anyone make solar roof , strange . thing . 're going make . yes . 's going real confusing 's like actual product like . 's nature product . one comment -- like third-party installers , warranty work . mean , roofing work today , right ? 's like manufacturer tile asphalt shingle square . certified installer roofer trained audited install correctly , eventually warranty extended installer . would n't expect u anything different product . 's quite big market roof , actually . mean order 100 million roof north america . get replaced every 25 year . set like maybe 4 million roof year . 4 million roof . - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk operator q - roberto baldwin - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino 5 million new home year . mean , sorry , 1 million new home . yes . 1 million new home year . like order 5 million north america . 're 5 % world 's population thereabouts . 's quite big market . think 're going production sort installation constrained . 's going -- mean percentage basis , grow like kelp steroid . 's like many thing sorted . think going exciting product . 's like kind thing think people want -- want roof way . yes . next question come roberto baldwin engadget . 'm curious energy eﬃciency tile virtually panel . , let's say , 200 square foot area tile 200 square foot area panel , like difference sunlight-to-energy conversion ? sure . 's slight impact . well target equivalent better . benefit solar roof smaller , like , integer size . think -- granularity -- basically put question like 's cell eﬃciency . 're purely looking cell eﬃciency basis , 'll always going take knockdown order better aesthetic . knockdown , want keep knockdown something order maybe 10 % -ish . hopefully , le . drew like saying le . like best case -- like , ideally , 's like single-digit effect energy eﬃciency cell level . put far cell roof without affecting aesthetic . fact , ca n't even tell one active . one panel -- panel active , one active . total power generated roof significantly greater solar glass roof . yes . n't ever solar , mean , drive around neighborhood look home . see quantization problem panel . like , 've got skylight , 've got stove pipe restoration . - elon r. musk - kunal girotra - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino operator q - darrell etherington roof messy complicated . way , generally , look terrible . normally n't pay attention roof . normally n't pay attention roof . 're like , wow . lot trouble finding good-looking roof . like want best- looking roof 's easy finding picture good roof . let tell , 's diﬃcult . also giant part task . reason , equivalent better -- better almost case , power generation . consumer standpoint , better outcome -- right move going get new roof solar panel , solar glass roof integrated cell , 's maybe better outcome , believe , home term economics , power generation , aesthetic . durable . yes . want add one comment . 're married particular solar cell technology aesthetic solution . solar cell get better , -- solar roof also get better . important target team make sure 'd let -- stick legacy source technology increase energy solar . although solar eﬃciency quite plateaued . yes . yes . next question come darrell etherington techcrunch . wondering , see potential format incarnation technology might enter market different way offered consumer different way ? - elon r. musk operator q - hope king - elon r. musk q - hope king - elon r. musk yes . 're really scaling one variant , kind like textured black glass look . -- , time , want -- like roof sort earth tone , like sort like clay tile . want one look like french slate . house like black textured glass . -- especially 's sort mediterranean architecture , 's going look place . making work next agenda product development standpoint term significant improvement significant , say , variant , improvement . 's like we're getting earth tone version look right next major challenge ensuring team . think 'll get time probably next year . next question come hope king cheddar . consumer standpoint , especially 've seen happen california , mean pg & e say could take another 10 year outage - - ratcheted significantly . elon , 've tweeting recently get folk order tesla solar powerwall . already seeing order grow , demand grow result outage ? yes . think seeing demand growth result , yes . 's reason turn light people , n't want keep happening next 10 year . -- 's obvious solution . -- 're sort sitting dark device battery powered , lose phone connection , 's like security risk . mean can't even call 911. 's like 's problem . 're definitely seeing people interested solar plus powerwall battery . blackout renewable energy . yes , 's definitely 're seeing demand increase result . think 'll continue see future . important also developing overall tesla energy ecosystem guy want build ? yes . think important . fundamental goal tesla accelerate advent sustainable energy . , therefore , generate energy sustainable way . -- really mean solar primarily , view . that's solar residential level , commercial level utility level . -- since sun obviously n't shine night . operator q - karissa bell - elon r. musk q - karissa bell - elon r. muskand like cloudy weather time , storage continuous power . 's really 3 part sustainable energy future . 's , tesla standpoint , solar power generation , storing solar stationary storage powerwall power pack megapack consuming energy sustainable way , mean electric transport . think fundamental good tesla , view , degree accelerate advent sustainable energy future . next question come karissa bell mashable . 've talked lot kind 're improving installation process , making eﬃcient , lot faster . 'm wondering kind talk little bit sort 're anticipating wait time like people make reservation preorder . kind long 're anticipating 'll wait 'll actually able get installed . well depends many people sign solar glass roof . lot people , depend -- 'll sort queue thing accordingly . know , might month 'll wait several month . think sooner people sign , le time 'll wait . grow exponentially . n't know , might like doubling every month something like . want get point next year 's short wait time , 's possible . 'll best achieve . anticipate -- anticipate installation process help speed thing overall , like much eﬃcient end-to-end reservation installation version 1 2 ? yes . really intended easy install . continue improvement make version 3 actually mostly related edge condition , like , essentially corner roof plane roof meet edge roof rain gutter kind thing . rapid evolution edge condition detail . 's , think , key growing rapidly like said , getting install time typical roof 8 hour , mean really think 's better basically fairly big crew attack roof , kind like surgical strike . get done quickly versus small number people take long time roof minimizes -- done fast minimizes inconvenience homeowner . - andrew d. baglino - kunal girotra - elon r. musk - kunal girotra - elon r. musk - andrew d. baglino - kunal girotra - elon r. musk operator 's le setup , tear time every day . fewer truck roll -- totally . yes . 'll installing starting next month california . -- already customer lined . one comment wait time . 're actually employing -- wait time , one thing consider weather . place 's like buried covered snow , like , obviously , 's wait time . -- rainy ultimately . yes . mean , guess , intention , roof , want install faster traditional roof installed . benchmark calling somebody saying want new roof getting roof installed like soon weather good , 's exactly product work . yes . 's like seamless easy wait long time . right , cool , think 's probably last question . thanks , everyone , joining . look forward -- look forward installing , ultimately , million roof . thanks . thank , lady gentleman . concludes today 's conference call .
