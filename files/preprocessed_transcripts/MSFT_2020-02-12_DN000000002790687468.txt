's target market m365 ? course strength microsoft always , would say . go segment view put u enterprise . 's really nice microsoft 365 bringing component together , expanded target market . let talk couple perspective . first , look enterprise , combination component allows u , speak , really speak business business transformation 's -- really changed sale motion . think 'll talk little bit later . second thing microsoft 365 allowed , 's allowed u go even enterprise new area , example , first line worker people largely n't access kind productivity software , previously . allowed u go market smb 're able bring service together integrated way take-out lot management department previously . 's microsoft 365 package allowed u lot thing n't able on-premise software way delivered value . , see enterprise rightly pointed certain pocket , go outside knowledge worker people may never access oﬃce may n't even window machine using . kind enabled people kind get employee base microsoft 's suite offering . , company , kind pick choose , okay , might e5 , might e3 might skus . much mixing matching going result ? quite bit mixing matching maybe best example would kind talk look like large enterprise . , take step back look large enterprise 're , course , information worker 're trying help productive thing think u would familiar . people carry laptop , access computing power laptop go cloud . heather bellini jared spataro heather bellinifor lot worker 're , high value worker . call first line worker . may kind every day carry type computing device , increasingly carry phone , kind left behind technology revolution focused productivity . healthcare sector example , great customer st. luke 's regional health care network 've profile recently doctor , first line worker . highly qualified highly paid individual , 're able use microsoft 365 deliver value phone , way really help productive . like say microsoft 365 license people depending need , connect everyone top ﬂoor shop ﬂoor , word , connect everyone across organization . think microsoft 365 first platform really allows u productivity sense spanning different worker type . getting licensing question specifically , certainly see people license really based need worker . 'd license e3 e5 information worker . license called first line license 'll use first line worker . depends need individual worker level . enterprise customer used getting new machine getting window 10 maybe new machine either using oﬃce 365 increasingly using oﬃce 365 like much cultural change enterprise customer move away kind used adopt window technology past even oﬃce technology -- like start morphing type strategy ? 's big change . underestimate . , thing 're tapping microsoft 365 business transformation general . think customer sometimes n't ready much also change operation , 're able remove lot running server , lot -- instance imaging desktop , lot kind essentially kind lower level repetitive work associated delivering service . 're able help professional focused really delivering value . come right time right increasingly pressure desire aligned business business objective . feel like 're riding wave demand start business transformation idea , also includes kind tech transformation large enterprise . recent earnings call , obviously strong growth commercial business . amy called driver , also specifically highlighted microsoft 365 one reason commercial jared spataro heather bellini jared spatarobookings growth ahead expectation . think opportunity ahead ? kind impactful , could ? sure . let 's start remainder baseline stats , think help ground everyone . oﬃce 365 , report , 's monthly active user q1 fiscal year u , reported 200 million monthly active user oﬃce 365. q2 , 've reported number em , report seat 127 million seat em , growing 35 % year-over-year . get third component microsoft 365 , window commercial . reported grew 25 % year-over-year . component growing quite nicely . new data point 'll share , room n't shared look oﬃce 365 purchase quarter oﬃce 365 license purchased m365 microsoft 365. word , 're trying communicate microsoft 365 vehicle allowing u go sell oﬃce 365 , also sell em sell window . think kind upside available u pure sku revenue term , 's kind look like . 's even think value prop , kind reset value prop conversation u . actually make window subscription business , right . know 've got guy rev rec window changed year , make 're paying monthly subscription oﬃce 365 , window probably people room would normally think 's transactional purchase started change . correct . 's would one thing switch thing subscription business , value . category , tried really hard cloud value . oﬃce 'll talk , intelligent service associated oﬃce allow u kind deliver ongoing value em , management cloud-based intelligent based cloud service window , indicate 're able real hope u window window commercial end security , end user value like timeline example cloud-based copy paste simple , mean lot people across device . course innovation , 've introduced thing like window virtual desktop refer wvd 's area cloud-based allows u really go virtualization market window . , 're exactly right . heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataro people wonder much strength success result window 7 end life . talk u little bit term uptake 've seen strong growth 've reported . way discern much impact end life ? course , , go back data point , q2 , 25 % year-over-year growth billing window commercial , 's kind 're starting . definitely window 7 end life continue driver u . think we'll continue even laggard catching , look real value window commercial go well beyond end life moment u 's 'm excited window . security really anchor . thing people excited , they're starting recognize o , one done n't work security service . keep secure value . think -- look long-term growth , would say see sustained double-digit growth billing window commercial business exciting u , something people would thought couple year ago , see real strength . even kind emf strength 've seeing , go back 10 year ago even prior people would say would pay microsoft security . right . market company evolve 're offering security window device corporate would say , n't want pay microsoft . making secure went whole debate way back , em central story . seem customer perception evolve 've got 127 million user em ? em foundational everything . review component year , think 's asset identity , management , security compliance . four component make em . think value prop m365 tapping kind digital transformation business transformation , divide three bucket , bucket personal productivity kind helping end user productive , matter , organizational productivity helping entire org productive . finally , kind guarding security compliance . em critical delivering three value like 's super super important . think identity increasingly identity right identity across heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataroinvestments investment becomes central investment point , becomes control plane , 'd like think . even get management kind boring , people starting recognize cross device , cross platform management super important ability em , example manage window device , go across manage io android device state really important . kind ( inaudible ) value , delivering entire suite 's make important . go drive kind microsoft 365 revenue , 's 're seeing people starting recognize need invest area . think oﬃce 365 mentioned 200 million maus recent call , 127 million user emf . think , gaap number converge start see think potential em oﬃce 365 base totality ? absolutely . let answer specific question , broadening think business . specific question would absolutely think 200 million mau , would certainly want attach em , definitely think dip two number upside . also think dip mau seat oﬃce 365 , dip , n't disclose seat , delta calculating . general , pattern see would go component me3 microsoft 365 e3 step people me5 . 's monetization train 're raiding right 's pattern we're essentially developing sale force , 's caused u develop new sale motion entirely go . new sale notion ? well , awesome opportunity . use sell kind coverage . 's . oﬃce essentially call wxp , word excel powerpoint , could add outlook perhaps mail , core value prop productivity microsoft . stepped way beyond wxp , people think oﬃce sale motion coverage coming saying , hey , person need email , need oﬃce moved much solution sale kind oriented thing actually able walk talk heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataroabout personal productivity , organizational productivity security compliance . upside 're tapping new budget , awesome . downside , little bit longer sale cycle , 'm . 's kind balancing u go new opportunity . think people migrated oﬃce 365 early , maybe n't use emf . -- noticed trend ? situation could talk people actually maybe using something else emf , using oﬃce 365 started converting switch right , see happening ? absolutely , one idea example come mind national bank canada . start kind got motivated , started , specifically idea business transformation . interested kind coming 21st century everything heavy , heavy oﬃce user , generally , oﬃce user kind oﬃce staff necessarily retailer . able lock stack , moved microsoft 365 suite mean going oﬃce adding em window commercial . also particular case , introducing team new way collaborating within six month organization went nothing kind collaboration 50 % org using team within nine month 80 % . 's really nice way kind seen move old profile customer kind like see customer . amy also talk success impact em adoption azure azure gross margin . 's per seat pricing model . seem like 's lot runway continue see penetration . also idea time could see upward sku migration , even though someone might existing customer paying $ 5 per user per month going opportunity similar oﬃce 365 start moving skus existing customer actually start driving even incremental revenue . absolutely , microsoft 365 , strategy behind based idea think someone using microsoft 365 , find even gate , higher arpu lower churn , really good . heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spatarothen finally , point exactly , much higher propensity time consumed call premium skus . e5 even component e5 , give u opportunity walk stack 's u 's golden formula . love microsoft 365 drive business . -- talked little bit lower churn mentioned , material ? cause lower churn ? let 's go enterprise smb . enterprise churn something 's really big problem u . right . move smb certainly turn something part managing business time . microsoft 365 helped u delivering new value go beyond kind word excel powerpoint , definitely able see change kind shape churn look like positive direction u . think overall kind using microsoft 365 , effort new sale motion 've implemented n't value selling , 've also value realization 've invested instance , got csm , customer success manager , lot tech company , new microsoft last couple year , across stack segment , actually go help realize value . 're using , 've got great number show 're using getting value churn go away like fact add go stack term skus add -- time . right . , take look security market , typically , 's best breed market right , guess think ability compete point solution exist across various category ? place 's useful step back talk strategy microsoft 365 general , ( inaudible ) security , think come heather bellini jared spatarotalk team , example . really going , call compromise strategy think best-in-class think best integration , possible particularly security look player , point player , gone best breed particular area , see opportunity actually really go make investment way matter . look 've invested security start identity talking em later , move device , go device apps , move app information apps , got way cloud service . finally cap threat protection essentially kind look across touch point infrastructure . area , 're trying invest deeply , committed best class , addition investment , 're also investing across area way think make u differentiated . ignite back september , couple product announcement , lot product announcement , couple project cortex also endpoint manager product announced . feedback far ? also , evolution , expecting add-on skus ? yes , great feedback . let talk endpoint manager . , 'd say management place sleepy . feel like increasingly becoming strategic company recognize , hey first step digital transformation business transformation actually making sure get directory right making sure manage device , right . , endpoint manager u , microsoft endpoint manager brings together tune config man , two kind one cloud one kind on-prem based service put single integrated service really big deal u . reaction 's super positive . project cortex refer heather really big one u . open new market u brand new tam . essentially idea knowledge capturing knowledge within company . using ai actually identify codified knowledge way 's valuable . one simple example would taking whole heap contract pointing cortex , actually pull q & understand 's contract , everything late fee deadline would coming thing 'd usually human go scan , cortex . 's whole new investment area , think brand new tam u . answer , final question , ma'am , 're excited way we're pursuing m365 , microsoft 365 , look tam expansive opportunity . heather bellini jared spataro heather bellinisome adjacent , push u little bit , really bring definition productivity 're saying 're going expand productivity look like looking problem challenge customer . window virtual desktop ? mentioned think announced product back september '18 , think 'm mistaken . heard customer , citrix yesterday , mean , they've got complementary partnership , 's question come lot investment community kind see relationship , also ambition product ? let wvd window virtual desktop , talk partner , let talk go-forward strategy . first said , wvd 's excellent success u , defining feature window virtual desktop ability change economics virtualization . able change economics , run multiple user virtual machine way 's seamless user experience kind ca n't believe . -- allowed u deliver virtualization different level term pricing . love . second , always , 're producing great service love partner come add top service , 's exactly 're trying , citrix , 's case since beginning time . 's run ecosystem . see opportunity , citrix , certainly see opportunity build top wvd service . third go forward u continue work customer start -- started deploy wvd , get excited see opportunity really rethink computing look like time . mean , take step back look instance able buy fairly low cost hardware endpoint , deliver would equivalent $ 10,000 $ 20,000 machine virtualized experience , change economics look like deliver computing power end user . see long-term opportunity 're investing . place space see lot opportunity u . interesting market think people hoping would really fast growing market fast follower server virtualization , n't happened . mean starting -- definitely getting better data point around last year , need see happen mentioned right $ 200 $ 300 box right put desk jared spataro heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataro heather bellinito give experience might working hpc machine , need happen order become reality ? would say three thing , number one , endpoint need become virtual like cloud aware , let 's call , take step back cloud aware way take virtualized service pop experience way feel native . today , little bit clunky , 're spending something , window sudden look like whole new desktop , might virtualize app , n't feel like belongs . endpoint need get much smarter much intelligent . number two , service need get bit finished today , look wvd , 's way spin virtualization . think want go opportunity finished service offer kind unique spin . number three , think , think opportunity really rethink virtualization deliver new value , mean , certain sector like healthcare place found value virtualization , think place security , compliance , desire instance deliver kind footprint list computing environment would n't really matter , virtualization hard expense people found . first two , actually think new use case evolve . rich fertile soil u grow business , 'm sure hear u time . 've got handful question , recognize lot people audience wanted check see 's question field , could move . somebody got ask team , 's care , . right , 'll ask team . beautiful . jared spataro heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataroall right . increasing area focus . sure . lot press , recently announced think 20 million daus right , back november . 's correct . user adoption engagement track versus expectation ? 's phenomenal . 'm honest . let start dau thing 's lot needling . let define dau . daily active user u maximum number user taken intentional action 24- hour period , 's really important hit . call passive action count . auto boot count , minimizing window count , closing app count , also -- 's lot question . got , yeah . skype count . release number , n't feel like want get weed kind argue people , dau real . love 're seeing team . team many way become campus project best microsoft 365 , 's way think . new opportunity u think operating system future really look like , put people center , make comment communication , kind backplane people work together , 're layering business process , 're layering integration line business system sale , mean truly , truly phenomenal 's taken u . 's want somebody ask really love 's happening . heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataroit become someone say business digital transformation , say team even n't ask question , say team 's hard u way really represent new way working . conversation enterprise gone ? , go back year ago 18 month ago , still probably pretty nascent market adoption really seems like 's inﬂected ? 's caused ? go-to- market changed ? sale people incented differently ? that's really cause inﬂection ? internal external factor . external side , see company desperately want find many way , symbolic clear way change 're working together . team allows , able say , hey , new way thing , 's form one value prop , there's chat , call , collaborate say , 're going certain business process way . kind symbolic value company change . internally started realize lot demand , good product market fit 're always looking like 's catching fire realize wow , thing fire . course , mobilized resource go help customer adapt . , hired lot customer success manager , really important set investment made . certainly worked really hard integration team rest kind productivity element people use suite . 's product investment well type interaction customer . one competitor market would highlight limitation product highlight thing -- ca n't 5,000 people channel , otherwise multiple channel might defeat purpose trying seamless communication . -- 's form ? n't ? what's real ? 's term back forth , term functionality ? guess , n't start ? think , think form thought hub teamwork , multiple competitor . 're trying team 're going pull together slack , zoom , dropbox google , 's kind fact life choose use team . competitor strength gap , would say -- super clear gap leader category , invest every day , every day , heather bellini jared spataro heather bellini jared spataroevery day close gap . please n't think n't know . also real competitive strength , 're also working really hard strengthen thing . let 's focus second , mentioned gap . pick top two three , kind 's development cycle ? fast iterating product , whereas maybe year ago , maybe six really big gap overcome might three , -- help u think gap evolved 've narrowing gap ? also -- 's top one two value proposition 're going customer lead know 're far ahead ? great . take chat colab , place behind year half ago , boy gap chat colab versus chat colab folk , almost non-existent point . still couple small one , scale , mentioned one kind channel scalability would example one . ca n't think many others work customer really big difference , even platform investment example , work 've make team platform , 's far ahead competitor . take instance meeting , company like zoom done really well , small gap 've seen course last 18 month , done lot instance quality feel really good quality stand today . look across others , gap small getting smaller way feel . go back strategy . strategy really best-in-class best integration compromise 's exactly 're trying . go question like say walk customer win day every time , end combination hub teamwork win every time say , hey , watch , 're going go paying someone chat bringing three people co-authoring document , see other's face finally moving approval workﬂow . submit bid , 's happens one platform totally differentiated that's winning , right . right . think 's helpful thing people think paying point integration , n't go team ? heather bellini jared spataro heather bellinithere two really big aspect integration , n't go team . first actually find way plug workﬂow mean ﬂow work together 's everything detail identity kind access like , put thing , referenced ? 's one practical bucket thing . second practical bucket thing end security compliance . create security compliance boundary around thing ensures secure always scenario compliance regulation matter industry field work . two area integration expensive . 's place 're investing . that's platform . last question marketing team . marketing strategy enterprise level , also think 've recently gotten little bit maybe double got aggressive smb side . talk u -- walk u kind different way 're attracting customer ? bet . ( inaudible ) , think love working focused , hey find opportunity , let 's double use word let 's really go team certainly popped one 12 month 18 month ago . think kind broad air cover , investing resource advertising something n't typically app , started , kick , nfl prior super bowl continue u 'll expand market . 's important find category still under-known need find way make sure people understand . think attracting people , 've worked really hard call on-ramps . single place people go sign , whether license already , n't know n't license want get going product , working super hard single place go , go -- team microsoft.com 're sign , 're smart enough know . company license , put right team experience connected everyone , n't , start new free tenant way kind really working friction week week week , process really important part new microsoft , . great . think 're time , jared . thank much . appreciate . jared spataro thank .
