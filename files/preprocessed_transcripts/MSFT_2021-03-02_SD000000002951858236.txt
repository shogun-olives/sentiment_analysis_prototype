good evening . good afternoon . keith wei morgan stanley 's equity research department . run software research group . pleased u end day -- think one presentation -- day one tmt conference , jason zander , executive vice president azure microsoft . definitely topic talk lot , investor talking lot . 're really happy jason u afternoon chat thing azure , 's going business . get started , brief disclosure important morgan stanley research disclosure , please website www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures . one programming note . bunch question 're going going . ( operator instruction ) way , jason , thank much joining u control room . look like 're going landing next mar rover behind right . den actually . went overboard . wife 's oﬃce . 's cloud collaboration center redmond . 's right campus . basically use place hackathons , et cetera . little bit quiet covid . normally place packed -- hopefully . excellent . jason , , thank coming conference . azure cloud definitely super high list topical debate investor . azure - keith wei - jason zander - keith wei - jason zanderdefinitely core investment thesis microsoft . great . question answer maybe start , could outline little bit role responsibility microsoft evp azure . cover total . yes . evp azure , remit , 're kind like call system team microsoft , ceo like call u . mean 'll everything silicon quantum computing , operating system , window linux provide rest company . cloud software infrastructure paas . data analytics , iot , 'll operational side . set vertical actually help specialize . recently , 've lot work around telco communication operator space well , 's part core strategy . 's job -- day job evp , 'm also member microsoft 's senior leadership team . 's nutshell . outstanding . 's great purview . maybe start big picture question , sort overall kind public cloud space , 've seen rapid pace innovation past 2 three year . 've seen microsoft really see explosive growth category . talk u bigger change 've seen overall marketplace past couple year sort crisis . could talk sort type change pace change see coming crisis . yes . leading crisis , course , big trend people moving data center public cloud . , course , continues . talk pace moment , maybe around covid-19 . course , 's huge amount work u . would say big area 're seeing return change lot focused around data analytics . basically , unlock data silo , get understanding , get insight say , competitive one 's super important . 're also seeing whole bunch adoption across area like iot . 's effort started five year ago team , trillion message day . - keith wei - jason zanderhave unbelievably really great set customer , lighthouse win , et cetera . lot work . ai ml continues hot trend . 'd say one big area , , thinking vertical specialization working folk industry lot stuff talked horizontal could considered supporting . think 're seeing u get involved vertical business value proposition well . got . got . 's great hear . higher-value solution really coming forefront , becoming bigger part story . analyst looking financial perspective , like hear higher-value solution better gross margin . kind shift focus sort happened past year , calendar '20 , moving forward . lot people talking -- think started satya . came april conference call . think 's 1 first really talk crisis accelerating pace digital transformation . made comment seeing like two year digital transformation past 6 week . talk 're seeing term customer interaction . mean customer 're talking they're accelerating pace digital transformation ? yes . satya 's totally right . mean , saw , course , everybody needed respond quickly . got folk need work home , got school home , whatever look like . found already cloud path able react quickly , oftentimes day opposed might month n't plan place . really proved point digital transformation . 's hyperscale cloud , saas service . saw huge amount volume . think seen since people often case , looked , opportunity move faster . think one thing , team able say , gosh , something 2 week originally planned go spend next year . 's like , okay , maybe actually move faster . maybe n't taking long . see sentiment . also think company looked forward-looking also impact cost envelope . extent cloud helping get better - keith wei - jason zanderoperational envelope , essentially , spending , need everything ? could cloud take care ? 's actually helped acceleration migration workload adoption future piece . question economy get stronger , course , hope expectation u everyone else space 'll able see additional growth related . got . got . want sneak one tactical question . something think mike spencer , head ir , talked u . heard conference call went crisis , microsoft reached helped customer better use azure resource . talk u kind rationalizing spend . talk u exactly mean went helped customer , make sure 're utilizing azure eﬃciently possible ? yes , absolutely . mean , one thing -- would say even thing back 2008. end day , 's helping customer successful often could challenging kind situation . want somebody 's actually partnering customer . mean 're usually looking way help weather storm well . one turn core value proposition cloud . actually tool built operational portal allow user come back , 'll give recommendation , 'll actually come back say , could actually saving money bill . maybe allocated super big virtual machine run workload , workload really using maybe quarter , quarter close . actually downsizing saving money . 've actually built thing product system . think 's value -- honestly , generally find help somebody save money budget , -- modular recession covid-19 kind related stuff , usually , happens 've got project backlog . 'd like get . - keith wei - jason zander - keith wei - jason zanderthey may even strategic 're already . help free budget , unlocks next set project opposed even bringing . 's kind win-win point . right . guess side equation , prove azure eﬃcient platform , 's utilizable use case economical use case . understand real eﬃciency platform . 's correct . generally , find kind hockey-stick pattern , right ? mean , start getting operational environment place . start figuring operate thing . start training staff . get first workload going , start realizing , wow , faster . 's eﬃcient , point , actually help save money . start seeing steep rise kick . think overall , 's actually great optimization customer . like said , increase usage right way . got . -- hopefully , -- exit crisis get back normalized environment , think -- talked acceleration sort shift cloud -- acceleration digital transformation effort . see fundamental change way people thinking cloud architecture ? microsoft 's always talked lot hybrid architecture . 's going on-premise public cloud . shift go-forward basis ? shift towards public cloud versus on-premise , given went ? still think 's going relatively hybrid environment go-forward basis ? think 's going hybrid environment . course , 's one tenant design since beginning azure . case cloud company , put hybrid slide usually meant migration . case , meant , 're going on-premises edge , going public cloud . want combination . think 's actually cemented . fact , look even competitive perspective , 're starting see even company compete start produce actually call real hybrid solution . seem - keith wei - jason zander - keith wei - jason zander - keith weissto backed disk , right strategy . course , benefit u since day 1 , 've got rich product portfolio support going forward . would say another thing , , , frankly , went covid , supply chain bunch stuff . think lot company started realize much needed keep track dependency , deploying thing . even world may even want control , whether that's data center 's hybrid scale country , hybrid cloud country , want regulation rule around . area 've investing , think oﬃce 365 15 year . 've investing control support kind thing . think way 've built product way run actually lends well trend show along line . got . 're talking kind definition sort define various kind cloud architecture . one thing get thrown around lot , think different definition different people idea multi cloud , right ? hear lot smaller best-of-breed vendor talking customer want optionality . n't want get locked one big cloud vendor . 's always going multi-cloud type solution . given conversation large kind public cloud user , cio large enterprise talking multi-cloud , mean ? -- multi-cloud architecture actually look like ? yes . case , chosen strategically figure ( inaudible ) jason , 'm sorry , volume got low . hear , okay ? 's still low . - jason zander - keith wei - jason zander - keith wei - jason zander right . better ? yes . 's much better . okay . sorry . 's -- even though 'm fancy area , 'm still using laptop . ab problem still mine . , sorry , yes . apologize , discussing ... talking multi-cloud environment mean end customer . multi-cloud environment . yes . sorry , 'm busy tech support . yes . multi-cloud environment perspective , oftentimes , happen people make decision around , want one vendor i'm working . course , 're going absolutely respect . case , may decide make certain project feel like 've got best-in-class solution azure synapse , azure purview . really want data analytics absolutely . maybe already started infrastructure work another cloud . want support . 's set thing think folk need keep mind . one , certain amount expense associated got security control . got management-related work . mean 're going , like isvs , time . isvs target one cloud . actually invest , expensive . created technology like azure arc , designed allow thing like security policy protocol . work hybrid . work big cloud provider . work on-premises , top vmware , et cetera . thing azure arc , also data discovery tool azure purview , azure sentinel security . lot way , 'll see u produce set best-in-class technology around security management , deployment , et cetera . 'll work everybody , help least get top level , still multi cloud . absolutely continue support open source . 're worried lock , great , use open source , work everybody . - keith wei - jason zanderand course , still partner bunch isvs particular domain . course , run big cloud . make sure first-class experience . sap fantastic example . got . want shift gear little bit talk available market , tam , , azure . couple year back , dave o'hara tmt conference . made -- 's executive would say , known hyperbole . made statement stage . said like , `` oﬃce 365 great , 're limited amount knowledge worker globe . great thing azure like target optimizing opex . 's like 's virtually unlimited market opportunity . '' sound excited exciting sound huge . 's hard investor wrap head around opex . give u hand understanding microsoft think market opportunity ? dimension think term trying size , trying rightsize investment term market opportunity today 's growing go-forward basis . yes . dave 's cfo , work directly . yes , 're right . 's prone hyperbole . 're absolutely right . know , dave , know exactly 're talking . 's right opportunity . would actually come top level . opportunity tam probably like ( $ 4 trillion . ) address everything , everything silicon , hardware , vertical , et cetera . mean , 's massive , massive , massive market . even bring back start thinking maybe 's $ 1 trillion , that's still $ 1 trillion . get estimate , hey , infrastructure service , hundred billion dollar , data , et cetera . couple different thing one . go back address tam , 're , course , going start 'd call like horizontal support . course , infrastructure . data . analytics . iot . used domain 's . would say big thing see , 's combination kind like migration . existing workload , want run hybrid/hyperscale cloud . course , get lot folk leverage u . - keith wei - jason zander - keith wei - jason zanderthen 's case people actually modernizing . 'm taking tier 1 workload , something maybe running data center , even different set isv software 20 year ago , 're modernizing they're saying , want cloud thing . man , guy got mission-critical tier 1 support . 's another opportunity u go spend perhaps different isvs past . , cloud vertical u . get vertical . see work 've done , microsoft cloud health care , cloud retail , cloud manufacturing actually announced , agriculture , et cetera . think see technology need meet need particular industry , 's 's tam expensive . 're solution , give powerpoints excel everybody use kid ' soccer game $ 1 trillion sovereign wealth fund . great . work . case , get much vertical . think opportunity u . going . got . got . 's massive term tam 're describing . think investment profile , particularly geographic footprint azure term region data center , continues grow . investor think pace growth go-forward basis term lot new geos need ? lot expansion footprint need done ? pretty good footprint right , 's kind filling data center go-forward basis ? yes . let also one comment . say 're going vertical , want make sure 'm also clear . partnering si , isvs , basically , -- 're competing customer . cloud . actually think , gosh , go capture margin , look like good opportunity . case , 're going continue partner . think huge opportunity u go space help enable ecosystem . -- want make sure 'm clear n't cause confusion . question ... whole another section vertical cloud 're going dig , we'll able come back one . - keith wei - jason zanderall right . 'll able come back . want make sure clarify statement upfront . , yes , global expansion perspective , -- goal try make sure serving essentially bulk world 's gdp . look region 've got , 's 60 , getting pretty much great coverage worldwide perspective . 'll continue go go . think , , kind increased thinking around sovereignty government , privacy , et cetera , sort thing , always going important . think lends even better hybrid strategy build hyperscale data center region cost billion dollar go go create . keep going providing worldwide coverage , 's always going economically viable . 's real hybrid strategy come handy still give cloud asset sort availability . added another 7 data center alone q2 . 've actually increased eﬃciency fast go build thing , get ready , land , operate , continue increase eﬃciency across set thing well . 's actually super important 're going make technology available much pivoting towards technology , really want make sure 's available world 's consumer world 's business . got . could sort take little bit detour talk differentiation drive underlying infrastructure term whether 's geographic footprint way set infrastructure one question got client whether could differentiate silicon whether guy working differentiate silicon . talk potential differentiation core infrastructure layer , ? yes , sure . mean core infra layer still significant amount r & effort need go . mean , obviously , 've done well respect eﬃciencies . fast build , fast time operate . impact , course , margin , et cetera . also impact capacity customer make sure keep growing always rely u provide . -- thing build software need run number hardware skus , know kind location . . 's called window server , sql server , set product . - keith wei - jason zanderbut 's going data center , hardware everything certified , significantly optimization north , south stack -- everything silicon , hardware , hypervisor , et cetera . entire software , hardware silicon stack , optimize entire thing . also pulled supply chain figure get , run scale , mean afford go level customization . allows u support new workload , keep bringing cog also continue go kind price performance requirement space . 's something ca n't unless 're hyperscale cloud . 's hyperscale cloud actually scale pull . got . got . turning azure growth opportunity go-forward basis . know microsoft n't give estimate -- n't give number sort run rate azure . estimate $ 30 billion revenue run rate right . think next several year , would stack rank best growth opportunity ? excited term driving new dollar azure platform next , say , 2 three year ? yes . 'm actually quite pleased , course , q2 number cloud segment . $ 16.7 billion q2 ( 50 % ) number mention azure , , course , already growing good-sized business . 're excited . respect concrete question , see segment ? look , 's still whole bunch work 's front u industry respect making shift hyperscale data center . whole bunch data center deal 're , whole bunch folk migration work want . , talked pace kind accelerating based kind economic condition . 's still going bread butter , 's still whole bunch work . really think data analytics probably one biggest one popping right speak . 's need people able break data silo . get faster loop tying system record operational system able pull insight drive business . - keith wei - jason zanderand tech 's , think awesome solution azure synapse , azure purview , cosmos db . mean 're seeing pattern pop place 's actually really great pattern able actually optimize business . 's huge area addressable revenue speak . one 've got longer bet , , trying work within vertical industry figuring way help would actually continue grow going forward . part . think 've got really good play across . got . got . -- maybe could dig one kind growth category little bit deeper . think sort core shifting workload public cloud . survey every quarter , think twice year asked question percent workload running different environment . think recent survey , -- overall , cloud 24 % workload include software service . infrastructure service , platform service right around 10 % , 11 % overall workload . one , kind put think industry term overall rate penetration ? two , kind key driver sort pushing people ? like industry stickier like able get compliance regulatory , 're ready ? security concern yet done ? like incremental catalyst driving number higher perspective ? yes . number , roughly sound right . say feel like 's still lot runway front u . mean . directionally , saying around number , yes , kind make sense . think , big set project people go go . big thing 's really changed last year matter . 's . like joined azure team 2012 , 's kind like , , prime data center cold hand , right ? different kind era . think fact 're number , 's lot runway front u , make sense , people really coming , plan , got move . place thought stickier , even couple year ago . financial sector couple , health care , area like . , regulatory system , defense area well . oftentimes , - keith wei - jason zander - keith wei - jason zander - keith weissthere either specialization and/or high degree sophistication present . think cloud matured significantly since . run -- 've running socs workload microsoft cloud year . think 've done . start seeing , example , defense adoption show usually , defense contractor defense space looking fintech , fintech guy looking defense . ... jason , think lost audio . right . hold . 'm going take one . hear okay ? yes . yes . okay . good . right . risk looking right face , 'm going risk microphone . worked 2 hour nonstop . ( inaudible ) laptop pick . anyway , like said , think 're seeing people waiting single lever security , regulation kind maturity . 's , 've moving fintechs , fan , et cetera , quite . think look business , retail lot quicker . 's lot longer . think 're past ( inaudible ) . got . got . data analytics side , deep dive report overall kind market term data management on-prem side equation , cloud side equation . think investor n't surprised see market share gain microsoft making on-premise side equation . sql server database getting lot performant , 's lot le expensive competitor like oracle . think surprising part equation microsoft , far , leading share cloud-based database . talk kind got position ? think idc number something like $ 1.6 billion cloud-based database . sql server database ? cosmos ? synapse ? like guy - jason zander - keith weissseeing strength ? guy think competitive dynamic cloud versus on-premise ? yes . big thing want -- first , solution ? sql server's absolutely core part situation , open-source data business . offer post -- mysql . open source database . run regular system . course , license people run third-party database top platform , . 've investing sql service , server service , et cetera , last eight year , pretty solid . actually changed built product ship product . addition , 's kind relational side house . look cosmos db operational kind database . synapse , pulled whole thing together started blur line category . see huge amount adoption across . 's 're kind seeing adoption pull- , 're super excited . really , , idea taking system record operational database synapse link , pulling together getting tight analytics loop without old-fashioned transforms stuff slow stuff . 's differentiated technology . 's also , think , another good reason feel like 've gotten really good adoption related . respect question like , hey , talk little bit kind like hybrid , et cetera , environment look like ? try super ﬂexible , , like truth nobody move data cloud overnight . 's combination 've got on-premises , 've got cloud . federate . work workload . 're big enterprise , 's reality . even want move cloud , 're going take period time . azure hybrid benefit , bring license . like 1/3 server user use hybrid benefit . give ﬂexibility able move workload , one place . get right kind hybrid solution . got . dig real quickly azure hybrid benefit . 's something , amy -- called u lot part core driver kept on- premise serving tool part equation growing really nicely last couple - jason zander - keith wei - jason zanderof year . -- exactly hybrid cloud benefit ? important cio ? good growth driver guy ? hybrid benefit , basically , allows ﬂexibility use license . 've got window server , sql server , decide keep on-premises decide actually put azure cloud . fact , actually move decision go based business requires . like mentioned , 1/3 window server , sql server user actually leveraging hybrid benefit , license kind mobility ﬂexibility . truth , 5x expensive run application cloud provider . 's cost economics much cheaper run use azure ﬂexibility able decide , want on-prem . want cloud . maybe 'm going change solution based upon project , ultimate ﬂexibility 're looking . got . want sneak one question investor . think pertinent sort data analytics story . could new technology like snowﬂake , cloud- based data warehousing vendor , commoditize hyperscalers compress long-term margin . snowﬂake partner space . first foremost , absolutely always make sure company like snowﬂake , sap , vmware , 's whole bunch company partner . may alternate solution . maybe 've got solution space . first foremost , 're going make sure customer choice right ( inaudible ) running snowﬂake get azure marketplace . 're running platform . mean maybe data warehouse snowﬂake , also put power bi whole bunch thing ecosystem cloud , 's actually also customer-friendly good win . , 're going make sure run workload best-in-class , frankly , really wanted work best-in-class , even selfishly , n't , people would pick different cloud could get outcome . course , want make sure 's alignment u partner . 're going keep . respect margin , , 's multiple different way think like end , somebody picked snowﬂake , 's choice . 'm going talk best run top badger - keith wei - jason zanderopportunities , like said , extended ecosystem around snowﬂake , benefit , 's complementary snowﬂake . pick ﬂat yet , course , 'm going pitch azure synapse tell , think 's best possible choice , let 's let make call . end day , think cloud big picture win , getting folk cloud , use high order bid . get within , , course , want differentiate product , let 's take cloud . business perspective , strategic win u , open sort revenue opportunity . got . another interesting investor question 'm going try sneak . kind talk pace workload adoption also brings sort developer equation . question kubernetes whether rising adoption kubernetes container architecture , could make easier . could provide lubricant , , pushing workload public cloud environment developer sort new application development take place kubernetes ? absolutely great opportunity . mean , nothing else , container environment make much simpler agile company able take workload start getting -- even dev test purpose . point , like want go land . get container world , allows leverage . include looking public cloud . good win agility perspective , help migration side . good news co-creator kubernetes actually azure team . brendan burn actually google co-creator kubernetes , came actually build azure kubernetes service azure . written guy co-created standard first place . 've got awesome set technology built . , solution work hybrid perspective edge also cloud . think development pattern , use software development . think make ton sense . 's good step towards even completely cloud-native server-less , another kind set technology 's one step past container . 'll see - keith wei - jason zandersome additional adoption come sort thing well . yes . modernization , really good productivity win . got . got . wanted turn gear cloud verticalization something mentioned earlier . think last year , guy announced first industry- specific cloud offering , health care last year . usually talked microsoft cloud retail . think guy nrf show . , believe , announcement last week ahead build week manufacturing cloud , 'm missing couple . talk u verticalized cloud one side equation ? point , different amazon saying hey , listen , 're going store , right ? deverticalization actually come solution . yes . microsoft , -- , talk vertical support cloud health care , cloud manufacturing last week , et cetera . know designed complementary ecosystem . , work si , work isvs , going likely partner someone 's vertical like retailer logistics 're going take pick . 'll partner think 're bringing software , platform , edge capability , bring table . want partner folk best-in-class different area . that's cloud . provide ? find -- rather saying , look , bet oﬃce 365 , whatever want . go cloud health care , example , actually see solution around patient telehealth thing like thing like leverage microsoft team microsoft oﬃce 365 dynamic . 'll see thing integrated solution . rather go build thing scratch , actually leverage tech . 'm also using multiple isvs , one thing 've seen especially larger organization also need bridge . may still particular area one partner really vertical solution , 've got another department us different one . bring thing together . solution we're optimizing vertical cloud . think approach work pretty well - keith wei - jason zander - keith weissbecause 's longer kind chemistry set -- could anything , 's kind hard . 're making actually first-class solution . make faster adoption . actually partner-friendly . versus , , setting shop saying , well , look like good industry . go look cooky . mean 's definitely ( inaudible ) . got . give end customer isv system integrator , head start building solution template fit industry template already kind aligned problem business process trying automated . specific technology would align -- like , like commerce technology retail cloud versus n't know , maybe hipaa type technology health care cloud ? technology specific vertical ? yes , absolutely . let 's take couple good example . think health care , idea telehealth ability go . mean , especially since we're still covid protocol , part world , able come leverage something like microsoft team transcription subtitling rest work plus , course , communication , ims . like 's example health care super , super interesting . 's could n't also use universal comms industry . 's case 's specific relevant . think manufacturing , case lead built azure iot , fact already actually used big oems build , let 's say , industrial equipment , 's thing like building elevator milling machine line . mean , already . fact come help pull thing together , 're looking accelerant even partner ecosystem every project turn start-from-scratch kind thing . example . manufacturing , universal coms telehealth , et cetera . good example . several . got . got . think maybe kind wrapping . talked kind machine learning ai one core driver go- forward basis . - jason zanderfrom perspective , think one thing 're learning 've lean past year couple year . machine learning ai 's dependent data side equation , right ? think software opportunity much anything , able make use data , whether 's iot data , whether 's existing data 's taking place legacy system able pull able make sense data put together . 's one side equation . putting machine learning algorithm underlying kind compute together solve specific problem . guy try bring together , , right ? broad set technology put , sort weigh balance like customer want technology side equation need data integration data manipulation tool , . need overall solution saying , listen , 's inventory management , inventory optimization , 's whole solution . present go-to-market span spectrum exactly like type machine learning solution customer looking ? definitely capture challenge . mean , truth everyone partner maybe different layer stack . think though logical thing , starting foundation , stub wall , ﬂoors , ceiling , shingle . kind think particular way . , course , want make sure first foremost , best possible infrastructure anyone want run ai . could advanced company . deep partnership openai , 're advanced research anywhere , massive -- huge , huge compute huge number parameter model like unbelievably big . case , 're going partner make sure base foundation . go stack , find folk like , look , really want add kind image recognition , thing like iot , image recognition get trained camera conveyor belt , looking part treated picking defect . 's probably , n't want start scratch , n't want go build entire whole data center go . want simple image recognition . provide paas service provide simple api cost developer . plug data , actually simple training . sudden , get running . n't - keith weissexpenses . n't hire 18 data analyst come work get value . 's end . course , get top level , 've integrated lot ai saas application . case -- mean , 'll see oﬃce 365. productivity recommendation , heck even developer tool , kind telecode inside vision inter developer . analyzes code running compare whole bunch code 's analyzed tell could written better , cleaner , safer code , really freaking amazing . 's driven whole bunch data . , think infrastructure layer , got . apis simple use , want get started . saas layer , well . think pretty much help layer . , r & , last thing i'll mention one . r & effort around ai massive . work openai , one example . one like using holographic processing unit hololens think sucker , essentially photon coming eyeball , captured camera , augmented holographic image , come eye brain can't tell difference . like take one month train ai model go holographic processing unit put hololens , like , wow , like want know microsoft invested like wow . 's people like oftentimes , people n't think , incredibly advanced ai . , 's another example -- given infrastructure , give tool library . anytime hard stuff like , try make available service offering inside azure . others . got . got . wanted u little bit security . 's interesting conversation security microsoft . go back 5 , seven year ago , right ? security friction getting people adopt public cloud , adopt azure security perhaps something microsoft working get people confident using software overall . recent conference call , 've gone far way security $ 10 billion business microsoft . 's underlying infrastructure secure enough guy run stuff firm like morgan stanley run within azure . security expertise productized 're selling marketplace . - jason zandercan talk little bit azure security , term gotten term security infrastructure . also , solution 're selling end market ? know sentinel term sim . security solution built azure ? yes . 's huge area , point . 've always work secure , course , service . oﬃce 365 , xbox , name , 've always go . built system handle . one thing 've done -- course , 've window window socket , et cetera . 've done 've gone back take thing 've built actually pull customer , , ( inaudible ) use . start end point . 's window pc . also like android , iphone iot . 're actually security iot device . actually pull understand 's going make sure firmware 's date , et cetera . 's part security regimen 're . come back cloud side , look defender , use apps defender well microsoft , microsoft defenderfor oﬃce 365 's piece go . 's super important give look device historical . mentioned sentinel , 's actually differentiated piece technology . cloud-based seat , basically need 've done entirely cloud . already handling petabyte unbelievable number signal every day , pull stuff together . expectation able use combination defender , end point -- protection 've got . sentinel able track 're able use steam based technology . thing come together quite well . see business traction 's , 's 're . think value proposition business , think , going super valuable put much simplicity 're handling much space . n't cobble together solution . build default product , oﬃce 365 , azure , security thing come together . think 's actually pretty powerful combination . still plug-in work vendor , source data . actually look hybrid environment , , like cloud based , like mentioned , already - keith wei - jason zander - keith weissheterogeneous end point , vendor kind device . got . got . 10 minute left session . bunch investor question want get . 's couple category . i'm going try kind bunch . lot question competitive environment , particularly versus aws gcp . maybe sort question 'll pose guy think competition ? -- hyperscalers ? change move like infrastructure service level platform service level ? different type competitive dynamic ? yes . 'd say infrastructure level , course , compete fact 've done hybrid work , 've really invested year software even appliance-level solution 've got worldwide coverage . infrastructure level , 's , course , look . paas perspective , 's area really pushed hard long period time . mentioned time . think data analytics space , purview , synapse , et cetera , think differentiator . super interesting u able , , compete . 's also dynamic , , 're going partner , compete . still relevant lot case , lot folk . want make sure 're picking somebody 's technology provider 's helping . actually going business . 's complementary thing important . thing . , help customer get premium service . 's higher-margin structure u , make lot easier . also beneficial business . 's competitive environment . that's good customer . think , , big long-term strategic bet like hybrid super important . honestly , lot -- especially enterprise customer , probably working u vendor . probably preferred vendor decade . count . trust also delivery , trust partnership 've long time also go competitive evaluation . got . got . 's helpful . 've actually getting lot question silicon semiconductor . one say , entering time value/ip - jason zandermigrating back semi layer hardware layer ? interesting thing azure enable compute side reasonable company could . 's another question vision road map arm . portion workload expect migrating custom silicon time . lot question value migrating back silicon layer . address ? yes . cloud going often different kind client form factor . let 's talk cloud , 's core remit . cloud perspective , , spending money . 'm buying equipment , software stack well , pretty much . give ownership north , south . even partner particular level like component vendor , chip cpu , whatever , 'm still buying enough , still optimize entire stack , mean 've already long period time , worked even silicon provider customizations make sense environment . thing could proprietary . actually go back fit core . 'll give concrete example confidential computing . secure enclave technology think going critical bunch forward-leaning security work . 's something worked intel five year nobody else . 've already gone deeper , 's amd version , 's actually arm version technology . example data center , enterprise , go back ask , 'd never enough volume probably able justify , n't staff electrical engineer . staff electrical engineer since go kind work . think expect 'll continue make sort investment . , 's silicon , 's also hardware form factor around . component integration , et cetera , mean nvram kind distributed memory , another great example innovation industry 's showing cloud first primary thing . get benefit fact get run ﬂeet way want run ﬂeet mean make sure 's fully optimized north , south . -- maybe stop make sense . asked question -- type cpu . first , -- follow-up - keith wei - jason zanderon . otherwise , think answer question around arm versus x64 , et cetera ? yes , let 's go like arm ability sort customize load shift . yes . great . yes . look , mean , like couple different thing . one , fully expect 're going continue add capability . 's gpus , ( inaudible ) , 's cpu . 's component . networking gear thing like place 've done whole bunch customer work well want fast time , want control , et cetera . 've done lot customer work around . 'll see . cpu perspective , think truth significant portion existing software , especially enterprise software still x64 long period time . 's 're optimizing . big database run , big kind isv software , et cetera . bulk stuff 's running x64 today . course , great partnership intel . great partnership amd , primary silicon vendor cpu space kind work . arm perspective , server , absolutely . 's whole bunch work many different silicon vendor produced arm part designed big scale thing would put pocket , thing 've put data center . expect time , continue see good distribution . always keep mind x64 workload running bulk stuff today . think 's lot workload future . especially start looking kind cloud-native solution , well . good candidate . think 'll see lot noise 's . thing always keep mind cpu one component cost . 's component . 's one thing pay margin , design around . 's also ram , 's disk , 's whole bunch component , networking , et cetera , go cloud .
