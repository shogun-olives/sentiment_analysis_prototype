great . thank . correct , nvidia definitely great presence overall pc industry many year . several year ago , expansion unique platform really focus . right concentrate four key platform move forward , still concentrated one unique unified overall architecture technology overall single focus visual computing gpu heart . enter four different market , one gaming , gaming pc , gaming mobile . second one enterprise focus design rendering top-end application within workstation also virtualization gpu . third market high performance computing cloud , key market gpu used accelerated mode many parallel application high performance computing . unidentified speaker colette kress unidentified speakerand fourth one , mobile gpu associated automotive industry bringing together infotainment system within car also future ada . four key market . 've seen year really decoupling underlying pc market . first half year , pc market n't strong , actually quite decline saw window 98 upgrade saw window 10 coming second half year . saw business continue extremely healthy . overall , first half year , revenue growth 5 % . concentrated four key market future , four market growing 25 % , one key market growing would gaming . , gaming enter gaming overall pc . 's different kind piece . 's actually platform play . gpu generally looked underlying platform take place pc gaming people buying gpu absolute experience want pc gaming . pc gaming healthy , exciting market right . 've seen move entertainment segment . 've seen actually move almost sport . see coliseum filled overall gamers . , strong relationship gamers surround gpu overall ecosystem put together . working game developer . 're working understand better game want put term feature . work seamlessly gpus 've come . far year date fy16 , overall gaming segment growing 50 % . yes , still based pc underlying platform . overall growth 50 % . split gaming segment reference kind 55 % , 60 % total revenue -- 's correct . colette kress unidentified speaker colette kress unidentified speaker colette kress -- company . oem side well , kind traditionally linked part pc , bunch . even put two together , 're still , math , kind 8 % , 10 % year year , time pc amount . 's still netting positive . two segment , delineate gaming pc versus oem ? yes . think 's important thing look , gpus sell market gaming , mostly done adding card board . n't installed general-purpose pc . even case many one go gaming notebook marketed put gaming overall notebook . tell 're selling oems . complete community overall gamers . see gamers essentially use geforce experience download driver . see game playing . overall community effect , really allowed u differentiate competition also really engage overall gamer term want . lot focused full value getting gpu . great gaming experience possibly $ 99 , $ 100 term buying gpu . also even exciting experience term gaming higher end gpus go $ 800 $ 1,000 . 's high-end gaming box oems make , alienwares , et cetera , categorized ? go -- would definitely gaming -- okay . put gaming side . -- gaming gpu , yes . unidentified speaker colette kress unidentified speakerhow look -- 've talked gaming experience , big gaming event 's million people watching , becomes like bigger watching sporting event launch new movie . view gaming tam growing versus success 've coming market share ? think tam versus share ? great question . 's actually still quite large expanding tam associate gpu community around term game . 've done great job term expanding overall share . 've good percentage share time . 're working adding new gamers becomes social experience . becomes online game group friend , key strategy game playing together . happens addition new gamers really come part social platform . 're also looking area broadband experience , play game , need broadband experience , necessarily available everybody , everywhere world equally . see new part world coming online pc gaming well . also key expansion u . also see expansion performance desire fueled great game coming market need better , higher value gpu well . right , think gpu market discrete , look tam overall $ 4 billion . think overall gaming , need mobility , need cloud gaming experience future , easily could higher $ 50 billion , higher $ 100 billion term amount gaming 's actually occurring . question often get actually occur around world , kind geographic dispersion . part also come think china part answer , console supported china , sort impact -- first geo . second , sort impact whatever percentage give china console adopted potentially ? colette kress unidentified speaker colette kress yes . actually strong market almost every regional area around world . 've seen least last eight quarter one region strong . mean north american market , european market , asia-pacific . china market . normally may one two key actual region , three region quite strong good representative overall revenue . market actually different 's quite bit cultural difference around world . u.s. , game anything many capable different product . pc gaming still one best experience . strong presence , therefore , strong growth . , china , overall pc platform heart home . became piece used gaming used general purpose within home . also icafes big social experience china people actually go meet friend play hour hour term game . unique installed base china established many , many year . emergence console , although , yes , new term legally part world china , necessarily new chinese people . pc experience still ingrained large installed base better experience content available pc gaming kept extremely alive china , even legalization console . two last question gaming side pc aspect . guess first one would oem side , part 's focus company . somewhere around 10 % -ish sale , roughly , maybe little bit le . 's expectation going forward ? yes . 's referring look gaming gpus , tell , , using gpus primarily gaming . still continue sell general purpose enterprise pc general purpose consumer pc . discrete . unidentified speaker colette kresswe 'll compete others market . 's lot different option term general purpose pc . amounted probably le 10 % business right whole company , even looked short maybe two two half year ago substantially much bigger piece business . transformation related [ ph ] establishing key market key . go , 's hard say . think 's still question overall pc start stabilize -- stabilize around zero growth without decline seen ? 'll still compete market . 's say 's strategy . course , see viable business . 're looking let 's make sure see profit need business . guess last question kind nearer-term business question . last quarter , july , guided business weaker , really n't surprise people much given going pc . lo behold actually came ﬂat instead , say 10 % 12 % sequentially . gaming segment made difference . surprised ? going conservative . 's pretty wide delta beginning end quarter . yes . started quarter guidance back may , saw everybody else saw , necessarily focused pc . focused lot macro environment . recall time , european market seen quick rise regarding fx exchange rate . really changed overall buying behavior region . necessarily understanding market would react thing seen , heard watching quite carefully . lot concern term slowdown economy particularly part china say would affect overall business ? still believed overall gaming market healthy strong overall presence . really thoughtful term thinking macro condition . unidentified speaker colette kress unidentified speaker colette kressso happened ? actually finished quarter , yes , gaming market healthy . lot healthier expected , even market condition around . gamers wanted game . great exciting new game . great thing coming horizon . saw great infrastructure innovation put term new gpus maxwell line launched . started testing upcoming virtual reality going right around carter [ ph ] q4 q1 . gamed . excited performance . everything else expected . gaming tremendously stronger thought , really , really demonstrated , yes , transformation worked . really end-to-end player gaming experience allowed u really decouple overall pc market . n't take chance move outside pc area gaming side enterprise side , think , depending quarter , 15 % 20 % sale . 's quadro resides believe grid -- grid . -- well . 's little bit weaker year year late . think mainly enterprise spending-related . talk little bit 's going business growth vector see going forward enterprise . yes . enterprise business definitely line expected . good solid growth following lot enterprise manufacturing side design side many year . macro condition saw first half year put grow-ish situation . still holding tremendous share , still strong application work really go-to gpu lot designer high-end design take place . slight decline , common term saw capital purchasing going around world hold done . 've launched new set board overall enterprise market . come 're really focused design work really taking overall design industry new era , new era rendering prototyping screen nearly real , real overall material may using may longer need actual prototype real material . ca n't even tell term 're seeing term screen . 're excited term new thing 're bringing market really improve designer actually leverage overall gpu . grid business also growing . , , 's coming much overall smaller base . saw tremendous presence vmware vmworld lockstep really demonstrating grid , virtualized gpu sits data center enabling cloud experience access gpu . see much moving application cloud environment . 's extremely important think future . one challenge solved user experience inside . 're looking user experience feel gpu term latency taken care overall screen n't overall stuttering lot application intensive term visual display . 've working vmware continue grow business way around world people see , need term collaborating within workforce . using workstation using application directly installed term pc workstation n't good overall collaborating come 3d type design thing . overall virtualization experience allow everybody access cloud see thing , whether architect job site , whether somebody else 's designing certain part car another part world . really expanding universe term visual effect workstation owner would see . growing . trial reached thousand keep working closing many deal , trial . key project full installment many large company . unidentified speaker colette kress unidentified speaker colette kress unidentified speaker colette kress unidentified speaker colette kress unidentified speakerso enterprise sector whole , enterprise spending , nvidia . stay kind muted economically , sort growth rate think nvidia drive multiyear period refreshes going quadro grid kicking ? still think 's 's opportunity grid really manage grow overall business whole muted . still believe always face period capital may constrained . come time refresh important . critical part job engineer term design . need keep . 'll need additional performance term gpu . 's little hard determine fast grid business grow really kind catch size quadro business . fair say enterprise spending assumption macro-wise . top 's company-specifics , grid -- agreed . -- refresh help almost -- agree -- -- regardless base level ? ( inaudible ) colette kressso , question audience , please raise hand wait microphone . n't transition enterprise side growthier , even faster growing area like hpc cloud ? think 's kind 5 % 10 % sale depending upon quarter 're choosing . talk little bit drove 50 % last year . think 's pretty lumpy business inherently year look little ﬂattish . two year that's still better performance vast majority semiconductor company follow . talk dynamic driving two-year period . sound good . high performance computing cloud , tesla business . refers many year term providing parallel computing , acceleration term within data center key workload , really performance gpu used obviously visual computing . really general purpose compute , taking lot work overall cpu . performance parallel computing capability gpu key term improving time necessary complete several job . saw back fall last year , two key architecture future department energy largest supercomputer world . important locked-in understanding architecture cpu gpu going key supercomputer . 've seen underlying high performance computing continue grow workload expansion using parallel computing . 've also seen couple new segment enter . would side deep learning internet service provider . information traveling network , whether video , whether image , whether voice , key thing internet service provider looking application better serve overall consumer . 're looking ability image detection , voice translation , voice recognition , instantaneously recognize piece , essentially training application image recognition . unidentified speaker colette kressso 've seen internet service provider continue expand using gpus . ? gpus , performance , bar none , one fastest get work done artificial intelligence phase . also ability continue recode , continue reassess overall algorithm nearly perfect identification . driven great growth rate part 50 % growth rate seen last year . lumpy term business 're talking large project internet service provider buying behavior term they've done . continue see entity expansion . expanding ? top researcher , higher education , amount research paper occurring term use gpus leveraging drive acceleration data center continues every single day piece . teach cuda 800 different place around world . using acceleration data center key thing move forward . data center going really expand computing capability acceleration ? see horizon large unique opportunity data center seen pc environment 10 15 year ago . mentioned word acceleration accelerator bunch time . talk little bit inherent advantage , perspective , gpu-based accelerator versus fpga competitive landscape change , , intel intending buy altera . anything 's starting 's many different way skin cat term acceleration . fpgas around quite time , 20-plus year form factor . 's little -- 's different approach . tried work fpgas . gpu term overall performance capability , bar none , one strongest way really release ability data center get job done . fpga could option much lower work level . challenge programmability . gpu , 're generally programming software level , thing familiar , used . fpga , little bit challenging term programming ability . unidentified speaker colette kressas look forward , , 's wide vast arena term data center need acceleration . 're pleased ability serve many important workload right data center . great . , question , raise hand . 'll get mic . n't transition automotive ? probably , size hpc cloud , least today percentage sale kind mid-single digit maybe even moving upper . talk little bit 's driven success . know marquee design win like tesla motor , tesla chip . talk nvidia 's bringing market 's allowed success today today . looking forward nvidia fit thing like ada competing architecture , potentially competing architecture like mobile-i , et cetera . 's right . automotive business , new automotive industry . 've working probably eight ten year inside automotive oems . 've established strong presence many top car see road term infotainment system . center console . also dashboard 're looking user interface really centering digital display see driver . 'll see u audis , bmws , volkswagen golf , hondas , tesla . lamborghinis . super , super high end . 've got eight million car road today . also unique pipeline 25 million car hit road based design already future infotainment system car manufacturer . focus oems working entire ecosystem automotive manufacturing place . tier one . 've established great understanding quality 's necessary , testing . keep coming back additional overall design . see growth automotive seen overall design win . going take u several year term future . that's today . unidentified speaker colette kressthat 's also established u create relationship know coming upon u term future . assisted driving today autonomous driving self-driving car term future . exciting term hot market people getting excited thinking major transformation 10 year ago . technology becoming key part car . focus really want think center computing platform inside car . , similar problem solve term data center . data center complex , structured/unstructured data set . car , talking information around collected via image , collected versus radar , sensor , different piece need processed parallel position . set coding say want instruction ? 's necessarily identifying 's around car , coming set algorithm term want car function go forward . continued milestone along way get autonomous driving . focus type computing platform need u multiple year plug-and-play type form help autonomous driving go forward . 're excited term platform call drive worked 50 different tier one manufacturer , oem manufacturer researcher industry demonstrating capability platform . soon 'll talking design area . see primary competition automotive market ? automotive market , even today , look inside car , 50 different processor . 's competition car , looking different thing . think approach term automotive industry different different competitor . may processor focused antilock brake , necessary 're focused . 're focused leverage best , visual computing side . also center really deep processing power able unidentified speaker colette kressput together future . 's necessarily anybody competing exact manner . think 're looking different approach . different approach term type chip using 're actually solving overall computer problem . many incumbent car many year . n't take chance move financial question last couple minute . one get asked repeatedly licensing side , existing one intel potential duration . also importance defending ip lawsuit samsung qualcomm . talk little bit role defending ip nvidia 's mind strategically expect intel side two reﬂected business model going forward . yes . actually look together . think 's important piece keep mind . currently licensing structure intel . second agreement intel period 've around . expire , capture period end first quarter fy18 . time , discussed couple year ago term importance term defending overall business strategy related overall ip . strong deep patent portfolio 7,000 patent overall probably 700 focused graphic alone . believe probably big lion share lot important patent . overall monetization across mobile arena n't necessarily seen . discussion several year samsung regarding ip piece . note , said probably going take legal court actually solve . year ago went , itc samsung qualcomm infringement . 've gone initial hearing . waiting right judge come first part october give feedback case . likely move overall commission . also give determination court . unidentified speaker colette kress unidentified speaker colette kress unidentified speaker colette kresswe see past term next step . 's likely path . think intel , think itc , think 're together . think lot people looking case , importance case . looking ip , determining next step term graphic architecture licensing . lot color one way early january ? 'll get initial piece beginning october . think 's going towards later part january , beginning february term may see next step . -- finding -- whichever direction turn whomever 's favor , something 's appeal process , next step beyond -- ? , yes . think case law different part appeal side . important case .
