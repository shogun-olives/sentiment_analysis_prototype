'' question , `` well genie put back bottle ? '' answer . disagree . think -- n't think future tv gross rating point cost per thousand demographic . think become lesser lesser factor . think listen message facebook market , people , 's outcome . think tv well environment . think tv take leadership next level measurement . 's lot new company coming measurement , thing . 's incumbent like nielsen , providing nielsen buyer insight , nielsen catalina , proving sale . think 's sale outcome , 're going find tv well positioned help drive currency . steve , specifically around changing currency ? someone 's really forefront currency year , view landscape today evolve ? steve hasker andrew appel craig , two thing 're . first developed total audience measurement system measure piece content , advertising programming , matter seen , . . developed system , launched system , 's place , 's fully functioning . process instrumenting client , client , medium company , agency , advertiser , able see data daily basis . 're happy 's going . 's first part . second part coordinate conduct set conversation buyer seller traditional medium company , digital medium company , agency , update metric . today , national television currency trading metric something called c3 . many case , 's national advertising tv traded . occasionally 's traded seven day . live plus three live plus seven . 've developed system able supersede . question , metric supersede ? 've got capability place move today . need buyer seller agree right metric . anybody think nielsen anybody else wake one morning say , `` good news . 're going move c3 c35 . 're going include device . 're going include dynamic ad information , '' crazy , uproar would cause would tremendous . 're process , pulling together buyer seller help redefine metric headed upfronts next year 's upfronts , new metric reﬂects fact tv content video content viewed across device , 's viewed , different time period . includes ad load , linear ad load dynamic ad load . case , ad load . think challenge scale speed . end , world getting personalized , right ? digital world brought personal , addressable interaction consumer . challenge additional measure metric they're still effectively modeling behavior world world effectively moving real-time addressability scale . think system need , need ability able , scale -- 's one benefit , think , comscore trying -- try scale -- 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 100 million household -- participant somehow play ecosystem allows get census scale-based view individual consumer exposed . challenge think going medium around viewability , fragment , becomes increasingly diﬃcult figure 's exposed . try come another proxy metric sample one mechanism . may work ; may work . system may outgun . craig mineard andrew appelin end , come -- hold , steve -- come -- view 's exposure every person . importantly , impact behavior ? long run , reason create demand , advertising , want create purchase maybe purchase intent . end , 's sale lift . pick one measure would use entire ecosystem advertising , would assert would impact . would n't viewership . viewership mean end . whether 's facebook google simulmedia participant ecosystem , goal ultimately figure every person exposed every person information . 's angle come -- let 's build dataset 100 million household , link rentrak 's 50 million 40 million set-top box . actually able measure conceptually analytic insight standpoint . actual behavior standpoint actual people . actually seeing actually ? system support . move next , ultimately , real-time environment -- 's want , right ? want basically able move real time , look backward happened reinvent next year . 's digital world taught u , want reinvent next minute . right , programmatic view . player basically optimizing viewership . view get sale measure lift impact measure scale , could optimize . andrew , see two complementary solution operating parallel , race finish line winner take ? well think 'll live complement reasonable period time legacy way tv bought . 's ecosystem existed long time upfronts lineality . , system change , secondary system , effectively ability adjust real time exposure individual level based behavior , based see , run parallel . become optimization engine first . , think tv becomes addressable , television becomes addressable , idea sample-based metric-based -- know , 'll end buying inventory based actually change behavior consumer product ? think someday facebook move . know , could get measurement scale , think -- n't know , ca n't speak brad . would imagine would sell inventory based -- steve hasker craig mineard brad smallwood brad jump , suppose slightly different point view evolve term broader measurement space question coexisting measure , craig . believe , point view exposure reach , real benefit single , independent referee field . someone capability scale independence form view many people saw particular piece content particular advertising one period time . also believe top , effectiveness measure , whether basic research measure like brand recall , purchase intent , still important category car purchased cycle 's long , whether 's ultimately andrew 's point purchase , metric become important . however , ca n't get without common view exposure . view need come one place . view need provided independent player , someone 's selling medium someone 's buying medium integrity trust 's required . top , every marketer want slightly different ﬂavor . 're coming simulmedia , 're coming facebook asking different thing . every medium seller want tell slightly different story . think one independent standard effectiveness happen . ca n't see world move away one standard . last comment 'd make compare medium market across world one independent third-party measure compare growth rate medium compared either industry committee sits intermediary multiple metric marketplace , growth rate medium one referee field always higher growth rate n't , like like . brad , someone maybe outside looking . beneficiary measurement targeting forefront lot , would say argument put forth today . advice would give coaching maybe guy focused linear ? well maybe could take slightly different slant . instead focusing measurement answer , 'd focus actual problem , advertiser , like buying medium ? 's effective way mining medium ? look back many year ago , choice craig mineard brad smallwood craig mineard steve haskerwas buy large television show . made total sense 're , 'd buy medium 'd look . increasinglywith digital form addressable tv , 's ability actually buy consumer . buy consumer maybe certain buying behavior ; understand consumer across medium they're consuming . tv , online , together . actually manage buy consumer level instead looking like television , digital , mobile , social -- different silo -- 's actually tying together . think ultimate currency going , least reach measure , need consistency across . bring consistency 's u measuring others measuring , actually third party . steve mentioned , ﬂoats boat within market . actually end really good thing market . see consistency really important part driving overall medium effectiveness . think need become granular time . honestly , like work nielsen 's total ad rating digital ad rating dcr certainly step direction , great . see real line sight cross-platform measurement ? e- marketer article toward end last year think topic ranked extremely highly . yet respondent said n't met today n't coming time soon . 's certainly happening today . end line ? n't think 's end line . 's certainly happening today . tar , 's certainly happening lot campaign going way . think 's lot place still go . 've made major stride last four five year , think , , good entire digital tv ecosystem , know study everybody 's run across medium , people exposed medium across different platform , actually make form medium lot impactful . rising tide lift boat . dave morganyes , one thing 've got look sort study like e-marketer study respondent ? think digital publisher . facebook 's one . digital publisher like tell story size based , andrew 's point based view uniques something . actually calibrate back time attention , 're tiny . benefited wild west many , many metric . think also tv company 're getting price point digital inventory lack supply higher tv cpms . therefore 's level trepidation true cross-platform measurement . 've always go go level beneath look whose ox gored truly move true cross-platform measurement . brad said , 's 've enabled . question fast people move ? answered win loses . craig , think one way think , spent career pure digital world . last seven year pure linear tv world , adult table never got sit tv money . always sat silo metric buyer measurement . never accountable anything else . 's changing . 's changing pretty quickly . 's changing 's massive amount direct measurement brought bear . lot pressure industry . 's pricing model , fact 're worth one-fiftieth much 11.01 watching espn sport center 10.59 moved prime time pretty ridiculous really focusing customer 're buying . 's enough digital back-end digital data , actually start matching lot datasets . mean , nielsen arbitron household start really thinking radio tv work together . think 's going happen going lot change quickly . 're going digital channel work together well . tv going pulled contend everybody else . n't happen . 's going put lot dynamism marketplace . 's going sort nielsen put number . 're going see lot individual company . 've got turner , nbcu , viacom , new effort , great . 's probably going five company upfront press release , 's eight paid company . five . three five press release . 're going see lot different ﬂavors innovation lead change . andrew appel dave morgan andrew appel dave morgan andrew appel dave morgan andrew appel dave morgan andrew appel yes , 'll blend little bit brad said little bit martin said . mean , end , target individual person change behavior perception brand actually something . anything amalgamates audience group , right ? people watching show 11.01 , 3 million people , incredibly different behavioral characteristic . long keep aggregating looking medium big -- ca n't disagree . 's quite different 15 million block . actually , 11.01 , 's probably 1.1 million . actually carrying -- mean , data , 're carrying lot characteristic quite different 400 choice available time . yes . think actual behavioral propensity different . unless get datasets together , 's kind meaning -- dataset scale right tv rentrak data . 's true . data rentrak . data rentrak . 's true . linking actual , know -- -- 110 million household , credit card debit card . granular individual level ? name address . group evaluate across platform ? well none advertiser touch clue ? sense 's -- dave morgan craig mineard andrew appel dave morgan andrew appel dave morgan steve hasker agency n't interest clue . mean , we're working 90 top brand top 250. 're work together . -- 're campaign together right , think . guy exchange business card . . think end state individual level , understand exposure understand impact . everything go interim step . variation extremely high . level accuracy data getting worse , better . agree . -- fragmentation making diﬃcult . agree reach matter , think need know 's actually exposed message understand different behavior behavior change propensity created convert . 're much agreement disagreement . one comment . think much work big data anybody . 've working facebook registration dataset six seven year . 've working catalina loyalty card data period time . 80 % credit debit card purchase , process every day . 's downside . think 've done lot work simulmedia well , big datasets , andrew said , tremendous precision actually producing data . word , people purchase product using cash ? 20 % american cable satellite ? include . 're going representative population , include . brad smallwood craig mineard brad smallwood andrew appelif 're going produce analytics show happens particular person exposed message , 's different task . 's interesting task . think 's good business . happens one spend much time . 's lot fact lot fiction data . 's lot fact lot fiction role different metric produced . think everyone 's fault , including u . think 'm looking forward next 12 month much illumination data source , ca n't combined . purpose serve . think going make , brad 's earlier point , life much easier arguably important constituent conversation , advertiser . one little last piece . 're describing advertising somebody see ad go way process . love brand purchase . happens ad n't happen ad . reality , actual impact ad attribution many different touchpoints advertiser . like ca n't track every impression either convert non-convert . 's always -- 's like complicated modeling go deterministic . 's science . 's deterministic . think careful setting people 's expectation 's measurement , 're going able follow impression way transaction end outcome every time . brad , n't think 's merit chasing dream . holy grail connecting dot . subset audience catch everyone else generic -- 's looking lift 's created . 's always -- 's one person . 's always 're always looking group people understanding , average , like test control kind stuff . wo n't go detail . yes . agree . think 's portfolio exposure individual small segment . mean , 's segment 10 ; 's segment 2 million time . portfolio exposure . analytics need fast enough sophisticated enough able model portfolio exposure experience change behavior . end , datasets today fragmenting quickly , 's becoming diﬃcult figure portfolio exposure . brad smallwood dave morgan craig mineard andrew appel agree 's fragmenting . data integrity issue real . look like cooky , guess digital measure , right , used measure , still . look like actual -- like look cooky operate mobile tie across device , 's complicated process . diﬃcult tie together . see lot conversion disappearing ether . steve 's point data integrity issue real need dealt well . think one thing 's important , living world highly granular data , mean , one thing happened started working nielsen six year ago , got data compared actual viewing data data . 're going show advertising research foundation event , mean , immediately , like , `` oh , god , going embarrassing 're going try shut u contract -- `` found panel held . would expected , actually well mirrored actual viewing . obviously , granularity could see direct viewing . think one thing that's going really critical going integrity panel group people 've got fraud , box , cookie-changing time , component going critical . 'll part . whether center side , measurement going , whether 's going conversion otherwise . know , last thing want supply chain look like ( inaudible ) non-walled garden digital world , 's pollution . feel responsible . built couple company part . 'm conscious time . want leave time q & . given 's number public investor , public company investor room , thought maybe close panel discussion open , go panel . 's company see 's interesting specific theme would want highlight benefit public company investor room , would ? andrew ? well ca n't speak specific thing . keep coming back fragmentation viewability people , audience exposure see . 's company . maybe 's , able pull together scale across platform exposure . impact actual behavior . end , behavior change , sale lift , brand dave morgan steve hasker brad smallwood craig mineardmeasures matter . 's . data look show 's massive amount variation program campaign actual sale lift associated campaign . targeting , work , impact . find company 's , 's highly valuable . well love two public company , way . 'll say . view television ecosystem tv going face lot headwind . matter 's running . matter . mean , would note -- look le moonves last 10 year . mean , made difference . think -- mean , company called -- nbcu . comcast nbcu , twx , turner . viacom -- three taking least pioneering step making massive investment data technology new sale organization sell different kind way . successful , 'll see . look six , even , eight company , 've got three least saying , `` n't want caught bare behind . '' yes , 'll make -- 'm going name specific company . think 'd build dave 's point . think 's acute need leadership tv industry . 's specifically tell story . one trivial example use word tv . n't think quite figure , `` tv video ? '' everyone love video . everyone want invest video company . tv network best video . still best video . probably period time . yet story sexy one 's coherent one across industry advertiser rest ecosystem . think 's one . second one view future . 've invested last five six year , combination highly representative , high-quality , in- person recruited panel , medium exposure measured , tv radio , combined big data . 's one . believe one suﬃciently work . think guy right figured many year ago . one reason started working nielsen also one reason 's accumulated largest repository return path data world . think 'd say 's done proxy combination panel data return path data . 's public -- n't comment specific competitor . say concept buying across different form medium interesting space . think 's lot development . great , thank . let 's jump q & . unidentified participant brad smallwood steve hasker unidentified participant dave morgani wonder guy think term whether wechat gotten closer holy grail able show ad impression actually provide payment track payment , i.e. , run ad say , `` sale went amount '' ? actually ca n't comment directly wechat stuff . think 's great example . think , everyone room n't look , think 's worth looking . problem brad talked , attribution , right ? people wechat also many platform . 're also getting many exposure . 've always got careful metric say , `` spend dollar platform , sale go following . '' add claim , gdp china gdp u , whatever geographic territory , double triple time 11 period time . need multi-touch attribution comprehensive market view . one attribution . mean , tv always seems get slack . new digital ad guy get asked , `` 's roic ? 's roi ? 's roi ? '' tv say , `` hi . 're catching . 're . '' second , 's difference , privacy issue following tracking europe versus u , especially given change ? two disparate question . -- 'll jump first . one reason tv 's behind roi game virtually measurement historically done medium mix marketing mix model , slipped last year . based gross rating point network basis , sometimes broken day part . granularity data . make human judgment . -- n't care , n't prove . unidentified participant ( inaudible ? microphone inaccessible ) held standard digital guy . 's . , , 're , case , 's done channel , channel driving management . mcdonald 's take spend milwaukee 20 point unidentified participant andrew appel steve hasker unidentified participanton tv , lose three point market share week . get yelled put back . held different standard . 's held empirical standard . anyone else want comment , whether 's standard different standard ? know , think standard changing quickly television going held standard digital . think ton mix modeling . think historically , colleague 's point , retroactive . think going forward next 12 month , think attributing impact sale lift measure directly every ad exposure television , 'll end level measure . although may view , roi . think come reach exposure , tv much higher standard digital ever -- much higher , since first day , right ? digital publisher , claim anything , could digital ad rating came along . could claim anything . long n't completely haywire monthly audience estimate and/or server log information , fine . went next campaign . tv , n't hit audience measured nielsen , make good . think point come around attribution , tv historically held accountable move product -- explicitly . dave said , implicitly 's always , whether hard-edged form . digital folk much quicker go . think 're starting see tv folk catch . simulmedia driving lot . dave offer advertiser guarantee make-good based roi number . think seeing player like cbs , campaign performance audit , . difference company leaning independent measure . 're captive metric . 're grading homework . market need go . get everybody point , reach metric accountability metric , whole conversation go away . privacy . craig mineard brad smallwood andrew appel craig mineard unidentified participant brad smallwood unidentified participant want privacy question ? europe versus u , digital , maybe digital might tougher time next 10 year europe . privacy lawyer previous life . would n't operating europe . , n't think -- mean , , 're operating , 're going able operate personalized data business europe . mean , ca n't . wo n't predictability . called cbs one tv company . dave ( holback ) would kill forgotten . cpa measure really strong independent measure . 'd put four public company would mentioned . time one ? one ? talk tracking third-party service able track people , track conversion . seems like facebook real advantage logged-in user . follow across device . straddle line third party coming helping grow overall business versus competitive advantage ? think 's question identity asset 1.59 billion people advantage . steve mentioned , people n't want medium company measuring . question -- 've done dar tar 've done nielsen , company well -- third party come leverage asset order third-party measurement , people n't want u measuring . that's really strategy , using , like enabling third-party measurement using data asset . one last one . wrap . steve hasker andrew appel craig mineardmost conversation affecting causing transaction , yet least business 've , 's awful lot advertising that's done order retain customer , particularly 's recurring revenue stream , well generate brand loyalty , lead transaction line . deal impact advertising -- issue loyalty customer retention opposed transaction ? probably take crack . think 's great question . framework put place number year ago 's picked primary ad sale tool many major medium company provide metric three dimension . firstly , many people campaign reach ? rating . secondly , campaign resonate ? word , basic research metric move brand recall , purchase intent . use neuroscience one measure . brain react message ? last least , andrew 's point , reaction . roi ? consumer go buy product ? fact matter different marketer lean differently three metric . , focused rate reason outlined . others exhaustively focused reaction , actual purchase 're transaction business , fast purchase cycle . many still middle . 'll tell , lot automotive guy still middle they're building brand decade , better worse . recognize campaign , successful , need continue brand . yes , think would add -- set measure build towards every one actual exposure . goal side build real-time measure sale lift , real-time measure impact brand effect , still work progress . think penetration . actual metric intent . auto world , kpi , `` hi . person go visit auto-related site based exposure ? '' becomes measure . idea , one , get cross-platform exposure . portfolio measure available real time every exposure link back modeling science used mix , except real time . , 've got aggregate data one platform able measure real time . adjust , optimize . well thank panel . 'm delighted could get terrific group today . really thank support . thanks audience .
