'll illustrate operates industry vertical . course , tee well rob schlanger whose coming going talk automotive . let start summarizing , really great year datacenter . business tripled compared year ago . $ 400 million quarter . reason -- many reason great year . first foremost , -- first time , launched ai supercomputer , called dgx . dgx-1 first generation . today , jensen introduced second generation . first dgx user group conference , first time ever , actually user group , focusing goodness software go supercomputing ai appliance . many customer presenting dgx story . think 4:30 one -- think 's facebook presenting they're dgx system facebook ai research , 's 4:30 , really good talk go . also launched tesla pascal platform . tesla pascal fantastic year . looked -- tracker oems odm server , right , 506 datacenters server available 43 oems odms worldwide , supporting tesla accelerated datacenter platform server . amazing , five year ago , could count -- barely handful oem odm partner used accelerated computing server . main reason drive growth application , accelerated . today , accelerated application catalog 450 entry . 'll see go around conference many enterprise isvs actually showing talking gpu accelerated application . application drive demand . course , people consider , go on-prem cloud , gpus become available every single public cloud service , whether 's small public cloud like olympics 's running boutique high-performance computing , largest cloud service provider , amazon , aws , ( macwood ) jensen stage short ago . 'm seeing enterprise adopting ai accelerated computing . ca n't go meeting customer , large corporation , large institution , government department talk ai . think week 's economist really nice shot , showing number corporation talking ai earnings release . 's something like 400 company talking -- n't know talk . apparently mention ai really important part strategy . ai enterprise adoption really driving . 'm sharing right side first time growth number customer . started accelerated computing , handful large supercomputing center research laboratory , bleeding edge innovator , people big problem bestest , fastest ﬂops computer , people bought gpu accelerated server , gpu accelerated system . , 8 time many customer . way large customer track track customer . larger one . what's fascinating see breadth depth kind customer buying appliance buying server oems odm partner . see , 8x growth last year . large enterprise . 's pretty interesting u . great year . want summarize though , , 's reason people adopting accelerated datacenter datacenter requirement . , start application . 's , jensen said , accelerate application . ca n't -- ca n't subtract value cpu . worst thing let -- work fine existing cpu , whatever might . accelerate application . today's gdc see thousand developer creating next generation application . turn , go join corporation cloud service company company come software cloud service customer use , right ? 'm showing started top , high-performance computing application . one solving weather earthquake tsunami genomics molecule chemistry quantum physic . application started get accelerated . today , 10 top 10 high-performance computing application accelerated . 're seeing 's happening area ai . ai kind like data analytics 're looking lot lot piece data . data analytics ai framework , data analytics company embracing accelerated computing . saw keynote , sap 's brand analytics . 's analyzing huge amount data , training neural network allowing customer infer much advertising worth particular proposition . okay . sap . 's interesting many enterprise company . developer solving diﬃcult problem , whether simulation problem data analytics problem . apply problem industry solution . 're right 2017. one first customer , oil company , came u said algorithm called reverse time migration . according calculation , 2009 , said year , 2017 , would deploy reverse time migration search oil sea , salt , 's way , 7 mile surface sea . able work optimizing application . delivered production datacenter 2013. 's example take tough problem find solution working developer implement application today , 's called schlumberger omega , application on-premise , cloud , working everywhere 's delivered customer oil gas industry . go approach horizontal platform industry vertical solution , solution government , whether 's defense security cyber security . , solution internet service company , whether 're largest company smaller company like pinterest dropbox ( chingdong ) china's second-largest retailer . vertical go . make solution , industry solution , make sure 's available everywhere . today 's people want choice . want either buy data center system want buy service public cloud . said , 's available everywhere . 's kind strategy . 's . strategy action . let show , work 3 major category accelerated datacenter . first classic one , accelerated , high-performance computing . best way think market top 500. today , 1.2x exaﬂops installed top 500 system . oak ridge national laboratory , riken national laboratory , china 's largest supercomputing center . forth . 's 500 . coral , going nation , united state ' fastest supercomputer , predicting next year , 'll 1.7x exaﬂops , 1.7x exaﬂops 1.2x top 500. that's one interesting data point . think nation said , -- going exascale . every continent , every country , every subsegment high-performance computing , whether 's weather , earthquake , climate , want need genomics , need reach exascale . postulate maybe first exascale computer somewhere 2020 2022. year later , 'll exascale computer . work somewhere -- year 2020 , 8 exaﬂops computing top 500. , course , calculate number process price paid exaﬂop computing . turn , best calculation point time $ 4 billion . last year , said , market probably opportunity $ 3 billion nvidia . 'm convinced , based application , better value delivered , reach indeed , look , problem getting bigger , problem getting bigger . think opportunity $ 4 billion . people buy accelerated system ? 's molecule convened modeled faster . 's 273 nanosecond computing that's going done amber supercomputer . whereas previously , used 7 nanosecond . protein interacting know protein going interact body . classic jac benchmark . see cpu-only , non-accelerated system , 19 rack computing done 1 rack pascal p100 . word , saving $ 13 million per instance . saving huge customer . reason 's single high- performance computing rfp , request proposal , require number accelerator gpus . many specify 100 % acceleration see future , application accelerated . want buy something 's going last 3 five year research community , make sense go all-in acceleration . 'll give example . national -- national center supercomputing application , ncsa , hosted uiuc , university illinois urbana- champaign blue water . time , 2012 , decided , 27,000 node , would 5,000 node accelerated 1 gpu , 1 gpu per node . sort -- well , turn saved 20 million hour computing would otherwise done gpu . 's interesting thing . , point time , decided go richer number gpus ncsa blue water , turn , instead saving 20 million hour computing , would saved 50 million hour computing . 's amazing -- even , application run cpu system . obviously need cpu-only . beauty , time , value supercomputer actually increase application accelerated . 's interesting market right every single high-performance computing center embracing ai . riken , japan 's national laboratory , host third-fastest computer world , 's called k computer , 24 rack dgx-1s run ai supercomputer . 's fastest currently available facility japan ai research community . japan made huge commitment improving ai research base . titech , run tsubame supercomputer , announced third generation . 've always nvidia gpus . third generation japan 's fastest ai supercomputer probably fastest ai supercomputer world 's installed , shortly . reason put saturnv , supercomputer , 's # 28 top 500 right . important thing saturnv , besides really , really good ai deep learning machine , 's # 1 green 500. came within whisker magic number 10 gigaﬂops computing per watt energy . simply eﬃcient , energy-eﬃcient computer planet .

( presentation ) okay . good afternoon , everyone . video today , far , largest generative data . approximately 75 % internet traﬃc video . across many city world , 's hundred million camera , traditionally surveillance purpose , capturing data storing 24/7 . camera deployed government building , traﬃc intersection , transportation hub like airport train station , mall , oﬃces , school , name . many camera deployed safety reason first , traditional public safety application like video surveillance , law enforcement , forensics . 're also seeing increasingly used eﬃciency smart city reason , people call smart city , essentially using video camera use thing like traﬃc management , retail analytics , foot traﬃc mall intersection . also optimizing resource . ai city safe city smart city . using power deep learning , actually take billion video frame , anonymize transform meaningful insight . ai city . mentioned , several hundred million dollar camera already deployed today . another half billion camera going coming online next 3 four year . end approximately 1 billion camera stream 24/7 2020. today , 's happening camera stream basically 're going video recorder . small fraction video stream watched human being extreme sensitive safety area . otherwise , 're basically going recorder . something bad happens , somebody go review fact . want solve problem using human , imagine , 30 billion frame day , basically take 3 billion 8-hour work shift . 's really practical problem . past 10 year , video analytics solution proposed solve . problem video analytics past , challenging real-world condition , accuracy never really good enough . 's much inferior human being false alarm actually bigger issue really trying solve problem . power deep learning ai , 've seen many , many industry application . use deep learning solve problem . achieving ai city , safe city smart city power deep learning . let 's look -- architecture ai city look like . turn actually need edge cloud architecture solve problem . show picture -- first , 's camera installed everywhere , right ? could body camera police oﬃcer . could camera that's deployed parking entrance , garage 's basically building , looking license plate . would nice camera actually ai-enabled . take one level higher . imagine airport . 've got hundred camera , maybe even 1,000 camera . , 'd want actually capture data together . sort application , happens across camera matter , right ? example , imagine 're looking viewpoint camera . 's happening 100 foot away probably relevant 's happening viewpoint . example , lost child , want track , done across camera . also equally important across time . happened 5 minute ago probably relevant 's happening right . , actually powerful , on-premise server appliance going taking ten hundred camera analysis . 's on-premise server . take city scale way . basically 're talking cloud infrastructure , 're getting data across multiple precinct block . want full public safety , like city center , looking different area . want optimize resource across city , traﬃc pattern look like something -- sort safety reason , something bad happening , would able look alternate route . really solve problem , need ai , edge . also cloud also on-premise server . 've announced earlier week platform . 's called nvidia metropolis , wherein apply different nvidia product across board , way edge cloud . 've heard earlier talk also obviously know , 's 2 piece ai deep learning . first piece training creating neural network . 's happening typically cloud . dgx-1 . train neural network , deploy network . 's called inferencing . deployment happen even cloud on-premise server way edge ( access ) camera . created platform using software stack starting cuda . top , unified different software development kit ai create singular platform intelligent video analytics bring ai city . 's metropolis platform . typical installation camera , video recorder server , appliance on-premise . -- 're using tesla platform high- end server jetson platform high-end camera small recorder 's typically taking 4 channel 8 channel . actually , time , expo ﬂoor , classic example law enforcement , police car , future police car would look like , wherein police car camera front side body cam police oﬃcer . there's amber alert , today happens basically police oﬃcers looking something . capture something , 're going go back dump data server shift . instead , 're showing expo area using power ai process camera stream real-time . whether 's detecting car , license plate , face body cam . actually prevent , hopefully , prevent something bad happening opposed fact . started journey couple year ago , started working partner space . last year , first time , ai-enabled server even high-end camera started proof concept ai city , smart safety application . approximately $ 10 million revenue last year . projecting next year would $ 100 million revenue . inferencing opportunity either on-premise server , appliance high-end camera . even growth , 10x growth expect last year next year , bulk camera still going ai-enabled . think , mentioned , 's 500 million camera stream right . almost none ai-enabled . many camera going deployed year next year . many still ai-enabled . 're still early phase transforming human watching video stream going recorder transforming deep learning , real-time video analytics . even next year , think le 5 % total stream , cumulative stream would ai-enabled . going calendar year 2020 , think nvidia opportunity $ 2 billion . basically , even , number stream would increase term much ai going enabled . increasingly , network capability ai also going increase . focused primarily on-premise server , like thing go -- process ten , hundred , thousand channel on-premise environment like airport train station building like . 's server . 're also focused thing like small recorder also high-end camera . think 's going $ 2 billion opportunity u , growing fairly fast , coming proof concept last year . ai city platform , metropolis , already 50 platform partner 've announced -- announced product engagement u . many actually gtc showing product . many actually started shipping product well . example see . , 've working traditional video analytics colette m. kressfor almost decade . using deep learning ai , within year could increase accuracy significantly , going 70 % , 80 % 90 % . soon expect increase significantly . traditionally video analytics done , obviously , traditional server . 're seeing significant speed- ups , like double-digit order magnitude , double-digit , 10 30x type speed-up using nvidia gpus appliance . list 50-plus partner . reason show partner , many might recognize name . industry pretty fragmented industry . many , many vertical space . many , many geography require different solution . order address market , decided go platform strategy . many small customer make ecosystem . end-to-end platform , way training inferencing , edge cloud , providing sdks working different partner launch partner . okay . 's basically tell ai city . , 's pleasure invite colette , cfo nvidia , give next presentation . okay . good afternoon . , feel like finished talking . oh , 's right , . right . last night got opportunity speak earnings . really appreciate 're today keynote morning well investor day .

's even logical . question n't whether -- industry , world need computing . real question architecture would become ? 's really greater question . think long time , know , believe accelerated computing . personally believe competent cpu . competent cpu connect competent gpus , result actually pretty remarkable . prefer architecture . think 're going , time , continue see opportunity processor . new computing architecture . vivek arya bank america . thanks informative analyst day . actually one clarification . think , colette , started talking operating margin . wanted make sure 're still committed expanding operating margin ? understand need investment . wanted understand think margin expansion . real question , , datacenter . think convinced u training market actually bigger think , 's one-off , lot leg . inference still going bigger market . fact leading training , give advantage kind somebody train moved inference stage , likely use gpu ? think still easy move alternative architecture . sustainable advantage come inference also ? said something earlier -- term commitment , let answer question . 're investing opportunity . 're committed investment . reason believe , ca n't commit -- believe margin expansion . reason believe margin expansion believe top line opportunity grow faster investment . 're committed investment . believe see margin expansion . one game , one score . ca n't play score . want clarify . believe enjoy market -- margin expansion , enjoy margin expansion . top line -- revenue growing fast . -- made statement earlier believe true . 's , okay ? statement inferencing larger market . 's . reason 's larger unit , 's larger computing . reason take trillion cycle train billion parameter otherwise known neuron weight . take trillion cycle train billion weight . trillion large number . trillion large number , know . inferencing inference billion . notice 's trillion factor training . get trillion , billion , inferencing billion , right ? got inference either million people simultaneously hit internet infer something network trillion device . happens , true . look total inferencing market today , believe 's approximately small . okay ? 's 's inferencing company know . talk lot q - atif malik - jensen hsun huang q - srinivas reddy pajjuribecause 's sexy conversation . fact matter 's evidence . going lean , think 's time people going start taking network 're going start deploying datacenters . 's decided make volta pretty killer inferencing machine . mean , 's chart . somebody would like build something better , first principle 's pretty hard . really , really hard . question becomes $ 2.5 billion r & budget pick number , $ 0.5 billion r & budget go build processor approximately market moment ? well turn . reason processor day job . guy understand ? 's waiting around inferencing night shift . moment , day job game away , train away , hpc away , workstation away . , inferencing market come , 're going right . 's magic work , 's equation work . inferencing start-up company today , 'm going chasing dollar long time . pretty rough . 'm suggesting people n't start company . think people ought start company . lot . atif malik , citigroup . question gaming . 'm little bit surprised pascal refresh upgrade rate 17 % . look gaming decline guy saw last reported quarter , 24 % , little bit kind seasonal regard peer . trying better understand guy think back half year term gaming demand ? longer-term , showed 6 % 7 % compound annual growth rate , believe , third party . think rate versus customer like msi taiwan talking 20 % year-over-year gaming sale growth year ? yes . guess , 'll -- number showed term overall market , $ 100 billion software revenue . 's kind strength , ecosystem overall gaming . gaming hardware growing faster . especially notebook . mentioned msi big notebook customer . 're one early , guess , leader term pushing form factor performance notebook space . think , pascal really kind turbocharged hardware , gaming hardware market providing step performance . think year good year gaming hardware . 'll see seasonality . end market appear fairly robust u looking forward . fundamental covered , esports , aaa gaming , type thing look continued momentum year . srini pajjuri macquarie . thanks presentation . jensen , question competition . obviously , 're game town datacenter right . look , got amd graphic , intel variety solution got internal solution well fpgas . maybe talk put take look competitor ? also 're concerned , longer-term ? - jensen hsun huang first , answer competition question , could figure -- 's competitor game , got figure game 're playing . used different sport franchise . nascar business past . race around 490 lap last 10 lap chaos . think 's work , right ? eat pizza first 490 lap . -- game really different today . much marathon . 's really -- really play -- play long game . long game 've done selected market going take least 10 year happen . market existed . pc graphic chip existed . competed rigorously . 'm really happy . really felt refinement execution system company , speed company , intense competitive nature company really honed . ca n't successful nascar . people audience tracked u long time . chose nascar kind started like . -- n't know many car nascar start . 150 company u lap . chaos . chaos . remained . precision company , ability really hone art high level . today , 're playing long game . selected market , large . 're far . far market software intensive . nothing window , 's got nothing industry standard , 's got nothing component . 's really software problem . invested course last 10 year , massive amount software . 're software company today . 're software company today . 's could , one hand , solve ai computing problem like nobody . hand , create self-driving car . hand , could train robot alternative universe . 're software company . ca n't -- graphic chip n't . gave graphic chip , could put stage say , `` train robot . '' wo n't . sit like graphic chip . -- boot window . think company different company today . compete different people different market . believe really 2 platform today self-driving car , u intel . believe -- different approach . different approach . n't -- think long-term $ 10 trillion market , going 2 platform people choose . architected differently . case ai , question people want take battle ? ai going huge . going future software . 's going future computing . strategist , would n't take game . would take different part ai , go endeavor new frontier n't focus . competitor ai really expansion market . market expand fast enough , investment level becomes high , right ? mean , we're investing high -- , , hard . would like market expand . fortunately , market expanded quite nicely . 's imperative u . 's one reason much thing called deep learning institute . teach deep learning world . partner microsoft , partner google , partner company coming u help educate world 's deep learning engineer . 're going educate 100,000 engineer year . would like create future engineer take advantage new art form , q - mitchell toshiro steves - jensen hsun huang q - toshiya harithis new computing way . also want make sure end point , end point , completely democratize ability inferencing , point open-source . open-source design . 've got world's best engineer building world 's best cpu basically , open-sourced . reason want proliferate quickly possible consumption network side . sooner somebody put dla lamppost , fantastic . somebody put speaker , fantastic . would like expand market . competitor core ai market consumption , unlike lot company building long-term . point , course , take 're starting experience . different different market . mitch steves , rbc . 2 question . first datacenter side . seems like implied message ai actually probably going faster growing piece . 's case , mean essentially 's growing faster 186 % saw latest quarter ? secondly automotive side . one case 'm hard time understanding 've trained car , prevents moving something like dsp , lower powered chip , know drive versus using gpu ? welll , first , dsp way le eﬃcient gpu . ca n't imagine deep learning dsp . ? see 'm saying ? mean , something dsp particularly think ? 're 2 different 3-letter acronym . gpu least benefit tensor instruction , dsp n't , right ? dsp actually good time sequence , digital signal processing , 's use audio . deep learning massively parallel problem . array matrix multiplies , want really happen almost simultaneously . think gpu actually quite uniquely wonderful . architecture really quite uniquely wonderful . add deep learning finesse . add deep learning data format , deep learning specific instruction . actually included deep learning computational array right cuda . cuda cuda 9. cuda one computing architecture 's quite extensible . 've extending since beginning . every single year , add new thing . one architectural innovation started beginning company 's really carried 'm proud invested . think way think xavier designed deep learning inferencing ai computing car scratch . 's purpose- built . people n't use xavier car , 're likely use coffee machine . 're going -- xavier n't work car , 're going use cell phone , example . 's helpful , 's dedicated one thing , run entire software stack self-driving car . toshiya hari , goldman sachs . thank much opportunity today . think provided long-term tam forecast business gaming . jeff , think ran growth driver collectively group , - jeffrey d. fisher - jensen hsun huang - unidentified speaker - jensen hsun huangappreciate . help u translate growth driver actual number next , say , 3 five year , would much appreciated . well n't specific tam graphic . think look total pc market . area 're investing , platform , 's little hard put upper bound . geforce , example , get u outside -- get u outside traditional market . 're adding value moving value chain term 're providing gamers . total software tam $ 100 billion -- jon peddie say hardware tam $ 30 billion . 're monitor g-sync . guess 's hard put specific tam tie back business today . n't know would -- -- want add ... three billion people . 's would done . three billion people . believe , tenure , -- -- arc career , another 50 year , believe 'm healthy , enjoy job . 's plenty . 50 year , believe 's question mind , every human become gamer . think 's -- 's logical . 's reasonable . every human watch television . parent 's generation , 10 % probably . generation , give example one n't . mean , 's hard find . 's another form entertainment . difference , course , form entertainment computationally intensive . therefore , delivery vehicle , delivery medium hard , reason cartridge look like supercomputer . geforce cartridge look like supercomputer . step-by-step-by- step 're solving problem able provision service virtualized way . 's going still take u several year . fish mentioned , geforce created reach everyone . long-term , question many gamers world 's top -- world 's top fundamental gaming platform provider ? almost rule 're . -- almost say absolute certainty , one . think everybody room would say , yes , pretty -- yes , would go along . pretty darn sure 're going one platform maker gaming someday . kind hard imagine n't . 3 billion -- 3 billion , many serve ? serve ? sure . absolutely going table ? absolutely sure . 's strategy made . okay , everyone , last question . 's like -- 're much fun . hosting reception management team right last question . q - matthew d. ramsay - jensen hsun huang - colette m. kress - jensen hsun huang q - ambrish srivastava - jensen hsun huang 's matt ramsay canaccord . n't know shankar jensen guy want take . 's great thing company guy one common gpu platform across business 've seen benefit . 're currently able generate significantly higher asp piece business , think , particularly datacenter . think 's justified benefit customer get . want ask little bit , get scale tam guy laid , feel pricing datacenter space ability segment product portfolio move forward . perspective going forward ? first , idea pricing somehow higher certain segment right . reason : think cost wrong . think cost wrong . nvidia 's cost chip . 's chip , 's least cost . -- chip cost , cd rom microsoft 's cost . software company . 're information company . cost human cost . 're variable . chip variable . sometimes inventory , sometimes le inventory . engineer employed everyday . 's really cost . think perspective , datacenter business pretty high cost . cost much , much higher per unit geforce , example . geforce sell ten million , datacenters n't . yet 're investing real number advancing datacenters . cost different . want let -- one business , think first principle business model . make business work 's price accordingly . far 'm concerned , frankly think -- well , operating margin geforce , obviously , quite good . let 's see question . food drink . -- n't know . little overrated food drink , keep question . sound good ? shawn 's like investor police . ambrish bmo . thank , jensen . laid vision ai pretty compelling , 've never doubted . wanted move mundane topic like ar inventory free cash ﬂow . augmented reality ? 's mundane . come . let 's talk . q - ambrish srivastava - colette m. kress q - brett simpson - jensen hsun huang touch well . colette , account receivable going back last night , n't get chance ask question . account receivable , 18 % q-over-q 11 % . even year-over-year basis , pretty large increase . inventory going well . help u understand expecting ar well inventory go forward ? let highlight ar . ar always inﬂuenced term timing new product . whether 're beginning quarter , whether 're middle quarter , whether 're end quarter . there's never issue term collection . team n't really look end month like . shift think need . necessarily concerned timing term ar . inventory . 've talked couple thing morning coming important term part inventory . look understand term inventory , 's probably 1/3 quarter inventory . significant amount business front u . business term datacenter , many different architecture continuing sell , well gaming business , well automotive business . reality inventory level size company actually quite reasonable , actually low . enough term ? , feel comfortable . probably key thing timing within . 'm concerned . brett simpson arete research . couple 2-part question datacenter . first , jensen , wanted get perspective cpu . 're accelerating lot workload , 've always hosted xeons , particularly deep learning training . interface cpu gpu obviously holding back system performance . question , circumvent xeon , particularly work 've done nvlink power9 , n't develop cpu license power9 instead ? 've got follow-up . well power9 really fantastic cpu , 's question . work 've done power9 , well , single-threaded processor , unparalleled . 's great processor . hand , hand x86 ecosystem really rich . mean , 's lot -- body work top x86 intel architecture quite rich . use product . use develop software . run -- nvidia run x86 , run intel . 'm ashamed . 's great processor . select good one . term datacenters , think datacenters use intel energy eﬃciency good . mean , fact matter , craftsmanship intel xeons great practically people -- n't know one going violate rule 'm say , okay ? n't know anybody could actually give cpu q - brett simpson - jensen hsun huang q - trip chowdhryaway free company still lower total cost ownership intel . say something craftsmanship . single-threaded software , single-threaded code completely gone world , likely , likely , intel xeons fantastic . 's use . circumvent pci express kind technique , kind technique . -- intel 's also advancing pci express gen 4 . i'm comfortable connection . okay . follow last question datacenter pricing . mean , clear 've got value-based sell talked saving offer customer replacing cpu gpu acceleration . scale gpu business , particularly large hyperscalers concentrated set buyer going forward , given big public cloud becoming , guess , 're approaching $ 100 million year gpu compute , guy today . look next 2 three year , 're going buying lot product guy . sustainable think current pricing 're getting gpu specific set customer ? first thing save money . save million dollar . save million dollar way n't possible without ecosystem we've built application 've ported . shankar said , top 450 hpc application planet ported . get ported every day . richness ecosystem allows able accelerate application , reduce cost . reduce cost investing couple $ 100,000 save 10 -- save $ 2 million server probably $ 1 million cable , okay ? 's math . 's math . event 're able -- event n't run kind application , 0 % -- 're 0 % successful . basically either help people save million dollar , n't get considered opportunity , even little bit . 's nothing . 's nothing . 's pricing largely non-matter . ecosystem come along software spec come along . hear , 's going fine . we've invested company close $ 10 billion gpu computing . long , long gpu computing value , carrying cuda chip shared memory dragging gross margin decade . question -- 's got ecosystem , mentioning earlier , conviction go build ecosystem got u . secondarily , investment 're making today richness ecosystem software stack allows application decrease cost . application ported accelerated , ca n't benefit , okay ? think -- 's nothing -- mean value exchange 2 organization fantastic . , quite frankly , year breaking even investment , . - jensen hsun huang q - trip chowdhry - jensen hsun huang q - unidentified participant - jensen hsun huangtrip chowdhry global equity research . two quick question . first know new industry evolving emerging , positive , shift cpu-native database gpu-native database , especially columnar database . company booth . question , driving sdk anything else ecosystem grow ? 's number one . second question ... yes . okay . little slight detail , 'll come second question , like , sdk 're giving benchmark . giving ? nvgraph , cublas , cudnn , cuda . -- whole bunch software engineer help optimize software . think industry take ? two year ? three year ? 'm sure . 's know . graph analytics one important thing could . sea dark data sit company . -- idea turn unstructured , messy data something reasonable . could take data plummet directly todd mostak 's mapd , 'm process , way . okay ? could take goop ram one dgxs running mapd , 's going go figure , 's going figure -- little bit software , 's going go figure relationship everything everything else . result , create corporate graph , 're going essentially corporate facebook , except 's people , 's thing . 'll able find interaction relationship , trend way people amazing graph . believe everybody 's going . believe everybody 's going . 's going say sql database hadoop database , place . 's people really want harness -- take data underground really use apply graph optimization analytics apply ai , people really going want . think company like walmart ge people lot data , find relationship going need . say enterprise database going go away . high-performance computing going come . think today , 's really serving file maintaining number employee number part number dollar kind thing . erp system today , 's . 's new town hpc . department enterprise n't understand yet . . hpc coming start in-memory database , high- performance graph analytics , deep learning ai top , machine learning q - james wang - jensen hsun huang q - stacy aaron rasgonon top , 're coming . think 's going future , really . yes , young man ? saw tv day . made proud . james wang , ark invest . jensen , talked open-sourcing xavier . thought surprising radical announcement 've seen guy long time . maybe talk u thought process , going r model , qualcomm model ? going able download blueprint xavier ? ? 's revenue model . previously , 've talked ip line business . involved ? fit together ? kind went like , think open-source xavier dla . guy think ? everybody go , `` damn , 's right . . '' took , like . mean , james , know decision get made . 's sit around talk . problem 're trying solve accelerate expansion adoption deep learning ? lot asic company n't know deep learning really work right . see mathematics . see . n't know end end . n't know design end end . many market 're never going design product . 're never going . 's -- believe there's going trillion , trillion deep learning chip , little tiny tpu thing asics going sprinkled like dust world . 're going go build thing . 're going go build refrigerator chip . somebody . 're going go build coffeemaker chip . somebody . 're going go build , right , microphone chip . somebody . want make possible people going build , without without u , able build using ip , using ip created 's really supereﬃcient . 's already baked . pull deep learning go-to- market couple 2 , three year . couple 2 , three year . thought , expansion deep learning market would help one conversation earlier competitor worry . question competition . told , competition nonconsumption . well competition nonconsumption , n't cry . something . 2 thing nonconsumption . invested deep learning institute . call dli . invested deep learning accelerator . called dla . 're making 2 available fairly affordably . case dla , 's open- sourced , 's royalty . royalty . take use write home . mostly expand market . yes ? stacy rasgon bernstein . talked customer investing hundred thousand stave $ 10 million . guess light , view rise accelerated compute helping increase overall spend compute ? mechanism better utilize gain eﬃciency spend 's already ? guess , put another way , think opportunity -- think opportunity benefiting shift architecture term - jensen hsun huangof current spend actually going versus ability -- need actually increase overall spend compute today ? yes , sean ( sic ) ( stacy ) , 's great question . fact , look almost exactly like market adoption curve new technology somehow radically different past . movie saw time look exactly like . first customer adopt technology adopted technology choice . needed simulate something fast ca n't get done , research grant run money . 're job . one researcher told work . invited lab see supercomputer . say , '' jensen , work , 'm able life 's work lifetime . '' imperative , n't know . choice . need time machine choice . need warp speed . second group second generation people used gpus , possible way . crazy nut cost prohibitive . let give example . titan , oak ridge titan financially possible without gpus . choice . budget much money choice use accelerator . 's first take big chance . jeff nichols , quoted volta , 's probably . jeff nichols took massive chance move one nation 's open science supercomputing center accelerated computing nobody thought time . huge chance . big courageous move . soon , course , everybody else discovered problem . n't enough money . ca n't build datacenter large enough . datacenters supercomputer , get awfully large . ca n't build facility large enough , ca n't provision power , impossible provision power . simply n't enough money . reduction size , compression talking earlier , future architecture look like , reduction size , compression everything money saved allowed create supercomputer worthy built . remember , way go get grant $ 0.5 billion say , `` hi , would like build supercomputer 's almost fast 900 top supercomputer planet . '' 's way . build something meaning build something allows deliver capability nation . 're second-generation . third-generation , simply new idea would n't possible new technology , deep learning . new generation researcher jumped top platform . great idea . would practical probably someday . n't gpu , would n't practical today . jumped gpu like crazy . 're seeing -- largest market . , , people called tipping point , people called mainstream market , . code ported start going mainstream , everybody look go , `` need run code list 10 application run . based architecture , cost much money , throughput 10 application . based architecture much cost . throughput . '' 's spreadsheet . 's simple . , get 1 2 answer . constant spend , meaning got budget . got spend $ 10 million . n't know got . got . , would like highest throughput . event 're q - stacy aaron rasgon - jensen hsun huang - colette m. kress - shawn simmons - colette m. kress q - unidentified participanttrying deliver throughput customer 're budget conscious . would like figure way spend le money , save money . basically 2 type customer shankar deal today . want increase throughput budget ? want deliver throughput lower budget ? part market quite large . 's 're experiencing today . long-term , long-term , believe . next phase . next phase exact thing 've enjoyed pc , mobile device . first got -- first showed , everybody go , `` nah , $ 700 ? think 's going high-end segment . 's really business executive luxury computing , example . '' remember back good old day pc first came go , `` yes . 's market probably , n't know , 100,000 ? '' 're going see -- 're seeing thing . turn , provide capability , something like deep learning . find value power automation automation . use . realize much productivity unleashes company , i.e . save money . 're going buy . really believe : reason much confidence expand -- market , market computing going continue expand , market , expansion computer industry applying machine learning going cause u reduce spend area like ca n't believe . 'm certain . waste transportation , waste container , waste warehousing , waste parking lot , waste fossil fuel , waste , name . 're going reduce waste . waste time , waste people thing . 're going reduce waste . way 're going 're going shift spend computing capability company . 's next phase , expansion market . hopefully , 'll enjoy differently one phase . sean ( sic ) stacy , answer question ? 's good question . think , went marketing 101 business -- revolutionary business 101. 's stacy . yes , think answer right . 'm sorry . thanks , stacy . get one last one , okay , get shawn ? award give . , yes . - jensen hsun huangthis question autonomous driving . jensen , said earlier 're 2 platform , intel . assume mean also mobileye . also said 's going big market . question think approach might superior , maybe summarize different approach , different approach . 's going tell u approach might get bigger portion market think 5 six year whether going winner-take-most ? well two appraches different . -- approach based computing approach processor programmable . know cuda architecture , computing architecture gpu . dla programmable architecture everything context computer . 's reason 240 , 200 company able take computing platform add value . also first realize , realized deep learning right way go , three year rest market . 've building deep learning platform xavier everything based deep learning . traditional computer vision hand-coating go along . 'm suggesting 's solution work , 's know 's robust , 's diverse , 's able handle condition . require data data available . criticism deep learning past largely vaporized either maturity workﬂows maturity engineer , well creation processor dedicated one thing , called xavier . xavier world 's first processor designed one job . 's optimized job . n't drive trouble , n't know type . sucker designed one job one job . high risk/high return strategy . course moderated risk built entire stack . understand software well . owned software , see software . 's moderated risk . 's pretty high risk . nobody semiconductor company . would n't know nuance went xavier . approach combination custom asics computer vision . traditional computer vision chip . deep learning capability future . largely still computer vision chip . fpgas surround couple general purpose cpu . think two approach , one based aii computing platform rather coherent opinion . one collection integrated chip cobble enough capability . tow approach different . result choice , computing platform programmable , meaning start-up could actually get drive px2 make attempt program . q - unidentified participant - jensen hsun huang - colette m. kress - jensen hsun huangyou ca n't acutally one . acrhitecture , actually large car company take computing stack add differentiation . ca n't approach . 's difference , 're going find success . 'll find success . ( indisceernible ) validates approach ? well 200 company validated approach know one conservative company world , 're slow , 're careful , done detailed analysis imagine , toyota chosen drive px . ehy choice everything . tell something . term ratio , 's 74/26 . , would like close ? 's always good goal . okay , well guy , extraordinary time , thanks time 've spent u . attention 're paying company . really honored . thanks investor room .
