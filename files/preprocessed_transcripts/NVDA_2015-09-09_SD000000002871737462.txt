've even saw first 2 quarter fiscal year -- overall revenue growth company first 2 quarter 4 % 5 % . - sean vocke - colette kress - sean vockebut actually pull growth platform focus , growth rate nearly 25 % . concentration market working , 've really decoupled saw underlying pc market , growth market several quarter . really concentrating building business go forward . question answer right . thanks good introduction . guess , n't start largest opportunity guy , gaming . maybe help u understand big gaming business guy today . expectation , far long-term growth ? yes . gaming business u half overall business -- $ 2 billion , concentrated pc gaming . also strong attraction gamers across world . concentrated actually one geography . strong representation u , european market , well asia pacific even china . overall china business represents good percentage overall gaming market well . strong hold pc gaming time . think future people think sizing overall pc gaming , 's kind interesting 's perfect understanding big . underlying platform nothing gpu provide . provide set tool , set driver , set software , connects directly overall software 's coming onto market , actual game hit market , people keep coming back buying overall gpus . look -- 's outside resource looked , way 2018 growth market . probably -- thought near double- digit type growth . fast grow period time ? continued innovation , continued work developer gaming market , would probably key . 're excited growth . okay . thanks . look gaming business , see biggest driver business ? macro ? new game launch , like call duty -- metal gear ? -- new hardware , right ? like , skylake refresh , example . - colette kress - sean vocke - colette kress - sean vocke - colette kress well confusion game actually drive gaming market . game continued advance last several generation -- high- caliber , high-production-value game continue come . even last quarter , probably two key game drove significant amount gaming time leveraged overall gaming platform . see gaming volume continue , probably getting ready holiday season . that's important . underestimate power underlying platform hardware . hardware put together key feature gameworks we've worked software developer enable . hard thing water ; fire ; hair movement -- type thing . feature allow game look realistic , though game real , important underlying gamer . work . innovation , key producing . time time , gamer population come back know innovation going right -- upcoming game thing developed market . sure . sense large gamer market today . percentage pc versus non-pc gaming ? gaming pc probably largest overall platform gaming market . gaming occurs every single different platform , though . everybody could form using overall gaming . stem pc . stem console . tablet ; phone ; lot mobility term need [ ph ] . high-caliber , strong gaming platform found pc , one popular . 'll even find people gaming pc platform well console . pc continued higher echelon overall gaming performance . right . look pc gaming base , largely concentrated u ? asia ? europe ? maybe talk little bit -- yes . great thing , 's world . u , love working multiple different platform . pc gamers console gamers , lot . - sean vocke - colette kress - sean vocke - colette kressin asia-pacific china , china love overall pc platform gaming experience . european -- also strong hold lot higher-end pc gaming well . 've seen far last several quarter , strength across different market , growing quite nicely around world . okay . thanks . look graphic business , much success attribute , guess , solution versus share gain competition ? true duopoly discrete gpu . gamers set gamers continue consistently come back overall gaming population . discrete gpu , percentage market -- 're looking market share close 80 % . driven platform , platform gaming . platform even regular pc general oem . overall gamers u long time . small gain amd . lion 's share driving overall growth . overall value deliver platform . continuing maintain strong asp period time . getting gamers continue upgrade higher-performer gpu , main driver overall gaming revenue . overall gamers across world continue expand . gaming take place strong broadband capability . still many part world broadband still coming life . see gamers wanting master also available sister country . get expansion people entering pc gaming . get gamers continue upgrade higher version . really maintaining value asp , driving majority overall revenue growth . sure . remind u asp done last year two ? asp , remarkably , grown period time . average asp gaming gpus continues go upward . 'll still concentrate focus . focus -- price . focus delivering value term platform . - sean vocke - colette kress - sean vocke - colette kress - sean vockethen obviously 's lot press lot coverage around virtual reality . maybe talk guy virtual reality , effort . maybe help n't help gpu business . yes . excitement virtual reality , next-gen , pc gaming go next complete immersion gaming experience -- , lot key vendor coming holiday season post holiday season beginning 2016 , headset take advantage virtual reality world . key part headset . need infrastructure inï¬‚uence overall experience . many vendor come recommendation type gpu -- necessary take advantage virtual reality experience . looking promote three top gpus take advantage virtual reality . promotes better experience virtual reality experience . 're pleased actual gpus called key infrastructure component . see virtual reality market , guess , playing next year two . obviously 's still nascent right . guy seeing -- bigger percentage revenue look next year maybe 2017 ? believe next wave gaming market . fast grows ; big get -- think 're going still see vendor really come market . acceptance right use form they've pulled together . continue advance . 'll -- 'm sure 'll see generation forward [ ph ] advance u . think 's little bit early say big overall size . definitely attest good portion high-end gaming . okay . thanks . guess , , 'll switch little bit maybe ask million- dollar question -- guess reason folk room today . maybe get thought pc oem business . mean , guy 's obviously used -- little bit soft second quarter -- want get thought see rest year playing . 've heard mixed commentary conference far . interested seeing take pc oem business today . - colette kress - sean vocke - colette kress yes . pc oem business -- refer general-purpose gpu . general-purpose pc and/or notebook . 's generally selling component inside pc notebook . little two year ago , towards end fiscal year 2013 , business probably represented mid 20 % overall company , overall size revenue . material percentage . finishing last quarter , pc oem general-purpose business almost single digit , percentage revenue . 's -- 've continued -- able grow top line 've concentrated market . 's something 're going focus . going something going continue provide gpus -- build design . understand 's going go wave pocket stabilization saw definitely end q2 , not-so-strong growth , actual decline year year . able move platform approach allowed u de-emphasize piece business . okay . thanks . guess want switch gear little bit focus enterprise . another segment guy . obviously 's become bigger bigger percentage overall revenue . think look -- enterprise little bit soft first half . maybe talk little bit , little bit soft first half ? whether quadro ; whether 's tesla . maybe , expectation move -- guess , latter part year ? sure . let 's focus quadro business . quadro business product design enterprise workstation . probably key part macro condition seen first half year , play capital buying cycle , lot capital enterprise . business relatively steady many year . slightly non- growth position right lot challenge fx rate around world , forcing challenge capital purchasing , probably slowed business . finished siggraph , announced couple new graphic card maxwell architecture . [ ph ] design market second half year . 're pretty excited coming . secondly , overall tesla business . , tesla business different business , focused data center focused high-performance computing well - sean vocke - colette kress - sean vocke - colette kressoverall accelerated computing . key highlight -- workload deep learning , example . overall high-performance computing -- overall channel high-performance computing still strong ; still growing market . 're seeing tremendous growth term deep learning , finished fiscal year 2015 year ago 50 % growth overall data center business , largely due key project deep learning , associated internet service provider , leveraging gpus train overall application key workload image detection , voice recognition , video coding . also voice translation . , important workload . project-oriented . 's anything questioning term 's growth . 's really project spend . tremendous excitement still stemming deep learning every day , research new workload forming . true . let 's dig little bit deeper tesla . think $ 300 million -- getting close $ 300 million year . uh-huh . think 've talked ultimately $ 1 billion business . maybe talk , key driver get ? think mentioned deep learning . driver get $ 1 billion mark ? yes . 're talking installed base data center , service , -- several currently accelerated -- accelerating using gpus -- next wave workload data center expansion . need acceleration . overall need data center speed , compute , complete work future , going truly backed overall need acceleration . overall tesla gpu leveraged overall performance ease programmability . program term -- cuda development language , taught many high-end university 500 different place around world . freshly coming university research going business , knowing easy program gpus . - sean vocke - colette kress - sean vocke - colette kress - sean vocke q - unidentified participantso 're seeing need speed key workload data center . think continue advance . fast soon get $ 1 billion ? think 's little hard define . next wave , speed data center . sure . maybe -- ass , guess , competitive landscape term gpu acceleration vi vi fpga solution even , like , xeon phi , example ? gpu sit relative fpga term acceleration . , kind , workload 'd really good , situation [ ph ] space ? yes . 's always case solve problem multiple way . solve acceleration many different form factor . fpgas around many different year , focusing simplistic type programming may necessary data center . get -- maybe lower power . lower performance , particularly fpga , versus 're going see gpu . 're also going see environment lot challenge , reprogramming fpga data center . gpu simplistic term ability change algorithm ï¬‚y ; reset overall workload ; going running . , software environment , friendly type programmer . really n't seen acceleration challenging , high- performing workload data center , need overall fpgas yet . leverage gpus quite consistently . , 's different way solve problem . 're excited coming forward . sure . think one thing get lost among investment community , something guy working many year . whereas feel like fpga guy recently , guess , making push . correct ? think fpgas around quite . think recent consolidation put lot attention , . -- interesting see market change awareness . right . question audience right ? okay . let 's move automotive . think -- sorry , one back . - colette kress - sean vocke - colette kress - sean vockei one virtual reality . kind asp think could get ? guess recommended three different gpus , right ? sort -- ? recommending retail asp gpus . 's starting gpu 970 , 980 980 ti [ ph ] . overall retail price end-to-end card , chip component , retail probably close $ 300 apiece . okay . let 's talk automotive little bit . another area guy excited . 've put lot investment time business . look last year , think $ 180 million . guy talked getting , guess -- going 8 million car 25 million car time . maybe talk time see growing 8 million 25 million car tegra business . yes . last quarter automotive business $ 80 million quarter , term 's running right . grew probably close 80 % last quarter , nearly almost doubling first half fiscal year . 8 million different car road today nvidia technology infotainment center . 25 million new car hit road , really focusing pipeline design win 've already completed . moving forward , 's timing effect term car hit road work manufacturing cycle . 're ready 25 million car . continue work new design win . infotainment system move original high-end car several mainstream line , 'll find u audi , bmws , tesla , volkswagens , golf , hondas . really kind moving toward broad range different car , becomes key main feature selling . work forward , pipeline continue advanced think driver assist selling overall drive platform . announced q2 availability drive platform 50 different oem manufacturer , tier one researcher industry , take , work , move overall software algorithm -- u work together -- 'll come soon next step term drive . sure . think talked ada . company yesterday called mobileye , talking 80 % ada market today . maybe - colette kress - sean vocke - colette kress - sean vocketalk solution different , say -- solution guy , like mobileye . maybe embedded solution ti , say , intel freescale . yes . think another situation everybody 's approaching opportunity different manner . 've approached , looking overall compute platform car -- one complementary many type provider may . 's able incorporate plug-and-play -- different type camera , sensor , type information feeding collective data source . 're taking learning term data center , complex data structured . coming solution overall ada software algorithm . look different competitor , look complete computer platform may necessary -- 'll want function together , looking place car manufacturer want single form software able manage software , going key differentiating piece provider . okay . maybe talk little bit many tegras see per vehicle . see dollar content growing next year two ? yes . right , several car road , 's many four different type processor car , front infotainment system well rear-seat entertainment well . move forward , key component growth producing value software software algorithm , really hoping business model value appreciated , overall asp continue grow . think business model really building software leveraged across many different type manufacturer ; produce increased asp ; may may multiple tegras within . 's auto manufacturer define . either way . okay . question right ? right . let 's talk model . look profitability , margin -- think gross margin 55 % ; operating margin 20 % . maybe talk margin profitability able expand much last couple year . - colette kress - sean vocke - colette kress focus four key market focused platform position , really allowed u separate component underneath type oem . allowed u establish price point establish business model wanted , continue come back produce value , understood overall customer . think growth platform , tesla business , grid business , enterprise business . overall gaming , high-end , also better company average gross margin . really show , platform , opportunity going forward good top line . really pay term gross margin well .
