're really thinking holistic data center migration cloud 're looking mission-critical application , sensitive line business data , core thing , topic become central . 's interesting , oﬃce 365 mature commercial cloud offering early day , people like , obviously , archiving different thing ? started saying , i'm going run entire productivity stack cloud . question matured well . think 're seeing similar cycle infrastructure holistic data center side point . unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia whiteso would say -- going sound crazy , specific technology 's around cloud , 's around -- aws started little decade ago , beyond -- mean , people 's tech company moved today sheer start-up started cloud . , still mainstream corporation , talk , still people limited cloud strategy . point mainstream everyone , kind staff basis . thinking production workload might custom built starting move ? would say , mainstream conversation planning . average even laggard technology organization cloud-first strategy . n't think look mainstream , 's actual cloud adoption infrastructure platform perspective . sense long take move like conversation -- mainstream conversation mainstream deployment ? yes , -- technologist , would want go lot faster live little bubble everything -- quickly technology . done commercial enterprise technology 20 year , always slower technologist want . , mean think 're -- think year year -- actually , end 2016 year 50 % percentage mainstream organization felt cloud security superior getting on-premises 50 % thought inferior . 've hit conversation . think think five year forward , think 'll start seeing good mainstream core line application kind broad adoption , begun real way . trying temper . mean people used tell edi going away . know mainframe still $ 2 million business . let 's practical , term 's going go , curve going shape . 's customer ' wish list , security top priority customer ' wish list else would -- 's -- ? unidentified participant julia whiteyes , security always -- look thing people care -- cloud - - security still number one . 's become le . we’ve seen privacy rising one . think thing talk customer , , mainstream company n't technology living n't knowhow use cloud digital transformation , 's make cloud easier . we're innovating quickly . u , microsoft , thousand new capability coming . , 're -- 're ge , 're manufacturing company 're auto manufacturer , trying keep hard knowing take advantage . thing like , make transition data center cloud much smoother . n't assume everything going go cloud overnight . deep investment hybrid . way hybrid uniquely continuity two , deeply understand data center , well cloud uniquely able make something customer way make sense . think migration certainly top mind . , think already conversation -- even , political domain really focusing call trust . trust principle privacy , security , compliance transparency . 're making sure 're kind cutting edge area . know even business policy political situation change , trust cloud ready full-time business use . 's good segue , given said helping make transition smoother . think competitive environment cloud today . 've differentiated , could go little bit deeper ? yes , think past couple year bit feature war look cloud . feature actually -- 're closing gap feature . think 're point feature aided feature , whatever . 's like feature war . , 's people actually get business outcome cloud . think 's real pivot talking -- mean , massive sale force every day , talking digital transformation . 's conversation customer want u , digital transformation , use text [ ph ] . get new business outcome get . think holistically , 's differentiation question , one , holistic cloud . microsoft cloud , 's azure , oﬃce 365 , dynamic 365 , 's thing . get coherence , lot oﬃce 365 customer want e-mail running collaboration stack . think we've already done identity system use [ ph ] azure , already set . 've already gone security , audit type thing front . unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participanthybrid , definitely major conversation key differentiator microsoft . , understand data center understand cloud . hybrid today -- people use different way . thing , infrastructure data center infrastructure cloud . basically organization 're running two infrastructure , 's consistent , right le expense . 's security come play trying manage two thing 's complex 's reality . 's like everything go cloud overnight . done uniquely , consistent hybrid approach . one directory system , one identity system , whether thing areon-premises cloud . one management security platform , whether thing data center cloud . 're final stage launching consistent platform azure stack , actually speaking technology public cloud azure putting small instantiation customer put data center . it’s ( inaudible ) azure . give data center control . developer build application using cpi , writing application , decide run azure stack data center azure cloud . consistent experience . , going run sql server workload aws , would -- feature would n't available . product would n't available azure stack ? azure stack , correct , mean azure stack well , guess , could use aws azure stack . would little silly honest . right . 're getting benefit sheer developer experience . technology customer access . much -- much innovation like , selling point going talking customer , like said , starting 10- year journey , could say , look work u selling process could 1 % encapsulating on-premise stand . mean , like -- think selling motion type new product might help ease someone's concerned making best move cloud . julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant yes , absolutely , mean acknowledging , , 'll say technology thing . actually major change organization . recently meeting cio across different government agency asked 's single reason cloud adoption faster . said , , organization , that’s human . technology quite mature level . change really , understanding use cloud versus exact thing 've data center cloud , 's really taking advantage cloud . 's still deep fear organization go cloud , mean job ? 're human , job keep coming play . go conversation fully recognizes change initiative say , know , change way need go whatever pace want , hence investment hybrid . leveraging utilizing best massive existing data center infrastructure investment , n't walk away , n't like pull truck ( inaudible ) use . 's advantage . , use cloud intelligently innovate , connect . way , n't mean 're running two different environment that's expensive creates security issue . 's comfortable process people way . think sale force going talking large customer , incented one way another person -- incented differently drive cloud on-premise business holistic approach n't matter kind bucket 's falling ? couple thing though , 've shifted cloud business , adjusted way incentivize sale force . 's part overall company change . , old day , on-premises technology , sale people paid license . license got paid . whether customer use , problem decided . sale people got paid . cloud though , increasingly shifted sale people role dedicated consumption amount paid consumption versus transaction moving . , significant sale force focus getting paid customer actually consumes cloud service , right , giving value . need .

've got whole host question . want see 's audience . 'll get new mic , 're . , think mic’s good . right , 'm going keep going . anyone question , feel free jump . look five year , 10 year said technologist , want happen faster maybe could , percentage workload would get , would cloud , microsoft view , view technologist ? five year ? unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participantfive ten year , fix timeframe . different , hope . yes , kidding . 're feeling kind -- think depending research report look , low-single digit getting double digit today . think five year , 're eclipsing 30 % think double end . think actually linear curve versus steeper , mean think -- part set back camera 's big , right , $ 1.6 trillion think everything logged . little thoughtful term big cam . think 's going -- jumped . think 's going massive amount front . mentioned availability data center space , maybe space -- region 're covering , 's anybody else . think -- given data center also serve oﬃce 365 right serving globe product , think utilization versus competitor ? 's utilization given region cover given breadth product 're offering ? -- taking longer get utilization level would like see inside data center think ? reason anyone else 've done , put data sensor country people data . need handling thing matter . supply chain perspective , 've got incredibly tight get signal point 're actually production center expansion one . one microsoft , 're one largest sale force planet . vast number last-mile signal knowing exactly pipeline look like , kind capacity need build pretty early part pipeline . get pretty good sense . 've done massive amount work 've given decade . consumer service thing , number week signal production pretty high . n't think ( multiple speaker ) . brings another question ( inaudible ) 's people believe microsoft ca n't operate scale aws way cast designed . n't know whether 's myth , whether 's reality , 's certainly something get discussed investment community . wondering could share high-level thought belief ? julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white idea , satya phil , absoluteness , 100 % term - - think skype , oﬃce 365 , consumer service scale global also overall capacity perspective . ad powering vast majority underneath . year -- think -- know nothing technology perspective would suggest scale . think many place believe cost microsoft much scalable ew . oka , question , keep going ? quiet , shy group today , unusual , 's 're great job . used cio sort aws still place take existing window deployment run . seen -- given tremendous growth 've seen azure , seen shift used , hey , 'm going take window run aws , started shift would always start cloud , existing window workload versus maybe three four year ago ? yes , think look run rate , get disproportionate share windows- based technology , n't -- share increasing last year ? strong consistently strong , would say . 've mapped whether 's gotten better , n't know . 's definitely strong continuing . . time , see want clear , think myth around azure n't solve linux workload open source workload . right , sort rbms linux-based . growing . , think people really started hear take heed really believe investment open source . technology truth term well run open source , partnership struck red hat , example , uniquely partnership red hat tier 1 support joint customer , one else , different thing like investment container , kind next generation application model many open source leader world . actually , microsoft , mean , recent report github , number one contributor open source project ahead google , ahead facebook . , azure support around open source . also microsoft overall commitment contribution open source helping set people 's mind around place open source support well . unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia whitehow -- start-up committee typically bought building first aws . last year , even last 12 month . change see company building business azure . think 's area need bigger focus company ? anything share u ? yes , mean microsoft investment , 've done lot around working incubator like -- commentator across globe . coming commentator blast cohort , 're seeing half start-ups using azure . half using aws , increase past understand program get.com , great example step walmart , startup cloud 100 % based azure . , seeing nice start-up win front . think 's always place aws started . aws technology- oriented sort -- technology-oriented thing . make sense early , got first base run . think 're seeing 're making good sense . var community , -- kind whole cloud thing kind changed business model ton , help continue -- mean lot inﬂuence customer , help continue level inﬂuence ? type investment change made term support ? yes . made conversation partner ecosystem . le sometimes customer term mean . eight year ago , started workshop partner , mean become service provider versus service implementer . mean p & l perspective . make money . thing we've always partner company , 90 % commercial revenue go partner . 's changing term went partner front model cloud able call cloud service provider program . essentially , reseller license . , maybe 's implementation afterwards , equivalent thing cloud . ask , add value-added service top versus transactor . cloud service world . , expectation ecosystem different . 're giving understandable , clear way make ongoing revenue cloud service . , build new business top . unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia whitethat 's place continue invest making sure ecosystem grows microsoft . 's kind dna 've always believed financially , maybe going back differentiation question , think important one . made past , even like six month , number conversation partner like aws partner , think 're going pat back . 'm going . , dna . 's still core microsoft believe . satya talk lot ai . company build sustainable , competitive advantage ? simple thing , moonshot time really paid . laid new technology fabric called fpga , field-programmable gate array . basically way get processing speed -- silicon actually . many year ago , started project 've fully lined entire cloud new technology , let 's assume incredible new ultrafast processing capability . 's unique differentiator take anyone near , even started journey talked , way 've done incredibly unique differentiated . term thinking massive turnkey power wire , video analysis , type thing unique infrastructure . already put market . 's , 's also intelligence graph , microsoft graph looking different activity correlation going thing , oﬃce 365. intelligence security graph looking different security signal different cloud let u view different thing perspective . pretty unique position term insight put utilize artificial intelligence way , different graph well fundamental cloud infrastructure put place , put u strong position , frankly . okay . last question , sitting 12 month , goal would expect cloud business achieved ? year , well way hitting 20 billion cloud metric laid . top sure . ai area , would clear leader artificial intelligence , capability customer actually realizing production ai versus dreaming . unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white unidentified participant julia white operatoryou think , 'll see production ai workload next year ? think . okay . yes , real practical way , think 'll see really good closure gap ia space azure aws term closing . mean closing ? term overall market share . okay , right , , thank julia . thank much . thanks everybody coming . thank . question answer question .
