okay . great . colette ? colette , hear ? okay . ? hi , colette . ? 'm good . 'm good . well , welcome , welcome london . jefferies room . nearly standing-room-only audience , also would like welcome . would like welcome , everybody , came stayed nvidia fireside chat everybody dialing online . , thanks lot , colette , making time u . know travel conﬂicts prevented coming , 're grateful join u 8:30 morning , west coast time . thank . thank , mark , arranging . good solution -- conﬂicts , 's diﬃcult spend much time traveling . 's lot , 'm really pleased found solution . q - mark lipacis - colette kressquestions answer well , found -- understood busy processing order customer completely understand . colette , 'll go -- 'll introduce 'll start q & . colette -- many already know , evp chief financial oﬃcer nvidia . joined company september 2013 , coming 10 year anniversary right around corner . previously served three year senior vice president cfo cisco 's business technology operation , finance organization . previously , spent 13 year microsoft , including four year cfo server tool division . prior , served texas instrument variety financial position . looking resume , good track record picking big dominant player respective industry . 'll eagerly watching make another move . colette , would like start asking big picture question . outlook intel amd accurate second quarter first quarter history data center nvidia 's data center revenue greater intel amd combined . would argue proof tectonic shift computing . reﬂections ? investor read ? key element nvidia 's strategy brought position ? great question , mark , start . 'm going real quick . reminder , presentation contains forward-looking statement , investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business . look 're seeing today data center business , something arose term short amount period time . working accelerated computing platform , different solution , system , product . 'm working ecosystem 15 year . work seeing really starting blossom . another way look , 's important -- inﬂection point . 's inﬂection point think two different key piece . first thinking importance accelerated computing many folk around globe really understood importance moving accelerated computing better performance , next generation computing focus term sustainability going truly essential data center see . q - mark lipaciswe working many year . accelerated computing calling accelerator , 's really looking full data center whole decoupling different part focus speed together . keep mind , end moore 's law really triggered fuel towards accelerated computing , 's 're seeing today people understanding $ 1 trillion worth installed-base cpu-only type server question term , something folk want refuel readd infrastructure going time moving accelerated computing . performance improvement could get right cpu-only server high . 's cost-intensive move continuous improvement performance . see accelerated computing driver today . 's driver see . driver see inﬂection point 're seeing ai importantly , last six month , 've seen term generative ai . 've talked quite time different type workload important right different type solution ai , focusing recommendator system , recommendator engine also large language model . generative ai really take large language model provides offering term generative ai front center . another way saying chatgpt holiday , really opened eye ceo around world essentially consumer anybody enterprise looking solution know could use assisting company monetization improving eﬃciency using moving generative ai . lot different solution . lot different model likely built visualizing saw chatgpt . guidance q2 really building upon year year working industry accelerated computing solution ai . , continue see demand demand visibility full year well believe sustain finish q2 . great . think demand-side , talked generative ai think one thing also guy mentioned past power ecosystem . 've heard jensen observed pc era computing era horizontal computing era different company made chip software box , every era ecosystem vertically-integrated single company , ibm mainframe , digital , equipment corporation minicomputer , nokia feature phone , apple smartphones . maybe could share u view , like , key part ecosystem -- software ecosystem 're offering chip company may offered pc era ? - colette kress q - mark lipacis correct , mark . 're chip company . whole position data center perspective thinking full ecosystem full end-to-end stack , term time gpu accelerating work , time information data enters data center . another way looking ecosystem focused data center computing whole end-to-end . mean ? incorporate ? surely , work term gpu base work done 20 year , 30 year , also focusing development platform . , way back 15 year ago , decision make put cuda available every single gpu sold key . key development platform folk could take gpu determine great new use-case , researcher , folk leaving higher education , learning cuda using continuing build . many , many different generation cuda , underlying pinning able scale one decision 15 year ago . lot thing done ecosystem . take approach agnostic different part within data center . data center filled cpu storage , security device , new focus term dpu , data processing unit , much term memory well . focus thinking data enters speed transacting throughout accelerated computing workload whole building upon interconnect , nvlink connection , cpu gpu , gpu gpu continues find eﬃcient way focus , growing market ai . we're still early day ai , although maybe inﬂection point , lot work term scale-up scale-out term data center . importantly , outside cuda stack additional software sdks full library , helping industry industry , help move accelerated computing help move ai better understand application use within industry realigning gpu use versus standard cpu . lot work engineer working end-to-end customer . , course , large hardware engineering team solely focused term gpu , also networking acquisition mellanox . important piece . let 's forget engineer almost equal size term software engineer focused term building much work 've done time . compare ecosystem guy built like may seen pc era like apple , think 's debate whether open ecosystem get levered , get leverage embracing developer versus kind closed one . think think macintosh back day maybe closed ecosystem limited -- - colette kress q - mark lipacis - colette kressability scale . would characterize software ecosystem guy architected ? software ecosystem work industry player providing u tremendous insight term needed rewire lot work move accelerated computing . say , leave open anybody start working honestly , 's want spend time . 've got fast-growing market , accelerated computing ai , see folk really wanting work solution . well , nvidia working stitching together making sure matter working matter change make term type gpu moving architecture , architecture , backwards compatible forward compatible . probably long imagine , 10 year working back 10 year working forward . important step taken ? count continued software update nvidia keeping current . allows model opened used matter architecture 're . keep u focused term software consistency software across different platform . 's balance . 's balance say , yes , absolutely need input industry helping u term need software . 're right , hook complete software make available easily available part ecosystem . great . want shift near-term question get . guy gave guidance july quarter , beat everybody 's expectation 50 % sequential growth . think concern investor kind one-time spike come back . know guy guide one quarter time . say investor concern 's one-time spike ? talk general term , visibility typically like data center hyperscale company ? yeah . seen certainly astounding amount interest worldwide globally many different type customer set . mean csps . mean consumer internet company . mean enterprise , high- performance computing customer supercomputing . era important part term 're seeing term interest . visibility improved . visibility company helping u understand ready accept compute , want compute stand within data center help even networking compute together . visibility improved . better visibility 've seen . q - mark lipacis - colette kress q - mark lipacis - colette kress q - mark lipacisand ability focus right procuring supply . indicated earnings , procured supply demand 's put front u visibility see . believe 're different stage 've last several year term growth ai ? surely , . believe generative ai something fuel several year sure . got . would say another -- know fielded question probably 1,000 time since reported . 's kind view growth driven asp maybe much unit . investor think asp growth versus unit growth quarter past quarter outlook ? , truly seeing demand need across wide group folk . 's based sure selling brand new architecture ramping new architecture , hopper architecture . still shipping existing prior architecture ( inaudible ) . , asp . really growth 're seeing focusing ai accelerated computing . believe sheer volume company really interested taking next step really leveraging generative ai work . that's really 's . give u sense -- know 're -- 're reramping new product , hopper product . previous generation ampere . give u sense like transition period ? think -- sell ampere product long period time ? long transition ? insight , think people would appreciate . yes . hopper architecture started hitting market approximately q3 last year q3 fiscal year last year , started ramping q4 . many cloud service provider interested making available cloud , setting qualification future h100 type purchase . 's began . 's , common u , architecture architecture keep selling existing architecture . ? already pre-qualed . folk extending existing cluster , becomes also great architecture probably second best world continue working ampere . likely dual type architecture continue . 'll think start slow , unsure time . yes , still sell architecture . - colette kresscan talk inventory strategy ? think normally , semiconductor see company build inventory , get little concerned perhaps mismanaged strategic planning process , right ? built inventory lot front previous quarter . looked like high inventory actually good signal . trying inventory ? want -- came little bit ? came bit ? want take ? want take ? maybe talk customer -- kind observation inventory ? let 's look perspective one piece supply chain looking inventory , inventory hand . always going staged approach . remember , 's large mix term inventory actually several business , automotive business , graphic business gaming professional virtualization data center . different area different lead time , lead time term procuring , accepting inventory . , lot still done complete system . may staged approach actually finish full system ship system . outside looking inventory also thinking purchase commitment . read term purchase claim also disclosed , 's also ordering necessarily received . remember , contract manufacturer lot 're . procuring contract manufacturing , course , even wafer and/or memory different type piece . overall strategy diligent possible term looking forward-looking demand able back kind lead time , meet overall customer ' expectation term want receive . right , given data center significant part business longer lead time , see different [ ph ] term day inventory and/or purchase commitment due complexity build well lead time . example , think hopper architecture architecture something 30,000 different component create one system . much love wafer , chip part , 's one part journey complete great system . position right surely watching inventory purchase commitment together . 's getting ready understanding demand front u . 's really strategy lie . q - mark lipacis - colette kress great . want -- 'll come back kind ecosystem kind strategy . software part . previously disclosed software growing part revenue base , although quite small . see software growing ? think grows faster ? ever think -- way recognize kind non-hardware revenue software ecosystem approach 've taken ? correct . 've taken approach selling software separately . know , many system right incorporate significant amount software really sold separately , included full price system create . 's another opportunity u create software help many enterprise many different industry move towards ai . let 's kind talk kind three largest piece . first one nvidia aie . nvidia aie essentially full package essential operating system overall ai . important enterprise want get started really leverage keeping everything straight within data center , keeping close watch compute 've got full stack begin building need term new model and/or tracking term progress eﬃcient data center running . available . enterprise want u . want make sure helping providing software keep risk minimized count u completing software . 's one piece . second piece omniverse . omniverse platform solution software . allowing future metaverses many different way , ability create digital twin , ability create 3d environment internet . important piece work individual team within enterprise look omniverse 's solution . lastly important one automotive software . automotive software sits addition hardware would inside car , fueling ada fueling level 2 , level 3 beyond type software . 's many partner , particularly daimler agreement well jlr agreement . important ramping sharing software revenue u partner . 're excited piece believe automotive pipeline going forward $ 14 billion , good portion focused software revenue two partner likely going forward . right , software revenue , 've indicated hundred million dollar believe 's important piece infrastructure purchase software likely hand-in-hand many thing see going forward . q - mark lipacis - colette kress q - mark lipacis - colette kress q - mark lipacis great . 're running time , may ask one last question . talked -- talk manufacturing strategy . jensen made argument past guy like diversified strategy . use tsmc , use samsung important supplier . computex , believe said he's interested exploring sourcing chip intel . could play back like announcement ? like message ? investor think ? absolutely . intel foundry perspective interesting . 's interesting many company , certainly , 's interesting u . love redundancy allows u multiple fab provider . 're probably one one strong two fab provider currently tsmc samsung . adding third , looking u also bound [ ph ] type fabs would great u well . work continues . lot really partnership . 's partnership tsmc , partnership samsung . think machinery , really people , service , getting know u going operate . know done . 've done 30 year continued partnership , 'd love see could add something like intel well . great . well , run time . colette , thank much joining u today . really appreciate getting early spending time u . comment well received . hopefully , maybe see back next year in-person . absolutely . absolutely . would great . okay . thanks much arranging . appreciate . take care . thank , colette . thanks everybody joining , thanks everybody online dialed .
