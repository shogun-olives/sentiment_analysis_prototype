hey , . good morning , . thanks everyone joining u day two well fargo 's tmt summit . 'm michael turrin , software analyst well . i'm excited next session . privilege rolling coverage microsoft recently joining u today largest software company planet . think 's neck neck largest company , n't chance check lately , charles lamanna , cvp business apps platform microsoft . 'll start question . list front . anyone something , 'd like type , shoot email michael.turrin @ wellsfargo.com . 'll best add conversation well . charles , thank joining u today . certainly appreciate time . yeah . thanks , michael . 'm super excited discussion . think , lot good topic microsoft share . agree . mean , maybe framing conversation start , obviously admire many end market , company presence . within day , maybe could help add context around role , responsibility , key product area focus , help steer conversation . dive . absolutely . sound good . head call business application platform team , basically map dynamic 365 power platform set product . lead product management , well engineering component . michael turrin charles lamannaso basically design implementation servicing different cloud offering . 've -- area 4 year . worked azure 4 year . joined azure 2013 , company founded acquired microsoft . 'd say , slowly moved stack infrastructure paas saas , ( inaudible ) platform . directly sell software company head eventually . mean , 's great start azure , question . time started azure pretty darn good . say , congrats . let 's start evolution business application microsoft . mean , dynamic around time , dynamic became 365 recent period time . growth trajectory dynamic 365 really stood , particularly late . talk around evolution 're dynamic ? maybe what's driving recent strength ? absolutely . certainly , mentioned dynamic around long time microsoft . went bit , 'd say , rapid evolution sorry , 5 year ago . 's really started idea dynamic 365 future business application microsoft . first biggest piece really moving business cloud . cloud first really make business delivered saas product , easy sign , easy trial easier go-to-market compared say legacy premise heavy crm erp offering . first important piece . 're done quite time . second big thing , started reimagine business application mean , kind future . go build apps 2005 2010. biz apps 2020 , 2025 , 2030. thought really required u focus three main theme , fundamentally change adopt use business application . first thing data first . 's idea every single company massive amount data coming everything , whether 's e- commerce website , mobile application , iot , name . 's massive amount data , different biz apps past , data entered human filling form . 's idea large amount data leveraging business application . second thing data , course want go make prediction use intelligence ai natural language understanding , nlu , get value data . idea automation help thing like reducing cost delivering customer support 20 % 25 % improving targeting upsell cross-sell e-commerce website 5 % , really top line bottom line moving outcome ai , different pure ai platform . tied business process . third piece around collaboration . 's idea past , say , biz app data biz app user kind lived little island throughout company . big push want go reimagine world data shared across company people work together . like want silo data silo line business . start reimagine whether silo people either , people come together work right data right place right time . move cloud . focus data , ai collaboration . course , third piece critical built product portfolio easy adopt required u break monolithic crm erp offering . -- gone day people remember dynamic , crm dynamic ( inaudible ) dynamic ax , two big apps everything one diï¬ƒcult implement premise . cloud , reimagine actually bunch individually adoptable application , really span across five main area customer . area number one around customer support . help customer deliver world-class customer support thing like dynamic 365 customer service , power virtual agent , ai builder , well new omni- channel digital voice capability . item number two around supply chain . core supply chain execution , supply chain insight , supply chain sustainability capability , individually adaptable module , n't go replace existing erp system . item number three around revenue generation . sale marketing commerce offering . help customer generate revenue , whether 's digital sale direct selling , dedicated sale force . next one around service centric operation , helping customer move new way work providing service opposed product . last pillar number five power platform , really enabling full company digital transformation . really five main area , decompose crm erp fit . provided bunch little adoptable component , replace core apps provide value top core apps . last bit 've able really accelerate growth , gone day go customer convince rip replace stuff . instead , provide value right place . data really bear effective , like shared recently , dynamic 365 revenue grew 48 % year-over-year , 45 % constant currency , 70 % revenue cloud . new area like power apps , growing right around 200 % year-over-year growth . lot new exciting rapidly growing product , kind embracing idea cloud embracing idea data , ai collaboration . maybe little bit longer answer wanted , think 's good left right view 're microsoft . michael turrin charles lamanna , set stage planning . 've heard intelligent application power platform mantra quite bit . 's good get -- know context behind well . want go key pillar laid start data particular . 're hearing lot around data right changing standard , focused first party data , voice customer . microsoft customer insight , position around cdp . talk around customer data 're application side ? absolutely . think , like area , really interesting right many customer , thing like idfa change apple , well move like cookie le future browser , basically requiring everybody rethink replan track know customer engage digital service area . good news , basically every company degree digital transformation . actually lot digital touchpoints directly customer . 's value , 's data come . e-commerce website mobile app iot keurig machine something like , 's information use start understand customer using product , well next best product offer next best service offer . well start direct marketing various different channel like email , message , text messaging inside product . anyway , say 's kind landscape . 's great , dynamic 365 customer insight , customer data platform cdp , customer leverage understand customer drawing different data source inside basically landscape customer facing landscape . way customer insight work connect 50 different system box , rapidly easily ingest data , whether 's marketing system say , web analytics back end erp . pull data together real-time create dedicated profile individual customer . profile used change behavior , term engage customer also used across different marketing campaign . 's great , 's data customer . 's data owned aggregator gatekeeper form kept locked behind advertising infrastructure . 's actually data customer owning manage . give degree independence , going important go fundamental change track provided browser mobile device . michael turrin charles lamanna michael turrin charles lamannado n't , 're going effective . see impact already . know , last couple quarter , 's lot news impact idfa change , particular , come b2c company , well company provide advertising . 's great . area mentioned automation . want touch . maybe start , level set power platform encompasses . hear lot . seems like number permutation take . maybe set stage power platform currently fit functionality platform encompasses today ? yeah , absolutely . like always start talking power platform , kind like explaining 's important customer . , -- 's lot great stats idc gartner . 're talking thing like next 5 year , 500 million new apps need built . 's apps built last 40 year . longer 've alive . 's huge volume apps need built . additionally , something like 50 % oï¬ƒce work could automated today , current technology tool , somebody . 85 % organization ca n't understand unstructured data . , basically , mean 's huge unmet need go build solution help customer usually transform . course , way would normally solve going hiring army developer . 's also study saying 's 4 million professional developer shortfall next year , 's going make impossible . pretty expensive . look mean term supply demand cost ( inaudible ) 's lot challenge going happen . 'd say last 20 year , -- 'd say little bit naive view solve challenge . huge demand insuï¬ƒcient supply going teaching everybody write code . go teach random people write code , go teach people work finance write code , 've tried . successful scale . mean , n't . mean , get worse . like literally , used stat 's million developer shortfall . got update , 's 4 million developer shortfall . grows every year . think though way go solve . 's call low code development . low code development idea visual interactive way , much like use excel powerpoint , go develop solution actually get job done , go knock huge chunk 500 million new apps 50 % automation . offering low-code no-code space something called power platform . power platform four main product . power bi low-code data exploration , visualization reporting . power apps low code web mobile application development . power automate low code workï¬‚ow automation robotic process automation . power virtual agent low code conversational agent chatbots . four product kind serve different need , whether 's analyzing data acting automating . core idea . super easy get started used everybody company . business user leverage . professional leverage . professional developer leverage either start developing first time start actually go code develop solution faster ever . look space , nearly 20 million monthly active user power platform today . 's something really started go big last 3 year . power platform n't even exist 5 year ago . think opportunity massive . think basically , everybody earth could ultimately power platform user , like everybody earth could excel user outlook user . 's kind big think really go . what's exciting u , go look across power platform area , 've space . really strong credibility . power bi far away leader , basically every access gartner magic quadrant , come self service bi . power apps , gartner come said , 's number one low code app development platform . announced 's 10 million monthly active user power apps alone . big market leading offering , think going continue grow aggressive pace . like mentioned earlier , power apps growing right around 200 % year-over-year revenue generation perspective well . kind complement extends , insight dynamic 365. go buy one apps . want something , n't go box easily build power platform . winning combo . 's actually dynamic power platform together inside microsoft , think go closely well , leverage 's business process transformation , business value , business outcome . case , app great shelf . sometimes app , got build , drop power platform . ton michael turrin charles lamanna michael turrin charles lamannaenergy . 's something 'd say definitely worth tracking next couple year , kind vision continues accelerate u . make lot sense . one area think investor become conscious rpa . power automate great story around automating repetitive task well . 'm wondering , help characterize power automate fit discussion ? right way think microsoft-centric use case ? broader ? 'm wondering , could help level set vision around 're automate ? yeah , 'd say , view power automate today broad based automation platform . today , 're market leader feature capability adoption perspective . course , 're going great integration microsoft product , like 's true . 's 's really exciting microsoft , build amazingly . easy , yeah . yeah . right , 's lot easier . people hall across street go build integration . absolutely , connectivity kind system key . fact , power automate 550 data connector available box sale force , service , workday , sap , name . probably connect typical enterprise capability . also recently integration company even go accelerate case power automate deeper enterprise data connectivity . also power automate desktop , support ui based automation . classical rpa , right window . 's included window 11 support application window . 's lot way accessibility handle computer vision ai , support type app . sap think used -- sap ui probably used power automate desktop ui automation stuck today . definitely , 's broad based rpa product . place think really something unique microsoft . reason think uniqueness important rpa going little bit change . like internally , call move like rpa cloud rpa rpa rpa 2.0 gartner call hyper automation , idea automation ui macro , kind gross simplification really want go deliver business value . michael turrin charles lamannaand instead talk cloud rpa , 's api connectivity . 's deep integrated ai capability . 's ability also ui automation , also even go run manage vms cloud unintended bot . people deep rpa . 's key component . recently announced azure virtual desktop integration . basically run everything elastically scale , infrastructure nothing deployed locally , power automate . 're one market today . connector via api anyone market today . cloud rpas api space super key . 's really 's unlocked . growth number 've seen . hundred thousand organization . organization , people , lot people . hundred thousand organization using power automate today , billion automation action every month today . reason cloud rpa delivery mechanism easy get started . 's could put power automate desktop inside window 11. 's people anywhere world walk powerautomate.com build bot le 60 second , infrastructure required . really compelling , fast time value 's low edge case , 's high end . great case study company like coca-cola , used power automate simplify 11 step process , cost 10 million dollar really replace email spreadsheet phone call type thing . actually 4,000 solution already deployed coca-cola . really go broad , 's low code 's accessible . scale way complex . absolutely think 're going major player . look , recent gartner mq , show strong leader rpa well . case study saw like jpmorgan , put one 're -- think taught consideration rpa vendor well today . lot great data power automate used broadly , well narrowly lot customer . another great stats . couple question come audience . want throw . first one actually one -- think intending ask , . mean , mentioned , think service support early term number thing laid u start . talked virtual agent 've seen . mean , 've seen proliferation team gotten . question , goal around contact center ? area could see microsoft investing heavily future ? think contact center , especially next something like team ? yeah . absolutely . 'd say , absolutely , 's area look . 'd say , like contact center way implement customer support , well implement thing even like revenue generation , like lot company contact center sale purpose . , 'd say , contact center super exciting u reason . number one , lot great asset space already . dynamic 365 customer service app module . lot market share , 's growing quickly . 's something support agent contact center use every day work case . similarly , also power virtual agent automating conversational agent across web chat , well social channel recently voice . also lot contact center ai capability , also go help basically customer automate task coaching assisting support agent , whereby automating driving self service customer . 's exciting , 's 40 plus billion dollar year tam , go look across customer cec , ccars ccai , three big category $ 40 billion tam . two major disruption happening right . first , 's cloud laggard . anymore , mean , everybody get stock cloud . last saw 's majority , like analyst , majority folk still deploy core contact center infrastructure premise . 's going go cloud , like everything . 's team super valuable , built amazing call routing , call distribution point presence around globe inside team infrastructure . 're able build top , go think moving cloud . cloud major disruptive item . second one ai . like ai buzzword , hear time . inside contact center , 's probably one best place map ai back business value . say automate 20 % customer support request , $ 0.5 billion return investment 5 year large b2c company . rare find place , 's clear yield . one point deï¬‚ection self service ai . like -- example would call airline change ï¬‚ight . instead talk agent , actually talking bot saying , hey , want change ï¬‚ight , 's ï¬‚ight number want change . , one point $ 10 million large customer . every time make ai better , 's another point point point . would say really exciting focus u , n't usually get opportunity come business application . usually 's little amorphous right . move u customer support agent experience better . well , measure ? 's return ? 's simple . use contact center ai capability reduce cost , prove case volume go agent drop . , exciting challenge u . microsoft , strong ai asset across already built inside oï¬ƒce , inside team , inside azure , introducing dynamic really deliver promise meaningful michael turrin charles lamanna michael turrin charles lamannaway customer . super bullish . power virtual agent one important example ai automation capability customer . , 's power virtual agent bot , going go service customer opposed human . 's kind think future going much space . great . 's amazing many thing overview . 's another question came . 's classification characterization within dynamic 365 growth . question , way think much could coming replacement on-prem dynamic ? maybe help u understand journey transition , like said two product set 365 ? mostly complete , add characterization growth ? yeah . think data -- stat shared really highlight . ( technical diï¬ƒculty ) first thing , 'd say growth predominantly coming net new workload deployed customer , migrating premise workload . see really two stats shared . number one , 70 % dynamic 365 revenue come cloud . overall dynamic come cloud . 's super important stat . base small on-prem really meaningful actually go drive growth number . second , shy 50 % year-over-year growth . also ca n't really converting existing customer installed base . i'd say -- really , 's migration phase largely . 'd say , 's much keep growth growth 've done last 12 month really requires u landing cloud workload new customer across five pillar , talked earlier . really five area focus . 's lot cloud workload like power platform , cloud . go look lot supply chain asset , cloud . 'd say definitely 's cloud , cloud , cloud day 's big focus sure . -- 'm curious prioritize internally given many direction application business evolve towards ? 've talked significant technology trend . 's probably long list thing underneath , could explore . -- decision process informs make top versus might fall ? customer feedback ? data 're able analyze ? maybe give u sense , like 's amazing can't imagine look like perspective ? michael turrin charles lamanna michael turrin charles lamannayeah , would say like , first foremost , live breathe customer quantitatively qualitatively . fairly large 'd say , like surprisingly large installed base , talked really 's hundred thousand across power platform dynamic 365 organization . interesting quantitative analysis based population understand feature used , deep customer happen type thing . also engineering team side , work close customer . thing like customer advisory board , partner advisory council . thing like power champion digital community . lot way 's one one . customer always center always informed go build . 's another piece , choose kind strategically want go . 's field look like . five pillar 'd say chose five pillar around customer support , supply chain , service centric operation , revenue generation power platform . area already asset microsoft , think lot disruption happening market . able talk contact center , customer support bit . type viewpoint across five pillar , certain disruption happening . item number three something think accrues broader microsoft cloud story . end day like biz app , love biz apps . important thing microsoft cloud , commercial cloud position . kind see lot announcement lot position . also always carefully factoring contribute back overall microsoft cloud story . , three main lever used choose five investment area . within area , focus customer feedback . mean , make sound algorithmic . 's clearly . yeah . 'm -- 'm framework guy , love algorithmic sound . may document internally used talk ( inaudible ) would love , know . 's fantastic . well , look , could spend day kind chatting thing 're working . time valuable 've actually run allocated today . charles , fantastic . really appreciate joining . would n't normally say , best luck fighting irish , given transition . appreciate time , sure . michael turrinabsolutely . thanks , michael thanks everybody tuning . look forward additional q & future oï¬ „ ine . , thanks . excellent . thanks , everyone joining . much appreciate .
