's lot back-and-forth happen . philip alan winslow amy e. hood philip alan winslow amy e. hood q - philip alan winslow - amy e. hoodso first speaker today , fireside chatted philip winslow , research analyst -- verb , fireside chatted -- amy hood , counterpart , cfo microsoft . please welcome amy hood stage . okay . thanks , john . ( inaudible ) right . 'm glad 've got heater . 's ... . maybe -- yes , turn . well yes , planned conference , goal 2 force nature come . winter amy hood . 'm glad made . amy , thank taking time . 's really -- really mean lot u agreed keynote inaugural conference . came -- standing freezing . 's like -- think almost turned heat . yes . question answer -- get thing started , 's shocker . might want talk azure commercial cloud oﬃce 365 , start . obviously guy adjusted goal $ 20 billion arr commercial cloud . said , two year ago actually hit target early , faster 'd anticipated -- guess question , -- kind start thing , like see growth trending coming year ? obviously 's going faster expected . yes . think couple thing set target april may two year ago , -- think certainly understanding tam expansion opportunity . knew good amount confidence oﬃce 365's transition would look like . saw talk people . close thought installed base would move , thought % within installed base would transition cloud two year . would say portion unknown . think many way , u , bigger question quickly transition customer side would happen . felt pretty confident could execute azure ; competitive ; interesting story differentiated one , including fact committed hybrid q - philip alan winslow - amy e. hoodfrom beginning architecture . u , think pacing market . think thing gone pretty quickly customer side term -- even heard john talk important well fargo . there's hundred hundred story . think pacing probably bigger surprise . feel good execution , obviously . 's -- 's much market opportunity execution line . got . well let 's break sort 2 bucket commercial cloud . 'll start first oﬃce . 've talked call , guess , almost two year ago . think oﬃce 365 subscription growth outpacing sort offsetting decline license side . let 's think -- question get lot . 's , `` , like , azure ? '' oﬃce license , oﬃce 365. azure , 's replacement . 's also lot net expansion . think term sort like forward growth process ? yes , 've always explained fundamentally different transition . oﬃce 365 , even designed pricing model 7 eight year ago , different job oﬃce cfo , go -- 's long world view term oﬃce . oﬃce really opportunity 's seat business . sell something seat , opportunity say 're going transition license subscription pretty clear . certain number information worker world . know one meet today license , know one n't . 's new seat . knew one transition . 's transitioning seat . could easily say going 2 driver . going installed base growth new seat n't able reach paid model . going transition customer -- ultimately would lead arpu expansion possibility . one , think transition quite clear . take one seat . move . happened paid upfront , got pay 3 four year . math pretty clean term able predict look like . distinction azure actually think 're seeing -- u others , 're seeing on-prem growth cloud growth people decide want run infrastructure , including investment 've made past . u look like , particularly sql even window , continued license growth even `` transition '' 's transition . really people continuing add investment technology bucket spend digitize whatever process , whether 's business process marketing environment sale . kind go list . , 's think bring people back singular kpi really indifferent , long meet customer need infrastructure platform buy on-prem license buy azure stuff . one thing cared differently year , think , past we're really focused azure consumption opposed billing cycle , important distinction . always recognize revenue based consumption . n't get recognize revenue selling something . really focusing q - philip alan winslow - amy e. hood q - philip alan winslowthat motion customer make sure 're successful really important pivot 've taken . yes . actually , maybe double click second : obviously , made change sale force incentivize focus consumption . talked earnings call sort -- 's deeper customer relationship . know customer . think process -- almost like bit culture change pushing product . speak . sale team would ever . pushing product actually focusing consumption . put sale force , model ? well think , let break . 's couple thing 've done sale force year . started really july largest sale force change 've certainly long 've company , week 15 year , shocking . time ﬂies 're fun , guess . really fundamentally change go market customer type . high end , 's meant adding lot resource technical . say technical , mean would probably see distinction someone work redmond writing line code 's typical . fully capable implementing project start-up cost -- cost meaning effort . 're capable getting project ground . 're capable demoing deep azure functionality . type person someone , frankly , microsoft used way . tended use type person , type talent either service business , consulting arm obviously one engineering team . large investment meant fundamentally consumption . 's people paid . they're paid selling contract azure . 're booking . 're paid customer successful , meaning get project running . meter start spinning azure . 's get rewarded . think life cycle making customer successful , absolutely start . 'd invest technical expertise help journey . 'd pick right project matter . 'd show roi hands-on effort get project speed . 'd see person rewarded successful outcome . 's 'm pretty wedded concept different way rewarding people 's cleanly aligned structurally customer success , ultimately consumption-based business customer success matter build time . got . ( inaudible ) . well let 's focus back oﬃce second . 'm going make statement . 'm going read statement . want tell sort 'm right 'm wrong . oﬃce 365 might halfway past point , term adoption , 50 % installed base . microsoft still early stage migration premium skus , i.e . e1 e2 , -- sorry , e3 , e5 maybe even e7 one day . 's going last next 5 , 10 year . right . wrong statement ? - amy e. hood q - philip alan winslow - amy e. hood 're right structurally 're . would say model seat business particular , like one , move customer . active directory deployed recent service general , churn go , ultimately raise effective pricing . sku transition people -- continue build high-value product customer see benefit product , move tend move sku tiering , . 'll ton customer n't need functionality . ( inaudible ) ton finding right place . logic correct , build . reason tends longer tail simply accounting tend sign 3-year agreement . time actually get everybody 3-year cycle new sku , finally asp lift fully implemented across spectrum . tends come . come slowly tends pretty consistent trajectory . got . let 's stick oﬃce ecosystem talk linkedin , acquisition , obviously big deal microsoft . thinking folding linkedin go-to-market strategy year sort going forward ? think 've -- number one , let start 'm incredibly pleased gone . 's -- year next week week since closed transaction . 're ahead every financial target set . feel good . employee pleased , meaning 're happier used . 's actually terrific thing term retention employee . 're thrilled . 've seen bit revenue reacceleration , talked last quarter result . see thing , feel good strong start incredibly important decision made important financial investment 've made . way 'll start see 've already seen -- little thing . frankly , think 's 'll get used little bit one , start see integration experience : whether 's going word seeing linkedin integration resume building ; whether 's sale navigator integration crm solution social selling ; whether 's maybe incremental hr effort linkedin sell existing customer base . think 'll see really functioning , thoughtful sale team i'm really fine bumping little bit , work actually fine way . instead trying jam 2 sale force together let -- disrupt basically customer momentum , 've made active choice . 's -- ton example buy company integrate sale force . one , certainly , given momentum -- think really unique attribute . 'll see show across oﬃce , across dynamic . within linkedin tangible side . wo n't probably see large big-bang moment . 's really linkedin culture . , much anymore . 'll see thoughtful integration customer care show product every month . q - philip alan winslow - amy e. hood q - philip alan winslow - amy e. hood ( inaudible ) . okay , spent fair amount time revenue side commercial cloud oﬃce . mean one thing jumped last quarter outside hitting $ 20 billion arr jump commercial cloud gross margin . 500 bps quarter-to-quarter , 800 bps year-over-year . one question got much related , let 's say , mix oﬃce 365 azure ; mix shift , call , standard service premium -- premium service within . ... actually pretty clean , 's mostly azure . oﬃce continued gross margin improvement , fact service last quarter , whether 's dynamic , underlyings , mix shift , think azure 's highest grower , -- 's mix shift azure . yet 're still seeing gross margin get better . one math 's pretty clean . 's azure gross margin improvement . part premium service mix . part also cost per -- cost infrastructure improvement across hardware software work . feel good team 's effort . proud last quarter , think , many reason . think felt like , every earnings call , would get asked pejoratively margin structure . said kind 6 quarter ago expected material gross margin last year q1 , think feel like , `` hi . going stop asking ? '' said , `` well keep going . 'll let know . '' yes , great . guess , okay . scale important part , obviously , azure . think scrolling forward , obviously 've got premium skus 365. 've got new premium service azure . scale azure . think gross margin commercial cloud going forward ? put take really getting continued improvement ? one spend lot time component , talk commercial cloud gross margin , cleanest way revenue , think one big cloud business look like scale , actual management technique quite different . team work quite differently . want focus oﬃce 365 margin get . dynamic margin get service . linkedin ultimately -- linkedin , clean amwork 's 82 , 83 , 84 , mean , 's pretty structurally high-gross- margin business . go look azure 's premium service iaas-type layer . manage toward best-in-class goal . outcome matter mix revenue ultimately exists . continue believe room grow , 's really makeup revenue look like . 'll see going forward azure continue grow piece , put structural downward pressure . 'll see probably continue increase , want see pricing competitiveness standpoint . q - philip alan winslow - amy e. hood q - philip alan winslow right . well 've spent lot time talking oﬃce azure . want switch gear little business called window . think microsoft might known . one thing 's really struck past several quarter , look growth window revenue versus pc market , mean , microsoft excluded out-punching pc market . get similar thing . get question client , saying , `` okay , attached ? piracy ? asp mix shift towards premium skus ? sustainable ? '' maybe walk u 's going 's driven outperformance -- think going forward . let put window business 2 thing . funny name : pro non-pro . let 's call commercial consumer effectively moment . commercial pc business , otherwise known pro , general outperformed market bit . tends little bit attach pro little bit better . one n't vary terribly far market . might -- , usually comment could inventory-related stuff . like , quarter bit pre buy . pro number little high couple point . 'll come back . people would ask , `` know ? '' well many buyer pc license world . see move little bit funny pattern , kind guess got couple week inventory specific oem . one , see move far commercial pc , long period time , kind single-digit grower . mean , even -- exception year -- couple year back '' end xp , get new computer '' moment , outside , steady , steady macro change ; steady even , different region , 's kind low single digit . consumer side far volatile . quarter first time 've actually in-line . consumer business tends bigger asp difference . skus consumer business commercial business . commercial business , got 2 ; 're different . n't tend ton asp movement commercial . consumer tend see big asp difference . device pretty healthy higher end market . see happen , tends mean 's higher asp associated . 'll see big delta unit look like revenue look like . -- 'll give opposite . low-end unit strong , happened couple year ago , opposite true . 'll see revenue far unit growth . tends pricing tier , anything else , wide difference pricing based -- think based price device . 's spec-ed -- device spec . think low-end shift , low-end device , think low price . think lot power , think high one consumer . got . obviously oﬃce 365 phenomenal success . think everybody tent would agree . walk u opportunity -- well , microsoft oﬃce 365 ? opportunity ? - amy e. hood q - philip alan winslow - amy e. hood microsoft 365 , think , realization customer perspective want modern experience machine -- second . whatever machine . modern experience defined characteristic . would -- importantly many cio ctos , would modern security plan modern management tool , like -- 'm sorry . could n't hear well . 's nice . 're thinking modern security modern management . people tend think oﬃce window quite separately , well em product actually built cloud enterprise division . really experience modern workplace modern desktop modern even phone experience oﬃce foundationally capability n't come oﬃce 365. finally said , well , n't sell thing customer actually ask u , , `` wait , what's secure environment ? '' would say , well , 's window 10 oﬃce 365. combination deployed together secure component . 've started call thing microsoft 365. would also world refer device modern . natural language ability understanding . natural input like gesture gaze . take 10 input . think broadest sense word wanted modern computing experience wanted interact device either normal keyboarding touch time . whether 's gaze , whether 's voice whether 's ink , attribute , application sit modern device . 'd find historically certain apps optimized ink , certain apps . want terrific modern experience , apps o device optimized really make meaningful difference think computing . think microsoft 365 , think broadest , inclusive , consistent experience application o ; build , including device spec . yes . made comment device , sort , whatever . 're thinking , 'd say , ﬂashback build , obviously keynote intelligent edge . talking containerization micro service -- device . car . thermostat . link back azure iot edge . opportunity ? obviously hear iot . hear intelligent device . microsoft play ? sort bring table , 'd say , maybe competitor n't ? well 'd say endpoint . people still want secure , manageable endpoint , especially 's going collect amount sensing data . want able update . secured want . story , u , window 10 story well azure iot story around connectivity device back data source . feel actually quite good investment 've made . think iot endpoint -- say edge , think broadest term , right , whether 's pc , right way interpret ; whether 's phone ; whether 's sensor ; q - philip alan winslow - amy e. hood q - philip alan winslow - amy e. hood q - philip alan winslow - amy e. hoodfrankly , whether 's edge network . would say compute need reside need reside application work best . even azure stack -- right -- even azure stack another way talking edge . u , think 's pretty -- 's world view , think specific product . 's product make possible run compute ass data capture data analyze data matter environment , right ? think could -- gaming may need close , although latency time getting good enough may need case . azure stack 's realization -- always cruise ship -- best visualization people understand 's clearly connected . 's good way think 's important compute need . got . got bunch question . 'm going ask one open audience . richard , hoping could -- associate , could grab mic , people raise hand , walk around . one question 've thinking 've asked year sort life cycle operational eﬃciency microsoft . mean think everybody room agrees , past , guess , 4-plus year , guess 18 quarter , think , cfo -- 's going 18th quarter ... yes , know . could n't count . 'm ... yes . 've finished 18 going 19. yes . let 's keep streak alive . -- -- think , operational eﬃciencies , kind talked life cycle first part focusing cost structure . spending much . thing need divested . period allocation . 'll call , le note , ( inaudible ) sort higher-return area . 've hit point started fade kind inched back towards , call , normalized investment growth . think life cycle process , call , operational eﬃciency microsoft ? tend give slightly -- 's something like . tend think 's much life cycle constant effort front , -- first thing said really picking business 're . 's first one . business . -- , . change , market change , competitive landscape change . suddenly maybe 's something q - philip alan winslow - amy e. hoodmake much sense used . still watch 'll make sure make sense . 're right , lot , would say , right business , feel like 's behind u . next piece , really continuing focus eﬃcient . 've done ton work think maybe easier approach . would say one 're pretty focused still . , like every company earth , opportunity reinvent many process , digitally ; eﬃcient build software , ship software , sell software hardware . feel like still opportunity run eﬃcient operation . fundamentally eﬃciency , 's customer experience better . tell people time -- eﬃciency work focused making better customer outcome , whether 's many commerce system need company recognize call ; many different customer interface . want -- modern build environment engineer . thing matter customer , whether 's internal employee whether 's external customer pay u money , benefit thoughtful , eﬃcient work , opposed saying , `` oh , see cost cut . '' 's good frame successful company . tend also think we've bit investor year key place . true year , -- think , look intelligent cloud . search investment . feel great 's paying top line . long see thing pay top line , really n't feel constrained term investing . invest operating expense , see land strong revenue growth , including share growth , top . know 've got structural gross margin improvement coming . 's good leverage model u , especially subscription business gift keep sort giving top line . model , feel like -- n't feel constrained way long continue execute spend thoughtfully . . industry aggressive . need aggressive . 've got good world view . 're executing well . team good . feel thing , last thing want aggressive . n't feel terribly worried . think whatever hope people inside company willingness aggressive front coupled stopping former 2 item , know well enough 's work , 's simply excellent company work . remind sort deep believer strategic patience execution urgency . believe 2 thing , understand going , invest patiently , invest right thing , watch pay . 're well , let 's fix . 's -- mean . 's hard . 's fun stuff , mean , . yes . 'm going totally steal line , way . 's like ... well 's good way think general . confusing two super important . actually really thoughtful strategic plan 're executing poorly , interpreted inside company bad strategy . -- change course . 's really -- waste time . waste cycle . importantly , waste energy people . opposite could also true . q - philip alan winslow q - unidentified participant - amy e. hoodyou bad strategy bad execution . say , `` , . 'm right . let fix thing . '' take much time . 're far away need positioned company . 're really , really damaging . spend lot time team thinking making sure we're distinguishing two . ultimately make much faster much better positioned customer success . kind -- 's important frame think expense growth . great , awesome . well 'll take , last 10 minute , question audience . raise hand one . ( rich ) walk mic . otherwise , 'll continue . ( alex ) , front ? maybe -- amy , go competitive dynamic public cloud . obviously , amazon first , 're larger . 've come done great job . 've got good enterprise . prem well taking advantage . maybe talk google may may pricing stuff like . yes . thanks , ( alex ) . 's -- get asked question lot . let talk sort 've seen . think feel good 've executed given think year ago aws . think structurally 've done good job aggressive investment . 've done good job finding differentiation hybrid beginning . fact , 're using strength enterprise focus try successful many sale investment already . think past year trajectory changer u front amazon . said , trust , live seattle , feel energy 2 successful company . 're looking core system engineer , . mean -- seattle region . hotbed world view public cloud going , private cloud going . -- 's -- 's fun place , frankly , feel . take comment progress spirit incredibly successful pairing company executing incredibly well ; executing , think , mutual focus customer success ; frankly , terribly different view world going . let start saying . see customer . see partner , isvs . feel like 've even made progress start-up community , knew would harder one u . 's bit new cycle . feel great . let 's talk google , think 've talking seeing market year . would say 've seen past quarter 'd seen . 's surprising . think 're making good effort . think diane greene excellent leader established enterprise ceo . know 's probably title job . . always winner . 's always successful . kind look say absolutely expect continue aggressive . absolutely expect see customer . think -- may see way , level way see amazon customer presence . 's different . would say certainly see used . would also say q - philip alan winslow - amy e. hood q - philip alan winslow - amy e. hood q - philip alan winslow q - unidentified participant - amy e. hoodcomments pretty u.s. europe centric . think , maybe go apac region , 'd probably say -- instead probably putting google third slot , 'd probably aggressively asking ali . 's different world view . think , sit half world , tend think 3 company named successful region . 's certainly true . europe see similar frame . went africa , certainly china , increasingly india across asia , 'd probably see alibaba different view moving outside china ; well funded , well capitalized , certainly aggressive , many attribute , understanding cloud , understanding they'd like take thing outside -- home region . 's thing would add competitively landscape global basis . got . right , think time one question get amy away -- wind front . 's -- 's actually -- 's humming . -- 's hard white noise i'm hearing . 'm making whatever question ask . 's like , `` think heard . '' think said something oﬃce . one -- one audience . otherwise , 'll -- , yes . topic tax reform looming , would curious prospect cash repatriation , would mean microsoft . specifically , could change think & strategy ? would -- let clear , wo n't change think & strategy . -- see asset make sense u ; feel 're fundamental growing business ; feel 're better owner someone else sit , fit , dictate whether deal make sense u . 's always bit like n't want wait tax reform return capital . n't want wait tax reform buy smart asset . many asset wo n't make sense le sense new environment . , think , structured think world . come think spending , think general , -- biggest capital spend data center . data center need built need built .
