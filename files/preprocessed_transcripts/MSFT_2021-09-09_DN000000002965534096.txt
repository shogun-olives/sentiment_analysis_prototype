's 've moved much functional model say key secret dynamic 365 individual service function . like said sale , service , marketing , finance , supply chain , operation commerce . common data service thread throughout , call data verse common data service allows able supply chain visibility seamlessly ﬂow commerce system , sale service application . silo function 's core value prop breaking traditional silo enabling data-first ai-first set application serve every business need . think 's intuitive would resonate still well customer prospect . maybe kind round value proposition think dynamic extend power platform , 've talked app gap past demand apps outstripping world supply software developer . sound like power apps lot momentum right . think population citizen developer world perhaps microsoft 's role expanding population ? yeah , two fundamental thing happening industry right . app gap one , every organization unique set need start base function . reality run business every day , specific application need run business . rate industry evolving market evolving , n't year build enterprise application anymore . 's -- landscape change quickly . q - brad zelnick - alysa taylorand , plus scarcity resource term number developer . see term citizen developer though 's really closest problem , empower tool able solve challenge ( inaudible ) . 's actually , touched power apps , portfolio called power platform , power apps allows build unique application quickly low-code no-code way , leveraging connector data source , bringing data data verse able quickly stand application . service power platform allow take data able automate well analyze power automate power bi . 's entire system low-code no-code tool enable citizen world able take care challenge ahead . reason we're investing much area want make sure people rapidly respond 's front empower everyone organization able -- tool give service need . -- 's pursuit making sure organization service need successful . make lot sense . alysa , , maybe , dig little bit power platform aspect , think rpa , 've got really strong technology . might think microsoft 's aspiration rpa space would characterize market 's maturity ultimately , size market opportunity ? think might debate maybe big beyond might obvious example , like account payable account receivable , often heard lot success , whether 'd microsoft rpa provider . mean , really ultimately automate away role typical knowledge worker ? going wake -- automation going mean ? well , think 's -- goal empower individual , definitely automate away . think organization need , actually freeing people higher-value task . much system -- automated give people ability focus higher-value task , 're productive . 's really -- think rpa enables people 's account receivable paper-based process . 's really function across organization highly manual repeatable task able automate . also help legacy-based system . actually sort automate task system -- 's diﬃcult able extract data system . think rpa power automate , microsoft cloud service , huge potential make individual productive also help organization win , back comment made scarcity resource really able help organization adapt might q - brad zelnick - alysa taylornot frontline worker able take task . 's - - 's really nice way organization become eﬃcient become productive . make lot sense . alysa maybe could , 'd like talk little bit go-to-market approach . microsoft vertical oriented approach market , fairness , think 's common across industry . make approach different ? product ? go-to-market perhaps even unique partnership specific vertical ? well , think 's -- would say 's . 've talked lot today hear product 've investing product side product strategy . conversely , go-to-market side , 've microsoft really re-imagined product strategy hand-in-hand go-to-market strategy . think want service customer . 's able start time need , whether organization rethinking making sale force proactive talked building digital contact center future rethinking customer experience , starting customer service , way get supply chain visibility modern commerce system . really able start organization time need that's -- go back notion 5 , 10 year ago crm erp , , mentioned , big monolithic system took year implement . , , 're trying get fastest time value customer . modular application allows organization time need able adopt . -- choose expand function , 've built way allows start application , easily add next service , data talked data verse connects application go-to-market 's around making sure organization able realize value application add additional workload see fit . , 've invested heavily sale field . year-over-year , we've added incremental -- significantly added incremental sale . built ecosystem think world-class continuing invest heavily isps able bring complementary vertical micro-vertical expertise round portfolio . also investing customer success making sure -- organization , way serve , way pre-sales post-sales feel supported microsoft ecosystem . -- equal investment engineering side building product strategy q - brad zelnick - alysa taylorthere go-to-market side make sure 're serving customer best way possible . key ingredient making work ecosystem , mind , impressive set partner . n't want say second none 'll offending company , clearly distinction microsoft sure . alysa , 'd love ask bit future trend look future , continue hear covid accelerating digital transformation investor trying distinguish change behavior enduring versus might short-lived get pandemic mean behind u , seeing along line term customer behavior intent ? expect translate end [ ph ] demand ? yeah , think covid , many way , accelerated organization ' need build strong digital foundation 's many -- talked curbside pickup , contactless shopping , disruption 've seen supply chain market , like organization strong cloud digital foundation one weathered storm , best . great example talking patagonia . patagonia shut store factory -- make sure employee , in-store factory safe . reopened modern distribution center able short period time . worked closely supply chain system well commerce system in-store point sale able bring employee back safe way , also serve customer safe way , use retail store fulfillment center versus factory large amount people working closely together using smaller footprint store able dropship . think covid unique circumstance like patagonia face . think pervasively , every organization come realize future proof whatever next , 's really incumbent build digital foundation allows react quickly . think thing see go future make sure physical digital world seamless think -- bunch digital capability stood stay . think 'll always mindful physical environment spacing footfall traﬃc monitor physical space . talked automation making sure employee productive eﬃcient possibly . think investment automation persist . quickly supply chain disrupted continue disrupted , making sure supply -- supply chain visibility , q - brad zelnick - alysa tayloryou responsive commerce system . thing continue see organization invest 's -- n't think go back world two year ago organization adopt continue make sure 're anticipating 's next . think 's doubt , experience continue digital , mixed reality . think future bright exciting , 's great see microsoft able help customer delivering type experience . couple question , maybe along line . surprised saw responsibility mixed reality realize use case pretty cool . customer like kroger noticed mercedes-benz even chevron using hololens dynamic drive better business outcome ? yeah , use two example think 're good contrast kind organization investing future organization react covid build future . chevron -- chevron , think need service oil -- oil mine field , , 's diﬃcult ﬂy people able onsite service . invested pre- covid able use hololens dynamic 365 remote assist able remote service allowing technician collaboratively work servicing oil rig , remote , mean like , talk remote , remote place . -- chevron -- sort ahead curve make sure eﬃcient possible react quickly obviously issue oil rig -- , fairly timely , becomes disastrous , right ? response time incredibly critical using mixed reality able . look mercedes-benz , response covid-19 , able technician ﬂy service vehicle . , using hololens dynamic 365 mixed reality application , remote assist guide training platform able bring together technician service vehicle able communicate vehicle owner . really unique way evolving service capability . think see persist future allows people real-time -- real-time collaboration , able knowledge share communicate customer wherever . 's value add mercedes continue invest think saw shutdown service plan people able get plane help really accelerate . mixed reality portfolio dynamic another way u , talked data-first . using form data , whether operational data , transactional data , observational data , bring data together able create -- create understanding customer , supply chain , employee really using data way able analyze garner insight . 's form q - brad zelnick - alysa taylor q - brad zelnick - alysa taylorof data 's mixed reality part -- strategic part portfolio , one help u serve customer like mercedes-benz , kroger chevron unique way . yeah , 's cool . actually privilege seeing mercedes ' new ev lineup day new york , interesting see ev market dominant player . maybe one last one , 've talked data , data , data , believe 've mentioned data verse single data model . anything understand much underlying fabric upon everything 're relies make everything possible bringing overall platform solution available customer ? anything tell u ? something maybe one day productized monetized ? well , 'll give little preview 're headed -- data cloud service think data need every organization , 's analytical data store take unstructured data able combine unstructured data using common data model able analyze . analytical data service azure synapse -- microsoft azure synapse . think operational data service -- comprise convert -- bringing operational data structured unstructured . one operational data service data verse low-code no-code . 's -- think managed service allows controlled aligned entity way able easily build new application power apps , able automate data power automate , able combine data across service like dynamic 365. obviously azure sql hero enterprise operational data service cosmos db able build cloud-native application . think analytical data service synapse , operational data service right operational data service wrappering [ ph ] compliance governance microsoft purview . that's really kind construct data cloud 'll hear u talk comprised -- believe comprehensive set data service organization garner value common data model allows data either operational structured form , also able unstructured data synapse data kind part microsoft cloud data service . make perfect sense . ... q - brad zelnick - alysa taylor q - brad zelnick - alysa taylor ( multiple speaker ) 'll talk 'll hear u talk microsoft data cloud service work together . wanted give sense data verse fit overall strategy picture . look forward . , alysa , thank much joining u . final thought anything leave u ? think 're close time . think n't touch industry . think 's something 'll see u . 've introduced first set industry cloud . talk microsoft cloud able make sure microsoft cloud relevant every industry area continue invest well . would say -- thank much . 's always pleasure talk 're across business application , great discussion around ability organization leverage data new way , we're building future , think industry , u , making cloud service industry-relevant another area 'll continue see u invest . awesome . well , , thank much , thanks everybody joining . hope see soon . great day . thank .
