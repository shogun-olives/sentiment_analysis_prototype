welcome back everyone . 's brent thill software team jefferies . happy u scott guthrie , evp microsoft cloud ai . scott , real pleasure . 're coming almost quarter century microsoft , incredible journey . maybe tell u little bit story journey kind bring u 're microsoft cloud ? everyone want hear kind perspective 's important point would take away perspective . yeah . 's -- quarter century long time . 've done lot different thing microsoft , involved first azure microsoft cloud broadly , guess , 10 year . , kind brought early satya work azure joined cloud business enterprise business 2011. ( inaudible ) routine satya became ceo , took role , head called cloud enterprise . kind evolved microsoft product portfolio since . , 'm responsible microsoft azure , dynamic 365 , power platform , thing like github visual studio developer tool , thing like hololens , whole window operating system bunch stuff , 's fun ride . yeah , think make microsoft cloud unique breadth portfolio , 'll walk bunch thing . interesting individually , put together , 's also magic happens 're really excited kind drive customer success forward going future . question answer ( question answer ) - scott guthrie q - brent thill - scott guthrieand unique advantage point cloud trend 18 month ago . satya said saw three year worth digital transformation two month . digital transformation evolving ? seeing think next year ? yeah . think even covid , seeing talking digital transformation , idea sort buying technology , really using technology change fundamental business , really built microsoft cloud without mind , term stitching together whether collaboration employee , whether 's supply chain management , whether infrastructure obviously azure , whether 's developer tool business github visual studio . 's thinking help organization transform obviously covid happened . would say lot gasoline got poured fire digital transformation , business went thinking digital transformation something priority , live today suddenly -- covid , suddenly became -- existential even stay business . , early day , retailer trying figure significantly accelerate online omni-channel experience open store . employee trying figure work home collaborate productively employee longer physically ever oﬃce . security model look like ? make sure n't -- keep employee engagement employee successful . think evolved recently thing like supply chain management . get -- adapt supply chain world lot gap lot crisis navigate way . think 're also seeing even employee moving company , lot company realizing need recruit , need retain , need kind keep re-skilling thing like linkedin talent management business , think help . think , 're going see continue evolve . new area given year think hot spot particularly high focus company . think general , covid effectively accelerated digital transformation change think really put technology center literally every company , technology company , retailer , financial service , manufacturing , consumer product , everyone 's trying figure , use technology really reinvent business ? think 's - 's exciting time obviously someone sell platform tool application help , 's hopefully good time also business perspective . think decentralization theme kind -- question around , view importance edge computing see playing vital role going forward ? well , think , one trend 's happening , mentioned couple like general retail supply chain management , key thing covid organization trying kind reinvent thing . case going case 're changing business process , 're using cloud infrastructure , 're still fundamentally entering data screen somewhere , track shipment track many people -- store open many people store store manager typing . think place 're going world world 's ﬂowing real time . way many people store camera camera counting real time many people store , like browsing ? shelf look like ? -- item hot need activate supply chain inventory n't run yet , look like lot people hovering around area . 's hot deprioritize ? real-time going possible world literally everything ip address iot real-time signal going able gathered , accelerated cloud insight going able derived . 's big part portfolio enables 're starting see organization adopt deeper way . get information , think organization also realizing , push compute back edge provide better experience store provide better experience say , car vehicle sell . provide better experience inside home ? 's going require edge computing . customer one example would someone like vw , group , make volkswagen branded car , porsche audi skoda whole bunch brand . want know car problem customer call . much better experience , hey , detect 's problem , 're going reach 're even going say , hey , would like schedule appointment fix ? , click 1 correspond sm term appointment time work . kind enable type feedback look , 're using azure microsoft cloud inside hard data center central coordination . they're actually running azure , starting vehicle next year actually vehicle . , literally every one vw vehicle , number one manufacturer car world actually embedded , embedded version azure actually running car , 's driving intelligence driving customer experience directly vehicle . think 're going see high volume high value item like car , , quickly . lot -- every manufacturer think going . time , 're going see coffee machine . 're working folk like starbucks , barista even iot chip starbucks coffee grinder coffee machine starbucks ﬂow new recipe new tuning coffee shop . 's another example kind iot workload 's fairly modern , fairly new 're going see q - brent thill - scott guthriecertainly healthcare big part acquisition announced earlier year nuance around , even enable ai enable data edge computing occur doctor 's oﬃce better patient- doctor experience 're going talking physician . , think we're going see trend continue part going cloud infrastructure , also thing get connected , 's also going local compute local processing edge , holistically security perspective management perspective trust perspective developer perspective , key thing we're focusing think microsoft cloud make much better . achieve vision volkswagen bus azure , mean , security going vital component . think spend considerable amount dollar driven lot attention initiative . high-level talk 's happening around security compliance ? seems like 've really come long way least since 've covering many year , question big driver . yeah . mean 's -- think 's couple element security aspect . think one keep investing -- security product service given running world top microsoft cloud . , everything make sure build run incredibly secure table stake everyone . think thing enable customer 're using product service , also use capability 're implementing , business specific logic behavior 're interoperating [ ph ] product , including non-microsoft product , security vendor help protect broader sense ? end day , everything right protect product , customer end misusing misconfiguring something unsafe , still problem . , big part focus last couple year building microsoft security portfolio . thing like azure sentinel azure defender m365 defender gotten incredibly mature . gartner forrester two kind independent analyst firm kind rate vendor . 're leader five gartner magic quadrant seven forrester wave . security vendor 12 leadership position across many security category 's big change u versus say five six year ago n't think . , think 's resonating well analyst particular customer . think talked beginning year 've passed $ 10 billion annual revenue security product alone accelerating growing , fast . think -- , 're going continue see u investing , think increasingly 's going around even take example , know there's lot financial analyst watching conference today . thinking compliance inside organization , identify insider risk ? identify potentially behavior insider trading thing like ? historically , q - brent thill - scott guthriebespoke service . 's awful lot human looking data manually try detect . new compliance tool oﬃce , help make lot easier even kind detect device accessing data , information shared , et cetera . example problem think new tam 're creating solve real customer problem obviously use technology make u secure . think last thing 'll mention security side think resonating well trust world 're digital transformation , security paramount , ability u give tool help secure paramount , also trust microsoft paramount . world 're providing data cloud vendor , 's data like raw data base , like real business data 's supply chain , customer data connecting trust really matter security side , also like trust vendor use data purpose . think 's area also differentiate versus google amazon facebook consumer-facing business use data different way , sometimes compete directly lot enterprise . , yeah , think third element something also , 's sort bit intangible , think definitely resonates talk say ( inaudible ) trying make technology bed really strategic business partner technology bed , want know trust . 're unique vendor mentioned hybrid strategy . on-prem business probably exceeded expectation sustaining really good growth . obviously , azure phenomenal concept hybrid , many , kept on-prem business well cloud growing ? 's happening perspective ? think one thing 's great strength fact n't -- 've historically , incredibly strong on-premise business , think 60 % server world on-premises run window server . 're number one database vendor sql server on-premises well . , yeah , obviously window client device , 're strong well come productivity software end user software . , 've large , successful presence lot trust built customer . , think part magic make sure provide easy way customer keep using technology on-prem . easily take advantage cloud cloud-based technology well ? enable seamless ability run mode 're going long time ? think , probably would le ( inaudible ) 're going enable cloud try keep everyone prem . know 10 year ago could done , sort said , , think world moving cloud , 's moving decentralized computing model . q - brent thill - scott guthrielet 's fight . instead , let 's really invest , make sure on-prem product really easily moved cloud 's unique thing azure oﬃce 365 power platform dynamic platform github really run multi-cloud , hybrid mode . force use cloud . level integration , whether around security , whether 's around identity , whether 's around management tool , whether 's around patching back thing care lot , resonated 've earned customer trust . 's big reason success microsoft cloud , importantly 's meant people still want keep paying u on-prem software lot capability get better move cloud . , 's kind think win-win customer happy help u business-wise well . happy customer always good . speaking seems happy customer would , & recently choosing run 5g core network public cloud . 's pretty strong testament say , hey , 're going bank run backbone . guess , 's kind multiple thread people want pull opportunity could see telco . kind 're working azure go , seems like answer 's all-terrain vehicle go anywhere . maybe address want , seems like big endorsement . yeah . think . mean , think something ( inaudible ) moment , telco operator industry . think gsma sort estimated 're going spend $ 1.1 trillion capital expenditure upgrading equipment , upgrading service three-quarters spent 5g . , 's trend 's sort independent movement microsoft that's happening industry . think operator 're , they're telling , okay , 're lot capital expenditure 're rebuild launch new service . want able eﬃciently possible . think 's lot money really want agility . 're thinking , okay , deploy lot compute , lot data center high agility , public cloud correct way . , think 's wave interest wave spending 's coming , think part 've working make sure position microsoft cloud , like branding perspective , really capability perspective best public cloud enabling . set acquisition last year right pandemic starting . , mean company sort cut back & way accelerated said , look , think 5g going big thing . , bought aﬃrmed network metaswitch two company provide service lot telco specifically help run core network , space microsoft historically lot experience . brought tremendous amount knowledge helped u helping u build set capability directly azure think barely differentiated . think & announcement tremendous endorsement , & q - brent thill - scott guthrie q - brent thill - scott guthrieone largest operator world , 're also seen operator thought leader trendsetter . , fact 're betting u kind run core network help really build 5g capability , think going help u tremendously make successful . operator reaching saying , hey , love something similar . , think probably example place 're continually growing tam opportunity total addressable market opportunity way maybe five year ago , n't think would area people even think tam . think tam 's lot tam 're going continue see u invest aggressively . know one 's hard , everyone asks ( inaudible ) cloud journey , analogy easy use ? n't know frame . guess said telco , trillion dollar opportunity , 've got long way go however slice . way frame kind journey ? well , 's hard think kind mentioned telco opportunity , think , pie keep getting bigger 's 're kind like converting journey . 's journey know take , example , enterprise , think 're 20 % way . 's awful lot roadmap ahead taking , kind traditional enterprise public cloud workload maybe would thought two three year ago , term moving cloud , 's lot upside . think bigger upside new thing emerged part calculus historically . people say 20 % way , 's like 5g operator , 's iot particular , thinking factory ﬂoors ot data , system . , 's traditionally thought part public cloud . think 's new way using data , new experience going get build . , expect new pocket tam emerge year ahead . , 's exciting time 's lot opportunity , 's lot potential upside . tying back original question around digital transformation , great thing directly -- investment helping business . , get great feedback cycle see business benefit want invest . , think going good set year ahead excited journey . last question . mentioned hololens earlier one role oversee 's lot talk metaverse zuckerberg talked lot next generation internet . guess look enterprise opportunity consumer opportunity pretty incredible . guess , framed metaverse opportunity 're , - - give u high level quick overview 've seen far ? q - brent thill - scott guthrie q - brent thillyeah , mean think thing ar vr , 're cusp . , mean think look 're hololens , example , commercial , 's great example 're using manufacturing , 're using healthcare , mean , doctor go covid ward oﬃce actually see lot patient quickly . lot hospital system u.s. right unfortunately n't used . 's example , said leading edge solution , 's still custom , meaning 's mainstream yet , 're starting see people use . think form factor get -- move kind goggles kind something little bit like glass probably we're going two three year , 's 're going start see mainstream ability see world around socially acceptable set headgear , time , able see thing user able kind richer experience going transform think fundamentally live life . think , say 15 year ago , n't see people cell phone restaurant , saw people talking . go restaurant , everyone 's phone seems like sometimes . think new world 're moving going new compute paradigm 're going see lot people replace phone per se , 're definitely going new pattern experience 15 year , 'll feel obvious way today spending lot time phone feel obvious . part play really around , best commercial vendor ? 're lot commercial application . might seen announcement 're u.s. army around program called iva , focusing public sector workload well . large contract 's going push technology challenging way help u build better tech . , 's definitely going consumer aspect 'll participate well . company , think whether 's u , facebook , apple others going play set card play set ( inaudible ) move based strength also add unique value 'll see u well . scott , really appreciate joining , honor congrats momentum . thanks part conference . thanks much really appreciate . thank .
