, skin green ? 'm sorry ? skin green ? yeah , maybe . n't know . 'll find afterwards , huh ? right . , n't go ahead get started ? 'm aaron rakers . 'm semiconductor hardware analyst well fargo , extremely excited host discussion colette kress , cfo nvidia . start , though , colette , 'm going throw little fact , right ? 10 year . actually , september 10-year anniversary . point joined , company $ 4 billion revenue trailing 12 month . 're $ 45 billion , roughly , right ? market cap 's gone $ 9 billion $ 1.2 trillion . , 'm going start saying , good work . congrats . phenomenal run . , keep going . n't take foot pedal . start question , collette , think get joy reading safe harbor , think might prepared comment well . i'll kick . colette kress sound great . thank , aaron , u . opening statement , let first say . reminder , presentation contains forward-looking statement , investor advised read report filed sec information related risk uncertainty facing business . okay . , enjoy coming event . let kind start thing seeing nvidia . last part year important time ? important time related really change see data center computing going forward , rise generative ai really created new paradigm front u see accelerated computing ai computing thrust lot computing going forward . 's enormous installed base right , $ 1 trillion compute type last several decade . opportunity people see sustainability move forward eï¬ƒcient way computing , also transact using ai , ai u almost everything . 's statement say beginning journey . huge opportunity front u , look forward come . yes , gave earnings right thanksgiving holiday show strong growth , sequentially year-over-year growth company across market platform . standout , course , data center compute . data center compute reached record level , , training inferencing , also gpu sale system , also networking . reaching customer every day term work . strength stem consumer internet company lot enterprise . let 's forget csps , also growing last quarter , continuing see specialized regional csps also grow . wanted start beginning statement , 'll turn back , aaron . question answer - colette kress q - aaron rakers - colette kress q - aaron rakers - colette kress ( question answer ) 's perfect . , 'm going -- 've got -- n't know , 50 question , 're going try get many . inevitable question always get , fiscal 1q '25 look like ? think know answer , maybe 'll start , kind help u characterize balance imbalance , say , current supply demand environment , nvidia , think dynamic lead time higher-end skus start progress think progressing move forward ? important look last year ability scale company size revenue . folk really looking , must easy process . took lot work working many supply channel , ordering supply , keep mind 's also ordering capacity . long-term relationship really helpful u able scale fast 've . unfortunately , still supply-constrained , though , 's going take u little yet u catch . plan term scaling supply year quarter , also plan go '25 . 're making meaningful progress term catching supply . many folk look ordering seeing inventory , keep mind , much many different duration , duration term need today , also procuring solidifying capacity term long term . 're track next year make meaningful progress right term supply demand . time serving demand , also bringing new product market . new product market therefore surfaced onset demand coming next set product . know 'll talk . yeah . 's perfect . know , mentioned , right , like like add purchase commitment inventory prepaid capacity , 's like grew 40 % sequentially last quarter . point would expect continue grow sequentially next handful quarter . correct . q - aaron rakers - colette kress q - aaron rakers - colette kress kind away supply side , demand side , guess , , view visibility changed , demand visibility see , demand shaping ? second piece question , think last quarter talked last week , talked little bit product cycle , cadence product cycle important variable consider product visibility . maybe help u appreciate little bit . think back time many different architecture generation 've gone seeing today , relationship customer grown stronger stronger . relationship come helping think plan build term data center , 's longstanding discussion help u work exact configuration need , also help u demand visibility . work continues every day . think long would take build data center , beginning day one planning standing , 's likely year well-seasoned team built data center . already seeing work begin term next year , want build ? bringing together existing portfolio , new portfolio product coming , build relationship demand go forward . , 'll continue process . visibility strong . talk visibility , one customer knowing supply knew help u plan . needed provide u deep understanding essentially po perspective . , 'll continue path right new product maintain process understanding demand . yeah . finer point , look slide deck 've put investor relation website , kind outline cadence product cycle , right ? 's -- look like 's le year cadence , whereas past , might -- much longer cadence . , 's part visibility discussion customer asking kind cadence product cycle , fair ? 's correct . additionally , market advanced much , complexity type ai solution folk working , would love see something new new plan . q - aaron rakers - colette kress q - aaron rakers - colette kressand u work different product even architecture well architecture going forward faster cadence , helpful . helpful planning , also support new project 're . 's perfect . shifting gear little bit , competitive landscape -- often get question 's one competitor launch product next week . seems narrative around like hyperscale cloud guy . know aws trainium 2 week announcement . 've seen microsoft announced recently . characterize competitive landscape 're seeing data center ? think work done , still step back help folk understand n't build specific product n't build chip , built full stack . built many time full data center . data center computing minute information data enters data center . work nvidia , nvidia system , nvidia 's networking , nvidia 's overall software stack , full system software really close application get . help people build model . help people correct model . 's work . competitive hard look n't anything apples-to- apple term 're . 're , different . specific chip may help certain specific workload . reason customer continue turn u tco saving purchasing full stack n't require significant amount resource would add top received chip . work continues u help support tco effort . think type solution coming market , 're great . , , position merrier , 's fine . know tco going number-one goal many customer today . lot time 'll field question 's cuda , 's 4.8 million developer , 's stack . 's much deeper , right ? 's -- think tend get lost cuda stickiness , fair assessment ? 's much cuda layer . think onset cuda , cuda development platform that's every single one gpus close 15 year , building strong development platform community joined development platform . everything gpus today backward- compatible forward-compatibility . every customer know . changed generation architecture new generation . everything still working . q - aaron rakers - colette kresswe also think would development community like . like developer much work built time . somebody would rebuild . position full end-to-end solution one overall argue , understand continue innovate going forward . count u next year , yes , going thinking new product market well . want go layer stack strategy minute , networking , software , definitely want touch . go , wanted ask china restriction . recent round , know last week mentioned , look , 're going solution adhere restriction selling china within , quote-unquote , month . also mentioned though , china contribution would , quote- unquote , significantly quarter . help u think cadence . like , -- kind take full china business expectation quarter ? start see come back solution come market . think next quarter two ? u.s. export control time quite detailed , quite long , took really thinking move forward help china customer . china still big market , u much industry whole . look export control , carefully go option would approve . 's new set area say notify review government . 's area say carry , fine china . want make sure understanding relationship u.s. government remains solid . 've created great understanding need , want make sure 're following . keep mind , china customer want well . bring new product , want know u.s. government also agrees . 're working right term design think could . certainly talk u.s. government make sure also aligned . given , unknown defined time , correct . 're looking part provided outlook q4 . sequential decline see china , keep mind , still selling gaming business . still bill part data center business sell term . would significant change quarter . going forward , . 'll support china approval understanding u.s. government . q - aaron rakers - colette kress q - aaron rakers - colette kress q - aaron rakers - colette kress dialogue round , relative restriction , bandwidth- oriented first kind restriction ? dialogue u.s. government changed ? deepened , far engagement solution fall threshold restriction ? given complexity market , given complexity semiconductor whole , complexity ai , yes , much thorough discussion side . yes . far cadence , said month , right ? far new solution china market . 're working fast . got , okay . let 's go stack little bit . topic 've written lot , given coverage universe , networking business , think people really starting see significance . put context , bought mellanox , business running $ 1.3 billion revenue . think math 's remotely right , $ 2.6 billion even $ 2.7 billion revenue networking . know jensen endorsed $ 10 billion plus annualized revenue last quarter . help u appreciate little bit . first , want know much infiniband , 'm going get spectrum-x see evolving far even deepening networking strategy ? yeah , great question regarding networking . time completed acquisition , one thing know match culture , match culture term team worked innovation , thinking future would , really basis data center high-performance computing , similar 've done . 're pleased term well acquisition helped solution customer partnership across many peer israel . work , 're correct , 've reached annual run rate nearly $ 10 billion term networking . looking there's sizable amount together selling gpu system selling network together . q - aaron rakers - colette kress q - aaron rakers - colette kressthey look high-end networking solution . ? 're best-of- the-breeds accelerated computing also ai solution . ai , training inferencing , importance infiniband standard large cluster , key . infiniband also grown even faster total networking business . large customer using installing throughout , 's important part process building data center . need also understand ethernet accelerated computing ai also key . spectrum-x coming new calendar year . high speed , moving 400-gig 800-gig , , key , based ethernet . ethernet important enterprise multi-tenancy type data center , know important piece . 're going able really manage industry . colette , 's debate infiniband , ethernet , ethernet replace infiniband . look spectrum-x accretive business either ? play different piece ai stack ? think lot white paper talk delineates ai factory versus ai cloud , seems like might delineation ethernet versus infiniband . maybe help u understand one play accretive model ? 's absolutely accretive . taken away . infiniband , , standard many . opening ethernet , 's addition term key place . 's true think ai factory . standardize versus standardize , example , supercomputer built ai . thinking traï¬ƒc coming data center , particularly large inferencing platform , traï¬ƒc traï¬ƒc mitigation , infiniband new spectrum-x really , really , really work manage traï¬ƒc challenge may . yes , 's perfect . , 's q1 , come . 've announced partnership dell server ecosystem . okay , great . kind sticking product portfolio , announcement week , aws first deployer , think , gh200 . 's grace hopper , combination arm-based cpu hopper gpu . talk little bit fit strategy . grace hopper look like start think piece product portfolio going forward ? q - aaron rakers - colette kress q - aaron rakers - colette kresscorrect . came grace hopper 200 , started shipping within q3 . q3 many supercomputer design win . begun shipping . grace hopper200 amazon aws ec2 set . , important also take create full supercomputer dedicated able keep 32 gpus together working , well new revised nvlink within . yet new product introduction . 're excited work aws . standing first gh200 csp . also opportunity working u dgx cloud gh200 well . working customer software solution using gh200 great opportunity using grace cpu , also complete faster performance whole term . going grace hopper , gh200 , gh300 , whatever subsequent version might look like , grace ? market arm-based cpu nvidia ? opportunity grace . opportunity grace . new product scenario could see data center , likely see opportunity grace well . 's perfect . want shift software , something 've also written lot . think reason writing hear becoming vocal , right ? talked last quarter , 's pace hit $ 1 billion arr . walk u software monetization nvidia ? like big driver certainly 'll question , walk u key driver software side . talk software important reason , , people choose stack success work 're successful . year software building , software come every gpu , even though foreseen part invoice . say we'll provide term free . important work 're , 's new opportunity u look software monetization well , 's reason . work enterprise . true end customer enterprise around world shape size work . q - aaron rakers - colette kress q - aaron rakers - colette kresswhen building accelerated solution ai need help likely staffed significant amount software engineer , software stack essential . 's essential thing already pre-built , pre-designed work structure . could also turn u term help , assistance fixing model , optimizing model , additional work new project may able . enterprise focused term seeing ai computing frame see computing 's data center . important software leverage work vmware , enterprise leverage vmware manage operate data center , different workload . key u key part see data center future becoming big portion accelerated ai . enterprise looking solution say 's accountable keeping software ? providing security platform ? create trusting relationship ? monetizes . 's something actually sell piece . nvidia aie software platform , essentially ai operating system enterprise big part software probably going forward . different component well . omniverse key component let 's forgot -- forget av software automotive u . thing scale type customer infrastructure . people install infrastructure , operating system important important use . think $ 1 billion arr year , fair say overwhelming majority , unless want give number , n't think , overwhelming majority aie , ai enterprise software today ? 's lot different piece , associated what's going data center lot different data center component . 's interesting , think consumption model cloud partner ? , look , 've got oracle , microsoft , azure , google , week , dgx aws well . consumed cloud partner consumed traditional enterprise on-premise infrastructure ? yeah . great thing 's consumed almost every form channel think . term , 'm going self-design odm dell hp , 'm going cloud credit work cloud q - aaron rakers - colette kress q - aaron rakers - colette kress q - aaron rakers - colette kress q - aaron rakerscustomers download software term , opportunity procure software . making easy integration , pretty much get lot different place . cloud guy , price per gpu per hour . 's correct . fast model . . look . somewhere range $ 4,500 $ 5,000 per year per gpu type load . somewhere range 're looking . okay . 've asked many time conference call stuff . one metric guy talk multi-year cloud service agreement number . 's internal usage . lot might internal usage , right ? 'm always looking leading indicator software side . actually potential payment cloud partner infrastructure software . actually -- fair assessment . cloud service agreement , like every enterprise . cloud service agreement serve many different us . ability stand cloud understand enterprise facing , using test software , test future solution , work new use case product . time . -- right centered around internal use . building dgx cloud established space within csps . customer coming enterprise say 'd like dgx cloud , move across multiple different csps . one , 're almost . help quickly come market product solution . two real quick , software side . omniverse , want say , memory 's right , kind initially introduced back latter part '21-ish timeframe , maybe 'm year old , n't know . n't remember , progression software piece ? take little bit longer , 's significant change . - colette kress q - aaron rakers - colette kress q - aaron rakers - colette kress 's great progress already term 're seeing omniverse . working large manufacturing factory type build . importance work need redesign and/or initially design one factory eï¬ƒciency . using omniverse clearly . many large car company car manufacturer really looking omniverse help . see almost type factory built , industrial type factory warehousing . redesign ? ability create complete digital twin existing and/or future without going full prototype building making large error using omniverse environment . happens , every day , type us come omniverse add many different prescription need work . 's always going added . continuous evolution . 's 3d type view versus 2d used much term design build essential . , yes , 're pleased progress 'll continue see future . final thing software , automotive , still thinking like mercedes ï¬‚agship , jaguar land rover ï¬‚agship 2025 , 2026 timeframe ? absolutely . busy working , yes , 's expect pilot start also full ï¬‚eet company . , 've got 3.5 minute left . 'm going maybe rapid fire couple quick question . , mix huge driver business . think gross margin go ? mean , 's remarkable , right ? 're 75 % gross margin . think trajectory gross margin ? seems like data center mix continue go higher . software going layer top . think ? yeah . , think gross margin , although important metric many u p & l , keep mind n't capture everything talk asp think actual manufacturing cost . really manufacturing cost included work term designing software many and/or full engineering work many solution keep giving even q - aaron rakers - colette kress q - aaron rakersshipped product , n't easily get represented . still opec . 's metric 's important metric . 75 given size data center business , seeing company margin data center margin kind seeing company total mostly data center . believe level stay continuation , point , probably software software adding . think pretty much seeing data center one . 's perfect . quick question want ask actually , last quarter , $ 18 plus billion cash balance sheet , think everybody look model say guy going generate lot cash . think strategic & , like platform strategy , mellanox home run , obviously armed play , think balance strategic , maybe platform expanding & activity company ? yeah , 'd say first stepping back , cash allocation top priority make sure think right avenue want apply cash . always going first investment back business , whether capital back , whether opex . investing business innovation right first write-off going number one use cash . secondly , want make sure investor get portion , want make sure dilution associated equity provide employee . equity employee important . important part compensation . want keep dilution ï¬‚at possible . , look term investment every single day , investment learn many company term work , also working company , opportunity & . 's hard found perfect mellanox past think would easy find . 's new environment term right & environment , n't mean still look . look term smaller company , team bringing unique ad company , would something 'll look time . 've got literally 12 second left , 10. 'm going ask one pointed question , , talk hundred investor earnings , right ? -- 're , -- earnings n't end , go something else . 's continual ï¬‚ywheel discussion . surprised people n't asking ? topic 're like , man , 'm surprised 'm getting question ? would ? - colette kress q - aaron rakers - colette kress surprise question getting . well , would look goal term earnings reason , talk like make sure clarity product , clarity term accelerating computing growth important part u . believe question mainly surround little bit detail add , gotten clear understanding , generative ai , significant change focus enterprise around world , focusing building ai solution enterprise . enterprise look say future using enterprise ai , otherwise able compete market . 's pretty big market go work . important think focus sovereign ai come forth . folk asked , mean ? probably important key understanding . 're speaking , 're u.s. see chatgpt . chatgpt u.s. culture , u.s. data , u.s. way think . every nation and/or region want thing . also know would therefore proprietary data information well . speak many different enterprise work right add ai , working many region also build need . collette , 're time . appreciate joining u morning . thank much . thank .
