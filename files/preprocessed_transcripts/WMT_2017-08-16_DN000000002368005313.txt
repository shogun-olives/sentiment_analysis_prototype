're going move conversation discussion trend 've mentioned bill bishop tim barrett jennifer bartashus tim barrettfar . let 's talk seriousness threat hard discount pose food retail industry . retailer pose threat ? risk ? time take discounter seriously . bill , want weigh ? sure , let start . threat . think answer could tell opening remark hard discount business model inherently eï¬ƒcient massive supermarket model 've lived 50 year . basically deliver product lower cost consequently lower price . light demographic tim shared u , find -- understand 's compelling . risk , undifferentiated store store basically shop they're convenience -- 's -- 're convenient , 's reason go . well store appeal primarily low price , ca n't match price hard discounter . mean lot sort softer discounter would vulnerable ? think step back look lot major market 're well recognized involved major revitalization store triggered concern lidl . 're busy disrupting quite store . lidl come town store bigger run around world , 38,000 square foot , 's close typical supermarket experience store offering frankly getting closer u customer experience shopping supermarket . 's like supermarket lot lower price . tim would want add ? yeah , 's great answer , ton add . guess bill covered supply side kind argument , 'll cover demand sort people really looking obviously , 's 're claiming way stretch dollar still . discounter offering next finely tuned private label . n't really sacrifice quality people used expect store brand 're starting realize maybe paying name brand n't always worth n't sacrifice quality lower price discounter offer le . 're going -- 've well going keep well expand even aggressively . alright , great let 's see , next question could hard discounter achieve sort penetration level -- u 've seen europe ? n't start . bill bishop jennifer bartashusyeah , great question . lot nuance think main reason europe n't walmart walmart low price leader u . got lock certain town , certain -- like whole kind county , part nation , really got competitive mode around area 've got scale 've got ability compete price little bit better lot european discounter . also -- also grocer actually -- fighting back already . high profile -- -- slightly high profile , follow kroger case 've suing lidl name private label brand . well , seems delay tactic anything else show grocer willing put fight . lot scale recent year expanding private label kind greater range store brand higher quality brand . competition lot tighter . n't think we'll necessarily see penetration get high europe . said , discounter eat edge , becoming lot closer u consumer expect store , lower price like bill talked . imagine still great amount share get , 're 3 % nowadays . could easily get 10 , think . 'll see , interesting matter . definitely grow . bill think ? well , lot respect number 've got experience , 'm coming little differently . seeing hard discounter actually grow share thoroughly significantly u 're expecting . mainly interaction two thing , one low price ï¬‚og pretty strongly . frankly something 's hard appreciate think hard many people call appreciate million million u household experienced income growth even negative income growth last x-number year folk may may buying paycheck paycheck , low grocery price appeal significant fraction . kind interpreting slightly response side huge sensitivity , think walmart able compete long-term price basis hard discounter . successful , compete hard discounter . , 'm willing suggest tim , meet sometime couple year , share hard discounter could actually approach 20 % sometime future u , given demographic nature competition , time tell . right . guess , would throw , strength weakness aldi lidl ? summarize change 've done order compete u environment format threatens grocer ? bill , want grab one ? bill bishop tim barrett jennifer bartashus tim barrett sure . strength weakness , strength , low price shoppable , smaller shoppable store , lot people like small size . weakness , limited access advertised brand . question , hold back . requirement heavier customer participation , particularly checkout process . think asked little bit change making well . think -- semantics get diï¬ƒcult . hard discounter hard discounter , offering around -- offering softer shopping experience case aldi lidl . think 's making closer u supermarket shopping experience . guess tim got additional thought well . yeah , would say -- would started -- especially 'd asked year ago , store n't quite nice . something they're actively working . think weakness long move kind little bit softer discount model . think another weakness also temporary , fact brand model -- brand model still largely unfamiliar shopper . got little bit aggressive advertising making sure people know maybe kind lack personnel store organized might expect find . familiarization , take little bit time , also think , 's short- term weakness anything else . cover kind main weakness . think one also minor interesting strength lot focus grocery , really cool non-foods section rotate real quickly . mean talked turnover thing move -- sometimes weekly basis always really good deal often hear people talk way evokes someone like t.j. maxx ask kind appeal 's treasure hunting vibe . never really know 's going . know 've gone store one day 've got lawn care equipment next day , really cheap lcd tv kitchenware . stuff move really quickly kind creates interesting competitive advantage . right . let 's talk little bit quality perception . quality perception private label brand adoption multi-tiered offering really changed consumer acceptance product . mean hard discount growth opportunity u ? tim , want think -- want give thought ? 'll , jen . think usage private label huge , particularly , really striking iron hot . store brand stigma fraction jennifer bartashus bill bishop jennifer bartashus bill bishopused think big thing attribute kind move towards fantasy brand . unaware fantasy brand -- private label like store brand 're called something else . good example like nice ! walgreens farm [ ph ] target private label -- store brand name . sometimes people n't even know 're buying private label buy realize actually pretty good keep buying whether learn 's store . aldi lidl decade . 're able get past kind -- helping move u past store brand stigma people buying realizing odds pretty -- good pretty quality -- high quality . continuing buy private level penetration increase kind going ride wave greater share greater growth u . bill , thought ? think tim set . totally agree . right . national brand ? sort role national brand play longer term ramification national brand manufacturer result growth hard discount . bill , think ? well , term role play today , 's pretty interesting course chance really studied aldi lidl . case aldi , included fill unique need product niche really diï¬ƒcult satisfy otherwise might prompt customer go another store buy brand . 're filling unique need . also provide really nice role term illustrating price advantage hard discounter . 've seen one question come soft drink . case soft drink , 'm going concentrate aldi see . seems exclusive arrangement brand point view coca cola aldi 're probably coca cola 50 different item package red black white label , maybe three four max aldi store , decent price great saving making private label look extremely attractive . , longer term , believe consumer-centric orientation retailer label private label fantasy label -- going take considerable share far , private label far name brand , effect undermine nature business relationship national name brand traditional grocer . said relationship , financial relationship undermined . frankly , tim barrett jennifer bartashus tim barrettboth become le inï¬‚uences market , least 's see right . tim ? yeah , 's -- 's pretty great . mentioned soft drink . think really good anecdote believe -- along bill private label still great deal share gain . rockstar brand particular category may able weather storm . fact , actually make kind partnership discounter little bit complicated . soft drink one . actually good anecdote europe lidl actually de-listed coke product middle price war order get price lower actually forced due customer reaction bring coke back . probably good term would liked shortly de-listing . possible little bit independent brand . think focus world one , know gatorade , know pretty -- pretty prominent store well . certain candy , well hold great deal brand strength 're able get non-food home care , know tide often extremely diï¬ƒcult unseat capacity , n't tide , 're going tough time selling laundry detergent . 're going eat quite bit share many , many brand , brand bargaining power needed maybe get store expand little bit , stay store . right , , -- context , retailer create winning strategy hard discount threat ? krogers , walmarts , albertsons , ahold delhaize u , ? tim thought ? yeah . 'll kind reiterate think 's worth repeating three main point talked end presentation . first creating competitive comprehensive merchandising mix . need private label compete cost quality discounter , supermarket hypermarket use extra space scale also provide value-added service product higher quality , premium level even provide service like walmart looking roll click collect lot aggressively year future . 's something discounter going hard time . differentiate , like bill said , ca n't beat game . 're going tough time competing price alone like discounter supermarket uk , wo n't work . two point focusing eï¬ƒcient model , smaller store format , shoppable make focus good lot higher turnover . jennifer bartashus bill bishop jennifer bartashus bill bishopbut also let get better area urban area , know lot growth coming day . finally creating scale oftentimes merger acquisition really improve bargain power everybody else 're working within supply chain . bill thought ? couple build . think traditional retailer need tim suggests avoid directly competing hard discounter respect , poor financial performance least uk chain , think attributable -- attributable sort self-inï¬‚icted wound term maybe losing control pricing compete simultaneously hard discounter challenge ecommerce , coming time . trick think maintain control pricing accomplishing goal 're talking . point 's raised question whether retail -- traditional retailer put together product mix , give price discounter like , love way said tim everything else non-discount customer looking . tim , pointed 's true edeka actually 's true hypermarket finland well . example people used mix , 's really another way saying keep control business model . slight build tim . wonderful guess , since already topic little bit , small format store ? saw data store kind shrinking size 're growing popularity lot chain -- larger chain operator either running smaller store experimenting . concept compete hard discount ? bill , want continue thought ? yeah , 'd happy . think small store format part , compete directly . 's little like complementary competition instead consumer use small format kind round need , go sprout produce earth fare natural organic product . dollar store drug store however going need make significant change assortment pricing able operate successfully market growing active presence hard discounter . said , convenient store probably going stay course , 're immediate consumption orientation well , thanks much . split decision relative small store kind dividing . think along line , tim ? tim barrett jennifer bartashus tim barrett bill bishop jennifer bartashus bill bishop yeah , n't really thing add . think bill covered pretty well . okay , great . retailer right trying success trying ? tim , thought ? yeah , mean , discount type experiment going , still exist , sold . n't think anything particularly notable nobody really able compete directly manner make u feel like might game one leading discounter u future . said , think seeing kind small format experiment take different tack competitive differentiation . think good example , well , big one , course walmart 's neighborhood express 's supermarket , ahold wal [ ph ] particularly innovative , growing pretty high clip area see ton walmarts . another innovative small format , think ahold delhaize 's fresh , small , -- 's boston area still , kind store focused ecommerce , focused delivery , focused trying draw dollar city-dwelling millennials want take delivery convenience kind often known . whole thing kind themed around purpose , along fresh food . taking think competition come le grocer , creating discounter maybe creating interest maybe smaller format experiment . know see something similar happening 's done hard replicate model 've described . see kroger small effort going ruler store example think survived many year no-frill hard discounter operated canada loblaws . created , 'm going say back early 80 become significant player canadian market . one looking hard discounter operated traditional retailer , might place look . wondewrful . thank . address everything else 's going , 's big theme food retail . potential hard discounter become even bigger disruptors joining online evolution , whether 's click collect delivery partnership instacart thing like ? think bill ? tim barrett jennifer bartashuswell , think admit , surprised yesterday 's announcement instacart 's pilot partnership aldi also think make huge sand . know aldi lidl fairly significant online grocery operation part world sell wine related product well , sort looking periphery amazon signaled need physical presence accelerate growth amazon go purchase whole food , think 's entirely possible see even merger move direction . publish headline yet . amazon buying save-a-lot inconceivable , two converge . ultimately , research show u almost every household want go way . online shopping opportunity definitely want low price score hard discounter . think convergence going inevitable probably faster might think . tim ? yeah . thanks bill . kind funny listening , 've talking prep webinar 've historically pretty bearish discounter getting online space outside -- maybe higher margin thing 've done elsewhere like selling wine internet . model tight eï¬ƒcient already got problem like making store nicer making sure people know . u , always thought online n't going really focus . money , n't personnel . mean whole point model , many people working store need know , creating online grocery opportunity outside typically involves investment personnel 's going raise price 's part discounter game plan .
