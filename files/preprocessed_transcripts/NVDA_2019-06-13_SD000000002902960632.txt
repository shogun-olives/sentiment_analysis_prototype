're really excited option increasing expansion overall gaming market many maybe chance realize fun . clear , view expands market , cannibalize existing market ? definitely near term , absolute expansion market . many people would like opportunity continue gaming anywhere there's large amount access gaming . fair enough . last strategy question . earnings call , jensen said nvidia accelerator company , 's accelerated computing company . 's message u ? mean ? yes . accelerator necessary , given overall end moore 's law . we're looking going expand computing eﬃciently future given slowdown moore 's law . use accelerator always option case around time . still significant percentage accelerator overall market . accelerated mean something added top general purpose overall compute . often accelerator limiting . accelerator rarely overall programming capability , rarely overall software stack order enhance type component underlying platform . think 're focused overall gpus overall future mellanox acquisition , 're thinking entire compute platform . we're thinking accelerating level platform networking level well intersects may happen q - unidentified participant - colette m. kress q - unidentified participant - colette m. kress q - unidentified participant - colette m. kresssoftware , networking , cpu . accelerated computing think thing jointly together term 're adding . okay . 's helpful . let 's go opportunity originally talking . gaming side . last quarter , gaming increased 11 % sequentially , declined 39 % year-over-year . extent 39 % decline year-over-year basis crypto versus inventory pure gaming card ? since 're -- 're -- bounce sequentially , mean 're -- inventory issue behind u ? sure . growth sequentially . believe 're back sequential growth think continue throughout year . prior year definitely inﬂuenced availability overall crypto , possibility using overall gpu card . essentially , diﬃcult comp u overcome . inventory -- excess inventory , believe , part pretty much behind u . believe 're able concentrate full stack turing available market , focus great capability ray tracing , begin . believe hope normalization overall business occurring somewhere q2 q3 . okay . excellent . gaming notebook growing . talked max-q gaming notebook . max-q ? opportunity ? yes . max-q great design worked , overall oems worldwide realized gamers wanted mobile . willing go backwards give thin light . wanted thin light wanted high performance time . worked design oems incorporating , call max-q . launched since ce probably 120 different laptop high-end gaming capability . also bringing ray tracing consumer , prosumer well enterprise capability . important leading-edge , great gaming notebook great performance would see high-end desktop well . okay . opportunity seems ray tracing . -- important ray tracing ? -- game available ? saw press release guy topic week , think . bring u speed ray tracing . yes . ray tracing , believe , essential next generation gaming . distinguished piece architecture capability allows thing look near q - unidentified participant - colette m. kress q - unidentified participantreal , longer simulating capability ray tracing physic behind actually real time . turing card starting well $ 300 price point lower absolutely use overall ray tracing . announced many new game starting back late fall . even last 1.5 week computex , e3 , probably nearly half dozen new game , including call duty , cyberpunk couple really great game coming . endorsement ecosystem , game engine , building well apis microsoft others begin entire ecosystem focused ray tracing . hardware platform focused overall ray tracing . 're really pleased ongoing excitement brought ray tracing . okay . let 's shift data center , declined 10 % year-over-year , 7 % sequentially . think every company sell data center saw great growth last year recently , decline . think company believe 's digestion period 's going data center . talk visibility like today data center ? describe order process forecasting process data center ? customer pinging ? asking lead time ? give visibility program they're going back half year ? shine little light process u ? sure . latter half 2018 , significant amount purchase , worldwide hyperscales others associated overall data center . probably would refer little bit much . saw , turned corner 2019 , saw first month january , feel lot replanning occurring across world term much purchasing term year . replanning took good portion first quarter . 've moved second quarter , still little cloudy term see data center . believe second half stronger second half return overall purchasing . confidence relies overall engagement engineering level . several ongoing engagement time across board , whether hyperscales , whether consumer internet company several enterprise think use gpus broad possible us , training inferencing , term machine learning overall data science . significant amount work leaf u overall confidence . n't case order processing po . 're going use engagement engineering proven timely term think ordering happen customer . inference market bright spot data center . sequentially . year-over-year . talked t4 product . -- - colette m. kress q - unidentified participant - colette m. kress q - unidentified participant - colette m. kressbig inferencing ? 's opportunity ? inferencing enormous opportunity worldwide . 's generally cpu industry quite time . however , 're seeing overall inferencing workload changed quite bit . much advanced , many different type algorithm transpired inferencing process . seeing inferencing edge . seeing inferencing enterprise level even think overall machine learning . working continuing establish overall gpus engineered specifically inferencing . saw release overall t4 . went google 's cloud first . getting broadly adopted becoming important part data center business . moved teen double-digit level percentage overall data center business . 're confident position continue grow go forward we're pleased overall acceptance 've seen far . last question data center side -- actually inferencing . one thing jensen said driven -- inferencing opportunity , driven advancement conversational ai . conversational ai ? see right ? yes . conversational ai great new thing . demonstrated bit couple month ago gtc . 're talking discussion computing platform , whether phone , whether pc . response back simulated speech . , understanding natural language processing , speech recognition synthesizing back voice . everything recommendation engine well ( catering ) overall answer normal conversation type look . lot started early stage release google bert . bert natural language processing model many hyperscales working adopt something similar . yes , 're early stage . yet another super important evolution ai , ai training overall neural net needed support type feature . -- -- also talked rtx server target rendering remote workstation , cloud gaming disney pixar embraced solution customer . implication rtx server ? ? q - unidentified participant - colette m. kress q - unidentified participant - colette m. kresssure . rtx server well rtx overall quadro workstation super important piece rendering happens enterprise . popular film industry overall design industry . spend hour building frame frame need many special effect see great movie . usually take overnight work sending overall data form overall render , come back , look overall work continue make tweak . able rendering real time overall capability ray trace overall gpus . gpus availability within quadro . 10 different oems built rtx server also able transform amount time . 's generally , , cpu market . there's probably 1.5 million overall cpu installed . next several year , hope refresh gpu offering allow speed entire rendering process . okay . 2 minute left want opportunity anyone ﬂoor ask question . question audience ? mellanox transaction , concentration sort 2 big supplier getting together , particularly china , obviously , given background ... case nvidia mellanox , discussed announcement deal , unique really absolutely overlap term work . provide unique piece within data center term capability . think work complementary continue provide product well product move forward . goal strategic opportunity move forward , build together long term order help improve advance overall industry . feedback 've received . last word . colette , thank much joining u today . thank .
