name ross macmillan rbc capital market . 'm delighted welcome vikas mehta , 's finance director also member investor relation team microsoft . know wanted make introductory remark . ( multiple speaker ) ? yes . first , 'd like thank phenomenal opportunity . 's privilege . 'm thrilled talk financial analyst investor . begin , wanted remind everyone may making forward-looking statement may subject risk uncertainty . please review security filing describe risk uncertainty . , begin . question answer great . one thing 's maybe le well-known vikas actually finance manager right start origination azure business oﬃce 365 business . actually wanted start business become really important microsoft story last year . let 's start azure , first . starting full program , think key kind early decision microsoft made around strategy proven important success business ? - vikas mehta - ross macmillan - vikas mehta yes . think ( inaudible ) azure oﬃce 365 cloud business phenomenal success right . fact , seeing phenomenal user adoption well increase user driving consistent triple-digit revenue growth . look back , lot success right stem back early decision took early bet made cloud . think azure , launched azure february 2010 , almost five year back . time , industry analyst competitor thought move would cannibalistic revenue . would dilutive earnings . however , firmly believed tectonic shift way , shift similar proportion saw client-server pc revolution . knew would matching scenario overall would accretive business . 'd say biggest boldest thing fully- embraced cloud . meant massive global feel theme cloud . challenging number reason , business model predominantly software license business . shifting make fundamentally users-based model . secondly , investing million dollar capital expenditure meant number new thing u . 'd say learned number important lesson , . first , 's infused whole cloud dna everything , whether engineering agility , whether robust supply chain operation . misstep along way . quickly recovered . see term lot success stem back early decision . i'd say 's easy big cloud player . might try take way . live . build infrastructure time , success come . one thing struck stepped outside normal boundary comfortable microsoft , supporting alternative operating system like linux , example ( inaudible ) oracle support oracle database microsoft environment . come realization sort open player , opposed playing microsoft set ? yes . , azure strategy evolved time . started platform , service offering azure . time expanded vision make cloud boundary limit . mean said 're going address different customer segment , whether enterprise , whether charge , whether lee enable build application across operating system , across data set , across language framework . enable used device operating system , essentially . broad- - ross macmillan - vikas mehtabased new vision steve president group . think took three major step direction . first one make easy enterprise onboard cloud , introduction infrastructure-as-a-service , well build lot hybrid capability platform . second regard cross-platform . across board said , multiple layer , whether adding linux mix addition window . fact 20 % azure run linux . added lot different database addition sql server . bring oracle database ibm db2 . even open-source database like mongo , cassandra , well hadoop . even language framework , addition .net java , open source language like php python know , extends device o , also . third , important thing , aggressive term partnership . extended way big player like oracle , sap , ibm , salesforce , player like cloudera , hortonworks , core o well docker . fix make sure give customer choice . knew enterprise run heterogeneous environment . order u one- stop-shop , provide cio . 'd say evolution . something made u successful . important -- microsoft 's time , big first-party scale , web scale application , like bing , example . think player come enterprise software heritage trying think cloud , n't necessarily first party web scale application experience . important , evolution azure , saw today ? yes , first-party application definitely big structural advantage u . think -- fundamentally way think infrastructure isolation first-party application . look back history launched window server 90 . real power came first-party application , like sql server exchange , sharepoint lync . every iteration feedback loop got better better . able create good , robust operating system . hold true azure , reinventing infrastructure modern application need . turn everyone else also need . think first-party application 200 web service microsoft . diverse honest skill make u see robust platform . - ross macmillan - vikas mehta - ross macmillan - vikas mehtalet give example . think xbox skype , million subscriber actively engaging platform . hand , asset like bing onedrive , store petabyte data . diverse set workload also mean way cpu simulation gaming , xbox live , productivity oﬃce 365 applied machine learning bing . able in-house learn first-party application given u phenomenal learning ground better attack platform . use virtual cycle take learning third party bring eﬃciency application . . , competitor public cloud infrastructure n't necessarily legacy on-premise software . way , microsoft 's bit unique position . use first-party web scale application service . 've got legacy base sort -- n't know , legacy , guess encompasses application . make microsoft unique today sort strategy way sell cio/cco value prop ? absolutely . know , think strategy , three key pillar . first one hyper scale infrastructure , second hybrid strength . third enterprise-grade service . , think traditional player , typically invested data center scale done . 19 region across world , even bigger amazon google provide . player hyper scale also provide consistency across on-premise cloud . fact , hybrid perspective , workload window server , easily move service provider cloud public cloud . essentially give good portability . finally , aspect enterprise-grade service , think internet scale provider like google amazon , actually hyper scale sure . come providing hybrid enterprise-grade service , rich deep expertise around area . feel pretty good competitive position . back started , made decision go cloud , felt would cannibalistic . lot would additive . think 've seen last year , year-and-a-half , look way report commercial license growing still . commercial cloud business growing obviously rapidly . important piece commercial license business still growing . sustainable ? mean , guess that's question get lot , point actually cannibalize ? 's -- ? - ross macmillan - vikas mehtano . think 's good question . 'd say kept historical tectonic shift happened whether said , client-server pc revolution virtualization , lot consolidation happened lot shift destruction happened . key point drove lot productivity . came increased spend . think spend percentage gdp different revolution , gone . see feel theme , cloud disruption , feel maximal scenario cloud creates , possible earlier world , would help cloud accretive rather cannibalistic overall business . see scenario example , machine learning , big data , analytics , etcetera . fact , u feel creates three time opportunity overall spend share perspective versus played prior world . important aspect shift enterprise , private cloud public cloud , n't happen switch . go situation first get hybrid deployment , learn . checked cloud reliability , availability feature . make switch . 's seeing right , make switch revenue customer getting bigger bigger . essentially enterprise spending stack on-premise side well cloud side . long term , feel cloud creates newer opportunity u feel really good position right . financial characteristic , guess margin specifically ? simplistically think way think , provisioning basic element infrastructure like use storage , fairly monetized business , least pricing dynamic suggest , seem ratchet rapidly . whereas , move scale advanced application area , perhaps margin structure little better . could help u frame think transition may may impact margin . maybe 's margin question much profit contribution ? yes , think 's probably right way look , gross margin dollar shift cloud . let give framework think . think three key pillar , first one core infrastructure capability , essentially drive adoption platform . second regard hybrid . giving enterprise way on-ramp cloud . third higher-level service essentially differentiate . - ross macmillan q - unidentified participant - ross macmillan - vikas mehtaso think core infrastructure capability . providing core infrastructure capability actually help bootstrap lot high level service . 'd discount core infrastructure capability , actually important especially land expand kind motion . see lot storage , example , sort provider choice storage , see newer scenario higher level service use top . example , big data analytics , machine learning , even tiered storage , tiered cloud storage store simple appliance . see lot up-sell different area . second important aspect 'd like point , sometimes computing storage categorized commodity -- . differentiate pillar , also . premium storage offering well premium compute offering high performance compute well source simple storage appliance , differentiated help u monetize batch level . hybrid spend extremely important , second point , provide differentiation easier on-ramp , charge premium consistency common tool provide . finally , higher level service absolutely go stack , whether application whether differentiated provide infrastructure capability . give edge others . service like medium service , machine learning , mobility service , premium service . overall 'd say mix really critical . time core infrastructure capability drive adoption also extremely important . 'll quickly end saying healthy mixture 60 % customer using higher level service . want open question . question audience , happy take . one ? ( inaudible ) let repeat question , question 's level investment support growth cloud business , given , 's growth . yes , think 's great question , go back first question term challenge face shifted business model . 's capital-intensive business . spending billion dollar raise , build data center . - ross macmillan q - unidentified participant - vikas mehta - ross macmillan q - unidentified participant - ross macmillanand even expand capacity number . reason , reason 's differentiator u company . one , strong balance sheet . second , first-party application , mentioning earlier , help u drive initial utilization tier . third-party adoption scale . definitely capital-intensive business . three player see long-term able sustain level investment -- u , google . amazon . said , feel really good hybrid plan well hyper scale ability invest main infrastructure . 'll get one back first ? ( inaudible ) yes , think 's great question . say objective create unique , complete , comprehensive cloud offering cater essentially different scenario well different customer segment . cross-platform big initiative u . seen great adoption across board . healthy diverse set workload . example , 20 % azure linux . staggering , considering predominantly window server- based operating system , even started azure . secondly , 'd say customer segmenting perspective , quite diverse mix 40 % revenue come start-ups isvs . 's enterprise agreement driving . pretty healthy mix . course , enterprise definitely area strength mentioned . vantage point . definitely securing . fact , 57 % fortune 500 us azure . know , invests azure . feel pretty good overall spend platform . yes ? ( inaudible ) question , recently 've seen spend ( inaudible ) well positioned microsoft capture aggregate budget ? - vikas mehta - ross macmillan q - unidentified participant - ross macmillan - vikas mehta . think look holistic perspective time , see mobile-first , cloud-first vision really disrupts creates lot opportunity . think newer scenario even something could imagine prior ( inaudible ) , see thing way example , farming company know , company . people involved farming , use internet thing , cloud technology understand trend need invest term future agriculture investment cycle . way industry like hospitality banking , scenario possible earlier . definitely feel new scenario going expand tam . think area interest , big data catching really fast , internet thing definitely growing . see result also , growing on-premise side well cloud . second level 's really important growing fast versus competitor . 'd say still feel trend really healthy . inherent strength grow on-premise start cloud . overall long term , cloud big opportunity area u . back ? ( inaudible ) repeat question . , window annuity business big become time . yes . well 's good question . 'd say look overall annuity mix enterprise business , kept growing time . people shifting transactional annuity . roadmap . stronger roadmap , quicker iteration make term pace innovation . comfortable customer term betting long-term . 's seen across board . , going back question , specifically window , big business u , last said . 's $ 4 billion business u . rightly pointed growing double digit . 'd say -- , investment long- term roadmap , come quick iteration keep raising - ross macmillan q - unidentified participant - vikas mehta - ross macmillan - vikas mehta - ross macmillanthe bar term enterprise feature , customer feel comfortable investing . point , 'd say window 10 focus heavily enterprise feature . catering lot important scenario enterprise . feel pretty good volume licensing business window side . right ? ( inaudible ) yes , yes . think go back earlier point made regard hyper scale infrastructure . time able differentiate . give u unique balance lot company n't . think amazon , specifically , even google matter , good first-party application ability create hyper scale infrastructure . time pas benefit back customer price , etcetera . unique position first-party application diverse scale . hence also ability . difference , hybrid strength well different theatre term long heritage enterprise-grade service . give example , example , even think gartner magic quadrant , leadership said credited four category , infrastructure service , platform service , x86 virtualization cloud storage . amazon two . google believe none . hyper scale critical , important . able differentiate provide comprehensive cloud platform -- know , unique u . well-positioned perspective . 've run time . thank much , vikas . great . great time . thanks lot , ross . thanks .
