're building porfolio solution enterprise consumer working lot telecommunication carrier integrate network . sort frontier technology , like artificial intelligence , machine learning specifically guy tensor ﬂow . role playing enterprise decision ? lot customer talking u using machine learning platform also increasingly using solution . one limitation today enterprise adopting ai ml lack skill . taking technical expertise ai ml converting solution customer use q - heath terry - thomas kurian q - heath terryhelps u speed adoption , help u appeal different buyer , help u get door may prior , 's opening addressable market . practical example , e-commerce happened demand forecasting extremely diﬃcult customer order online want delivered home . order online want delivered store pickup . position inventory ? put distribution center , put store 's complex problem . expertise ai ml help many retailer problem . 're saying 's set tool , n't bring army data scientist access . 're actually helping solution 's approach 's helping u differentiate player market . look cloud environment , think lot investor still think cloud primarily compute storage . guy obviously lot success moving stack application level layer . level satisfaction google workspace adoption business market . would really interested thought sort enterprise collaboration market tool , chat , workﬂow move stack . seen cloud used thought cheap compute storage network sort replace data center utility computing . 's certainly market segment , increasingly variety thing people want top analytic tool , data warehousing , security tool , collaboration tool . look google workspace example , seen continued growth , double-digit growth user , double-digit growth average revenue per user satisfaction measure independent survey product high . see increasingly startup , small medium business large enterprise adopting . part -- written cloud-native . pandemic hit people needed say overnight , need send employee home need collaborate thing guarantee browser mobile phone , much easier . lastly , 's entire collection people -- take nurse , example ascension health , nurse writing document filling spreadsheet slide presentation . collaborating . digital device collection people come , buying decision optimizing different traditional white-collar worker optimizing . see lot momentum product . frankly rebranded brought new capability , far 've seen strong growth product . know 's fair ask predict future . asked last year , probably would said biggest story cloud would business - thomas kurian q - heath terry - thomas kuriancontinuity remote work . sit right , sit right , see biggest story cloud year ahead ? n't pandemic , 'll frank . heath , n't predict . think [ ph ] trend see following . think many ceo recognized digitization , even though accelerated pandemic fundamental . expect continue beyond pandemic . expect see greater differentiation kind solution people adopted . continue see organization making important business decision technology platform need , software programing become centerpiece . go digital , every industry need talent software , engineering , programming . they've increasingly choosing platform make easy get access .
