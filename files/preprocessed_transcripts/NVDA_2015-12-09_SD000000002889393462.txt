's lot going . maybe starting pc market , gaming , talked growth rate broke gaming versus oem analyst day , 've updated several quarter since . good picture growth rate . talk really driving ? talk right long-term growth rate ? colette kress blayne curtis colette kressand 's interesting computex go ptams struggling , half business gaming laptop well . big laptop part overall gaming pie today think people would traditionally think graphic card maybe hard-core gamers , developed last couple year ? yes . let break , think overall gaming result gaming market adding card market see today people necessarily purchasing end-to-end pc take part overall gaming . pc . updating experience gaming producing better gpu game want play . 's fueling good percentage overall growth . highlighted key interesting piece also notebook . gamers want game everywhere . want pc take friend mobile space need solid gpu experience . oem manufacturer working u also model truly gaming marketed gaming population . growing quite well . several quarter past nearly doubling size business still coming small base . see focus much interest regarding notebook . got way go keep overall size adding card market term data center . excuse gamers . piece , type device gaming going 're going make sure 're focused . whether tablet . key device well , well streaming part cloud going see term overall gaming result . look discrete card market driving customer buy next generation powerful , talk whether 's moving term directx upgrade physic processor , 's lot going term gaming look like movie almost term production value . 's right way think cadence upgrade changed ? think surrounded overall industry we've surrounded see full ecosystem around gaming platform blayne curtis colette kresscontinued evolve . production value game , work continuous software developer game make realistic . gamer receives go purchase add-in card experience come life minute plug , minute open back computer start overall game . continue relationship underlying gamer , providing new driver , new upgrade new game coming . also good understanding type game inﬂuence . improve experience exact game better gpu . set call gameworks key design focused harder part graphic whether fire , hair , smoke , water , key thing see high-end game really come life work done exclusively game developer put place . thing inﬂuence gamers continue come back platform allow u continue leadership share overall gaming market . rate upgrade , 's little hard determine . sure absolutely enthusiast type gamers coming back every single time put new architecture new platform . 's still little bit early see fast movement term refresh cycle . tremendous success current architecture . want ask , 's necessarily application broader gaming vr almost add-on gaming experience feel 've going ce three four year much look , maybe drone vr actually going something else focus . still early day . 'm curious thought play getting gaming base upgrade capability ? yes . 's good question . think next exciting evolution pc gaming absolutely virtual reality . 're forefront term new game , new device enable vr experience . virtual reality becoming experience based underlying technology great experience . really solving really hard problem latency order put encapsulated position great experience key . blayne curtis colette kress blayne curtisnow many different type form vr 'll probably see coming 2016. key one 're concentrated would needing set glass , high-end pc . high-end pc enables keyframe rate necessary great overall position . work oculus well also htc , recommendation they're coming regarding type pc would best enable hardware coming probably one top three gpus currently sell overall retail value price . great opportunity u . probably assured already started movement getting excitement upcoming release 2016. great opportunity u upsell refresh . 's obviously hard forecast big market could trajectory i'm going put spot . term requirement generation obviously 're going future generation probably even ante . term installed base today , going buy oculus rift much installed base could actually even support today obviously rough term ? yes , think upgrading installed base key part focus . strong growth rate today still way go term upgrading installed base something see . 're correct . ca n't make prediction next year many unit , kind upgrade 'll see . think 's early tell term supply available . beginning think continuous content vr improving vr experience go forward . even capability moving beyond gaming see many use case prototyping different scenario enterprise well . look forward 's still little bit early tell term big get . want change gear , obviously lot talk . auto probably easier handicap know win , know big platform could , maybe timing could move around . today bulk revenue console dash application . obviously interest autonomous application . talk think ramp colette kress blayne curtis colette kressof win talk maybe competitively see opportunity gain share ? sure . currently business automotive right $ 80 million quarter . also risen 80 % growth last year average . 'll continue see growth platform . 8 million car road today infotainment system backed nvidia . probably pipeline 25 million car need hit road . 's safe say yes , see growth . exactly quarter quarter 's perfect crystal ball term . yes , strong growth automotive business count . think work term autonomous driving platform seeded platform 50 different oem manufacturer , researcher startup around world . interest quite high platform central compute autonomous driving . hear u talk automotive ce outside virtual reality . 'll also great presentation talk next step term automotive term . seeded development platform continue work probably see next development service individual provider . look console business , in-dash business , tesla put big screen lot people chased . look performance requirement 're talking driving digital dash seems go car seems make sense 's . talk 8 million going 25 million , based business say 8 million quarter still see suﬃcient growth longer horizon start layer autonomous driving ? yes , think continue evolve . position really best end graphic necessary digital cluster go forward . frankfurt international car show next piece essentially virtual dashboard . button , nothing . key company demonstrating see future concept car . 'll continue stay high-end part overall graphic . 're able benefit right think additional car blayne curtis colette kress blayne curtis colette kressdesign win landing really luxury line really high-end car , able take platform move many mainstream . 're benefiting , maybe even keeping competition know key selling point overall technology within car digital display well received . see u go model expands well probably next gen infotainment system going forward . -- xonex stage 's many semi company pursuing ada driver assisted , 's one real growing area semi many . solution would programmable term gpu base versus maybe pld even assp , maybe could see mobileye 's fixed algorithm . could talk . 's also different type . google plus driving car may major oem deploys . still lot moving piece term -- 's correct . self driving , assisted driving . think dan talked one platform turn 45 mile hour . 's obviously illegal notification well . gpu fit ? going early stage move volume think maybe move fixed solution see oems actually dynamically changing learning would benefit ? yes , think 's correct assume 's lot different semiconductor company inside car . 's probably 50 different microprocessor , whether single function , two function type service thing going lot focus ada . focus center compute different type need technology assist ada really talking underlying supercomputer inside car , necessarily focused single function focused eliminating . also going necessary car . blayne curtis colette kress blayne curtisour strategy really providing underlying platform thing coexist remove driver replace driver ? supercomputer would key point . think 's different angle many peer seen approach really focused overall platform . want ask , talked growth business . mentioned data center workstation business also directed . obviously muted year everybody year . talk maybe business ﬂat respectively ? look next year type visibility returning parity ? yes , enterprise business focused pro visualization . recall first part calendar year quite bit volatility term macro condition particularly around fx rate . inﬂuenced term lot channel , overall thought term pricing worldwide saw many different change term would purchase overall capital needed refresh expand . take growth overall business saw first part year . 've seen lot stabilization fx rate , necessarily change stabilization produce little bit better result thought q3 well . 'll stay focused still question term get back term growth . ca n't make prediction right going forward next year generally look one quarter . 's see 's ﬂattish little bit 'll stay focused . data center business , strong pipeline lot key area seen . result year ago early year inﬂuenced large project . large project . 's next new large project next year . get little bit lumpy term look . confident data center business continue add term strong growth go forward . large project probably produced little bit lumpiness right . colette kress blayne curtis colette kress blayne curtisi want ask gross margin look next year lot moving piece well . pc oem drag 's small . gaming growing deliver good gross margin . talk moving piece ? maybe auto , volume could mean lower margin think 're adding lot value , time could accretive well . talk moving piece ? yes . talked four market . refer four growth market strategic market go forward . far year date fiscal year 2016 overall revenue growth approximately 5 % far . look growth market growing 25 % far year date , even though overall company growing 5 % . still piece pc oem business tegra oem business . become commodity- based necessarily grow-ish aspect n't seen particularly growing . correct become relatively small part business last quarter represented le 10 % business . 'll continue watch . 'll continue compete business right economics pc oem . see u concentrate four key market think tremendous tam opportunity front u also great leadership position four different one . ca n't make prediction term next year . really look one quarter . great tam , exciting market . whether artificial intelligence , virtual reality , autonomous driving many three key disruptive market see talked . underlying platform 's able enable three . last question . 're asking everybody actually see disruptive trend think answered . look next year actually involved many disruptive trend . 's correct . q - unidentified participant - colette kress q - blayne curtis - colette kress q - unidentified participant - colette kress q - blayne curtisi want leave little time question audience . 's couple minute anybody . question answer think accelerated headset accelerated gpu addition pc gaming console whatever device would ? okay , n't hear first part . would put gpu headset physically ? know , 's still early term solve vr , overall performance better actually glass . right near future see glass overall pc probably key focus 'm sure 'll continue improve overall technology vr becomes desire gamers . wanted ask like two supercomputer car , take supercomputer get stronger time year . personally feel need one one time . two powerful chip car ? okay . think referencing platform put together drive px actually enables two overall socs incorporated right . question two enough actually get need even . given functionality need occur , parallel processing dual support within car need possible fail capability performance actually may get stronger . one , two , could multiple term underlying computer generates self driving car . removing human car pretty big task amount compute capability human year year driving . think look 's hard amount thing replicate . necessarily replicated one simple little microprocessor , 's significant supercomputer 's probably necessary . - colette kressthe clock say zero . appreciate time , colette . great , thank .
