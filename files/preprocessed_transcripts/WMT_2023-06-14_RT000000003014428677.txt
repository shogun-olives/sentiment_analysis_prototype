're making tremendous investment supply chain . 've got opportunity see . mentioned . unit economics around fulfillment improve roughly 20 % . 20 % lower , rather , say , five year , complete . next five year three year , think , 're going roughly 65 % store served automation . , provides better experience , integrity experience customer , also lower unit cost . , 's expanding gm , 's business grow faster , improving unit economics service provide today . , thinking unit economics standpoint three , four , five year , thinking supply chain cost coming 20 % 5 % sale , could 100 bps margin ? include store cost well maybe even 100 bps opportunity ? framing right ? opportunity excess 100 bps , 're thinking absolutely right way . applies fcs dc , also store . focus lot supply chain technology , 're implementing technology like visbic system back electronic shelf label . , electronic shelf label save ton hour store course period , like quarter , 're needing go change manually . , automation really give u opportunity operate much eﬃciently allow associate best , 's serve customer . greg , maybe finalize point associate , expectation population associate would remain relatively ﬂat next several year . , n't expect see drawdown number people , 's redeploying individual person different job upskilling good majority workforce place 're serving customer close proximity customer thing within automation sequence , 're serving contributing overall technology . , real good opportunity associate well expecting major change overall headcount . q - greg melich - john david rainey q - greg melich - john david rainey q - greg melich hold -- go ahead . 'm sorry , greg . guess would say trend , next question going basically , , 've invested lot labor last year . think wage probably low double digit year ago probably mid-singles year . moderate back something normal , way really get productivity labor , 'm -- ? 's true . restate steph said slightly differently , believe grow . labor , feel comfortable today , whether 's average wage starting wage . wage associate increased tremendously whether look three-year period five-year period . , definitely want continue pay associate appropriately , average hourly wage . 's -- view career , like take stat like promotion , 88 % promotion position , say filled store start entry-level filled people walmart associate . , 're going hiring someone street necessarily . 're giving someone opportunity advance . 's -- think 's really important , people think wealth creation career growth walmart . want go back point mentioned around margin , said investor day , expect next several year average sale grow 4 % . year may , year may le , average 4 % . said operating income grow faster . clearly , like 'm talking like 5 % . 5 % , 'll disappointed . showed range outcome , think , kind cleverly shaded graph , upwards almost 8 % . , think 's tremendous opportunity execute initiative control dramatically change margin profile company . really translates increased free cash ﬂow , better profit , get capital allocation , 's big opportunity walmart going forward . 's great way tie together . -- want make sure n't leave , business mix part talked beginning . - john david rainey q - greg melich - john david rainey q - greg melich - john david raineyreasonable goal thing like medium business ? look percentage sale -- digital sale ? even frame opportunity ? way look internally , think external metric around well , looking percent gmv , call roughly sale today . look competitor maybe best-in-class , approach 10 % people . 's also dependent , greg , upon type item 're selling . , 'll see advertising relates gm food . going , 's easier attract advertising dollar pair sneaker head broccoli . , take 9 % 10 % , kind high watermark industry people like u , normalize mix business , actually translates call roughly 6 using little bit crude math , roughly 6 % , 7 % gmv . , 's aspiration u . , would put u top 10 probably advertiser u.s. next five year . , 's big opportunity . opportunity beyond product sale vendor might already working ? maybe , 'm thinking example like would marriott hotel want advertise knowing somebody looking luggage ? yes , absolutely . -- think 's insignificant opportunity . think importantly , want make sure advertise way provides better experience customer . n't want over-rotate try monetize advertising dollar throw bunch stuff offer front customer n't relevant . , 're always going keep focus eye mission , helping customer , save money live better . , 're going probably little -- use little discretion certain area around advertising . example , 's relevant customer , believe 's something want -- would want , would absolutely consider something like . got . , n't want go crazy , whether 's slippery slope , targeted , make sense . exactly . q - greg melich - john david rainey q - greg melich - john david rainey great . , maybe last minute , got get -- margin , want make sure get return balance sheet cash ﬂow good stuff . , capex going . think guy mentioned maybe close $ 20 billion , matter framed . get roi inﬂection ? yes . , let start way view capital allocation every dollar compete alternative . right , believe single best investment investing capex , high roi around . 've stated despite elevated level capex , believe roi go every year . , 's good governor guardrail make sure 're telling investment community , promise wait , 're going spend money come several year later . want demonstrate invest business , seeing return investment go year . 'll go little bit year . 's going go little bit year , year based upon trajectory investment 're making . said , believe 's important balanced capital allocation includes returning cash shareholder form share repurchase dividend . 're going aggressive , 's appropriate . think stock undervalued , 'll see u opportunistic . believe always appropriate return cash shareholder share repurchase . look multi-year plan , five-year plan economics around , drive share gain much greater see today . , 're investing long term . 're thinking way investor would . also would aspire continue increase dividend . dividend aristocrat . 've increasing dividend number year . point future , 'd able maybe hope step change , increase even perhaps higher payout ratio today . think 's important demonstrate , come increasing margin , increasing free cash ﬂow . -- talk payout ratio , percentage prior year earnings would think ? q - greg melich - john david rainey q - greg melich - john david raineyprior year earnings , look historically , go back , 8 10 year , that's vacillated range call mid-30s mid-40s . 's probably 's appropriate business period time . n't really targeted payout ratio policy , say . something targeted internally , n't policy around . opportunity u future . want change -- send little different message street around 're thinking dividend . maybe last part question , 's optimal leverage ratio ? mean obviously lot change rate , lot real estate , fortress balance sheet , number debt-to-ebitda target , yes ? yes . generally target 2x leverage ratio , aa credit rating provides u ﬂexibility , whether respect using capital , also considering thing like commercial paper . think importantly u , like , tremendous amount opportunity , think capital allocation . 're always going looking lens creates value shareholder . look leverage ratio today map graph like , get lowest weighted average cost capital , would suggest could lower marginally , lose ﬂexibility . , really like roughly 2x leverage ratio aa credit rating . make lot sense . think time come close . , john david , want appreciate time . got lot 35 minute . kary steph , i'll annoying figure remodeled store tour summit next year . thank joining u great rest summer . okay . thank , greg . appreciate . bye .
