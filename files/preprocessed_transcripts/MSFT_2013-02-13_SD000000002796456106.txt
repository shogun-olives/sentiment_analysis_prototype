right , think ready get started . good morning , everybody , day two global tech conference . thrilled peter klein cfo microsoft u morning . format , peter going go series question , going open see question want throw start . good morning . thank coming . thanks . great . right , tablet . shoutout see handful people surface . awesome . peter klein heather bellini peter kleinpeter , thank . trend seem though moving smaller size form factor , right ? lot interest thing like mini , 7-inch fire , nexus 7. talk u microsoft need , anything , kind capitalize 7-inch trend ? yes , yes , great . really set . notion ﬂexibility scalability operating system actually intrinsic vision strategy . talk lot device service say device service , mean set experience complete , compelling consistent across whole range form factor device , including size form factor . see thing done window phone 8 window 8. clearly , share kernel core code base driving form factor 4 inch way 27 inch all-in-one everything . think developer platform , done lot hard work application scale depending size form factor . core vision delivering set service across form factor scalability operating system . think really well set deliver sort versatile set experience across form factor whether 4 inch , 5 inch , 7 inch , 8 inch , 10 inch , 13 inch . along partner ecosystem , work based underlying demand . one strength ecosystem always versatility ﬂexibility variety form factor variety price point . sort set kind dynamic , talked past , trend towards new kind form factor device experience beginning continuing ultimate sort form factor uncertain . well set respond demand see . new window pc seen market lot know coming met tammy week ago . look tablet form factor coming market , guy think change course consumer pc landscape ? consumer pc overall compute , kind see thing different growth rate ? yes . well certainly encouraged . talked , early launch window 8 fundamental reimagining experience work play impact consumer experience lot . heather bellini peter klein heather bellini peter kleinencouraged work going speak . talked almost doubled number certified system lot great work going across ecosystem . hopefully people get see come market . kind shown throughout ecosystem . acer , hp , dell , lenovo , bringing great 10 inch , 13 inch touch laptop market . think see going forward price point . start see maybe lower priced , $ 599 , tablet , ultrabooks , touch ultrabooks coming market clover trail architecture . think time encouraged ecosystem delivering . clear thing need continue bring compelling device , touch experience , touch first experience right price point think well , positive impact see consumer pc market . remains seen . vertical integration -- mean hardware xbox . think microsoft kind three five year road based comment made different form factor , microsoft going become vertically integrated time ? well hard speculate going forward . certainly thing obviously surface give u opportunity thing tablet market think benefit whole ecosystem learned lot done surface bring back learning rest ecosystem . think fair say always look make sense vertical integration perspective , well ecosystem perspective . obviously xbox made ton sense successful . think surface obviously give great learning great example window 8 obviously focused ecosystem well . question ecosystem performs microsoft , maybe notion vertical integration n't going important going forward kind feel like 're always going skin game whether tablet side phone side ? yes , think always balance always thing like surface think good ecosystem , good customer benefit heather bellini peter klein heather bellini peter kleinthe whole ecosystem . always strong ecosystem play well . school thought would say consumer n't want multi-home , meaning want tablet smartphones part operating platform benefit might get sharing content across multiple device say web-based apps . wondering -- microsoft feel . yes . well agree . actually would even take step . broader tablet smartphones . think device phone , tablet , pc living room well . probably broader content operating system platform . experience think complete set experience people want , sort trying deliver sort similar developer platform . getting closer closer every day developer platform people develop run anywhere sort form factor everything deliver . think service deliver , whether xbox live skydrive storing content , smartglass take entertainment game tv phone happen leaving . agree ecosystem play set consistent experience , content . overall experience whether work play across device . core sort vision . think think -- obviously dominant share pc today , great share living room xbox , phone tablet . know line blurring type device . people would say really coming behind two area . microsoft -- watch , kind microsoft hoping make -- try see dynamic change view people n't want multi-home , need kind -- need see share increase area kind come device factor . . think right obviously focused . part ecosystem , come point strength think living room sort pc laptop want sort take advantage . point , people look obviously focused delivering set compelling experience across form factor pleased progress made phone window phone 8. starting see traction last holiday season . focused . obviously window 8 early heather bellini peter klein heather bellini peter kleinon , focused delivering touch touch laptop tablet experience really compelling key area look success . get asked lot alternative microsoft n't start see share change thing like phone thing like tablet . walk u kind different alternative think alternative might think investor ? yes . hard say sure alternative . mean obviously -- early sort new generation got bold project sort thought ecosystem , thought window 8 think sort operating system driving change . u , focused continuing success pc , taking tablet phone window phone 8 window 8 continuing place great success like xbox delivering continuing deliver great entertainment experience . get asked lot term alternative could microsoft make cheaper . mean getting vertically integrated aggressive price point kind making money lifetime value customer , might think way going forward cutting price oems , sure material enough make big difference term end price would . think people trying think -- , look consumer compute share , share kind leveled . go back benefit ( inaudible ) effect talking . could -- like plan b ? yes . great question . would say le plan b execute current plan . big believer price differentiation customer segmentation think right . think different price point different use case different set customer . aim continue evolve generation window make sure right set experience right price point sort customer segment . think -- probably nuance lower price raise price . right set experience right price point given scenario customer segment . think -- le plan b tweak plan , bring new thing market make sure right offering right price point . heather bellini peter klein heather bellini peter klein heather bellini peter klein heather bellini area get lot focus end life xp april next year guess happen . think -- guy mentioned little 50 % people -- 60 % . 60 % window 7. think tail left call 12 month ? yes , would expect lot tail continue migrate window 7 end life xp . interesting question going impact business pc market . many upgrade current hardware , much happen new hardware . hard predict . think mix . seeing date lot upgrade happening existing hardware , good enterprise business . different seen past ? probably little bit , probably little bit . enterprise starting get interested window 8. typically launch new operating system , particularly one degree change window 8 , consumer sort adopt first enterprise take look . interesting thing seeing starting new enterprise application people building . interesting see play . talked , volume licensing ea business window strong last quarter . think lot sort upgrade cycle window 7 existing hardware think time 'll start see people buying new hardware upgrade well . would think pc replacement rate right ? saying would imply actually lengthening even seen peter klein heather bellini peter klein heather bellini peter kleinam mistaking comment ? yes , would say sort intrinsically lengthening . point time , might see people taking advantage upgrading window 7 existing hardware time upgrade new hardware . n't want sort imply new trend . 's think point time scenario . also come said going get frequent window update sound like maybe going every 12 month . really start see ela business window , deferred portion would imagine start bigger driver business going forward maybe make untethered pc shipment known past . yes . could . mean ca n't sort predict exactly happen . think viable expectation . okay . feedback enterprise customer thus far , like window 8 ? , think , like said , adoption going consumer side first . initial thought , even one maybe gotten hand pro kind ( inaudible ) . yes . 's early . 's high degree interest . people interested experience compelling user . comforting security manageability perspective . think lot great conversation . got great early example use case enterprise adopting window 8. think early , seeing certain type workforce , lot mobile workforce , field workforce telecom company like british telecom using field workforce , emirate airline using crew deliver application in- ﬂight experience . starting see people experiment usage scenario type worker , well new application . people getting performance benefit . said lot , one thing noticed right away started using window 8 , simply -- even without new innovation -- better window 7 , ( inaudible ) , fast , heather bellini peter klein heather bellini peter klein heather bellini peter klein heather belliniﬂuid . think seeing enterprise starting experience . early think play time . anything said thus far developing lot apps get developed internally think app development touch , developer talked experience thus far ? yes . i corporate developer pretty excited building new class apps touch-based natively also take -- benefit cloud well sort new paradigm . think see lot excitement corporate developer build new lob apps . think lot existing legacy sort replatformed touch . new development people really thinking touch . helped -- , knowing still early day . window phone 8 , noticed thing like pro example window 8 sku able drag window phone 8 conversation corporate customer , especially trying decide blackberry ( multiple speaker ) ? yes , say personally anecdotally n't sort broad swath data across company . certainly conversation customer increasing part dialogue absolutely . -- think microsoft 's strength kind try convert customer versus say iphone android device ? yes , think two thing . think front end back end . think sort set application experience get productivity collaboration communication way sort well-understood manageability security think compelling story enterprise tends -- two thing tend driver conversation . peter klein heather bellini peter klein heather bellini peter kleini think another thing people wondering lately , without naming name specifically . strategy help support pc ecosystem broadly based . walk u kind thing make decide might support partner need ? yes , think long history participating supporting ecosystem take different form . oftentimes , take form co-marketing , sometimes helping development ecosystem think sort dynamic industry , think ability support ecosystem , particularly ecosystem innovating device platform , good thing something continue . without upsetting people ? always balance . going long time . broadly supportive window ecosystem broad base open sort whole ecosystem . think everybody understands . rt , say surface rt , lesson learned ? market month . kind would name -- like kind list u kind top two three thing learned -- thing could work thing happy launch initial feedback . think surface rt , couple thing really learned part stem approach . know , controlled launch part reason could really observe sort understand experience launching new product , new operating system , new architecture , device . limited store online limited geography . one thing learned people really need touch see play really understand . lot build awareness . observing people coming store seeing playing super important done broaden reach distribution , get geography , third-party retail people actually come , touch play really get full experience really understand . going take heather bellini peter klein heather bellini q - unidentified participantnow broaden course , recent introduction pro , start little bit expanded distribution continue expand capacity . think thing learned rt new type operating system new architecture seeing people use taking learning actually continuing update make update operating system , part design principle begin benefit benefit whole ecosystem . learning surface helped -- see software hardware integrated closely , help u really understand core experience . build back operating system time benefit whole ecosystem well . learned lot distribution , learned lot need people experience . learned lot continually make operating system better . expect retail strategy -- mean good number , huge number retail store , microsoft retail store . think retail footprint going forward important ? important great place people , particularly reimagine experience , great place people get good exposure device , experience whole ecosystem . think expect u continue roll similar past . little bit year new window 8 new device continue path much like . measured , executed well . continue expand exposure people get device service . okay . going pause second see -- question right going switch gear little bit . two question , three . question answer heather , peter . good morning . aj ( inaudible ) , cornerstone capital management . admit , listening presentation listening story time , still clear hardware strategy . core remember microsoft seeing application microsoft live year year ago , even lap phone 3g phone early , lot great software - peter klein q - heather bellini - peter klein q - heather belliniproperties , lot opportunity expand software property grow base outside window . hardware strategy seems disintermediate current vendor really sure strategy hardware microsoft . bit detail , please . sure . say hardware , assume talking tablet pc side gaming side . think additive anything else . technology evolves innovation happens , ability work closely boundary software hardware allows u innovate way could n't said , innovation benefit whole ecosystem ability deliver unique experience hardware think interesting . show full power certain scenario window 8 . also benefit whole ecosystem . understand balancing act fact , ecosystem always balance . amazing work going across whole ecosystem think benefiting lot thing think bring window 8 market kind experience see . think time -- remember , early window 8. think time , start impressed emerging broadly ecosystem across form factor size . market evolved , gotten diverse . set experience changed think whole ecosystem evolving think play part hardware strategy allows u build nice little business . importantly , benefit whole ecosystem . bringing mic , know question , going ask one waiting mic get . lot question oﬃce io . get , reason would n't bring ultimately think would maximize profit division ? well sure imagine sort trade-off , think lot . mean history cross-platform delivery broadly productivity whether oﬃce mac whether certain experience apply customer really want cross-platform whether e-mail , communication , notetaking . deliver product cross-platform , exchange , activesync , sharepoint , onenote . whole bunch thing . importantly , web application , access oﬃce document , light editing device browser . think lot thing sort meet need continue think thing going forward . - peter klein q - heather bellini q - unidentified participant q - heather bellini - peter klein q - heather bellini - peter klein q - unidentified participantare thing waiting see make decision ?
