hey , great . good afternoon , everyone . thank much joining u . expected , standing room . name toshiya hari . cover semiconductor space goldman sachs . pleased honored manuvir da , vp enterprise computing . manuvir , lead team working democratize ai bringing full-stack accelerated computing every enterprise customer . 25 year experience technology industry prior joining nvidia 2019 , held range senior role dell microsoft . microsoft . believe helped create azure platform , thank much coming . yeah . thank , toshiya . 's honor thank everybody taking time . 'm small cog wheel , happy represent nvidia . question answer 's awesome . , manuvir , joining nvidia 2019 , , successful career microsoft dell . initially attracted nvidia ? experience company played far relative original expectation ? think , know answer question , 'll ask anyway . head enterprise computing , spend time ? key priority ? q - toshiya hari - manuvir dasyeah , 's three great question . let one-by-one . think reason joined nvidia , toshiya , grew microsoft , ultimate software platform company . understood platform good application developed . big focus developer . fact , whole thing called developer division focused developer . first conversation jensen ceo chip company would talk developer . really n't get . watched keynote gtc conference previous year . ceo spending three hour talking use-case use-case accelerated computing developer embrace build application , right ? eye opening thing guess realized time , company vision 's new form computing coming , accelerated computing , 's free thing . n't take application move accelerated computing . work one domain time mean need developer embrace , right ? 's journey company really 25 year already . could see , cusp million developer using nvidia platform , number reached 4 million , right ? 's remarkable . 's reason came nvidia realized people really seeing world cusp something , 's chip . 's whole stack . second question , would say , 've experienced differently since got , nvidia gone lot nvidia realized time , new technology , right , groundbreaking people adopt way 're familiar adopting 's whole ecosystem enterprise adopt technology whether 's hardware manufacturer like dell hpe software platform like vmware sap service integrator like deloitte accenture . 've spent lot time last year nvidia really getting ﬂywheel going . 's got point . think 's 's little different . . think third question ? key goal , priority . prioritize ..... yeah . , think nvidia , big team people actually work . 'm talking head . think two thing , right ? one . work leadership team strategy , actually approach opportunity via q - toshiya hari - manuvir da q - toshiya hari - manuvir da q - toshiya hari - manuvir dasenterprise , think . second thing ecosystem talked , announcement see vmware snowﬂake , etcetera , spend lot time working ecosystem everybody win together , customer , partner ecosystem , course , nvidia coming along . 's great . thanks . jensen talk iphone moment . yeah . ai arriving . sort outsider , exposed chatgpt like . yeah . maybe late last year , maybe earlier year depending , fo stand . 'm sure saw earlier given , hopefully . describe aha moment broader nvidia team pertains big movement ? yeah . think 'll start saying , firstly think world large , really chatgpt aha moment , right , nvidia work closely openai , time , 're proud folk really every customer conversation llm generative ai , first question ask , looked tool kit openai provides . 's great starting point , go . right ? 've done great body work , right ? want put . think u , aha movement came , would say probably five year . probably , yeah , september 2019 first put first version library called megatron nvidia built , really framework kind training large language model . way think , know , year worked ai use case based called supervised learning . basically teach model giving human-generated example , right ? photograph . 'm telling car . know photograph , 'm telling dog , right ? , human go process creating lot data set fed training creates bottleneck creates barrier-to-entry . q - toshiya hari - manuvir dasand aha , advent unsupervised learning , think , lot people learn , right ? n't always learn sitting college professor teaching . learn absorbing what's happening llm , 's unsupervised learning put lot data front model learns . right . really aha movement built framework one hand called megatron training . secondly , realized needed different circuitry hardware , call transformer really accelerate form real learning . roadmap creating gpus , started pulling circuitry , transformer circuitry . right . happened year chatgpt . got . term customer engagement , leader enterprise computing must interact thousand -- ten thousand big customer potential customer either already deploying ai looking way leverage technology . give u feel customer engagement evolved since beginning year ? customer coming today ? yeah . think 'd start saying , . think 40,000 company working u technology . , . actually meet . bit challenge . dramatic shift , toshiya , would put way , right ? think year 've working company date year , customer conversation would always , well , 's use-case company care . customer care we'd pitching use-case . nvidia really many way made ai market different use case . created vertical vertical depending industry 're show fraud detection , example , would good use-case . lot conversation would . would say year customer come see u , already know use case , right ? 's intelligent assistant , helping employee , 's customer interaction , . conversation actually , okay nvidia , need know help work implement , right ? think good point point nvidia dna , 're platform company , right ? work ecosystem . rarely produce direct solution customer . right , encourage ecosystem . often conversation educate landscape technology stack . , let 's show work implement . right . 're underneath everybody . q - toshiya hari - manuvir da got . term long-term market potential ai , 's extremely diﬃcult stand predicting big could . perhaps 's challenging well . jensen , broader team throw couple number analyst day . $ 300 billion chip system , $ 150 billion nvidia ai enterprise software , another $ 150 billion omniverse enterprise software . guy construct something like , long-term tam , go ? bottom ? top ? bit ? kind share u , would helpful . yeah . think great topic maybe 's okay , 'll take couple minute unpack think 's important , right ? firstly , n't tam , right ? talk number , 're really talking long-term market opportunity see . 'll play -- year come play-out . think go back basic , fundamental thing see going , toshiya , new form computing beginning journey 's call accelerated computing . right , whole point , think traditional computing system based cpu computing , changed decade simply location . 're on-prem , 're cloud , 're phone , 's essentially style computing . world evolved , function company done computing , mean need computing world , mean need datacenters , need energy , need horsepower sustainable . 's sustainable trajectory , right ? saw , accelerated computing , way amount footprint 10 time work , 100 time work , going way . , simplest way thinking nvidia , made big bet . 's decade making , way forward going accelerated computing . okay ? , think market opportunity fundamental level , say footprint , 's $ 1 trillion spend datacenters , footprint already exists traditional computing , plus growth going happen year ahead , going shift traditional accelerated computing 've set nvidia forefront shift . analysis market opportunity start , 's going dramatic secular shift . believe strongly . ultimate killer app , , generative ai beginning market opportunity . q - toshiya hari - manuvir da q - toshiya hariand stuff , number , lot bottom-up ask , okay , break , much system hardware , right ? refresh cycle 's $ 300 billion came . software opportunity . interesting thing nvidia long time , 've invested lot software . would say probably 80 % r & last decade software , hardware , software come along hardware . reason , lot early shift develop ecosystem , researcher , r & need software , 's sort okay go pain adopting software , moving world production . moving world enterprise company betting business ai model running application need enterprise-grade software . reason put number software see incrementally nvidia year ahead , big opportunity actually operating system ai . run-time ai . model take run application , model need running 3 morning , right ? need supported enterprise-grade thing nvidia provider run- time , matter . 's incremental software opportunity come -- u . one hand , take secular shift . believe secular shift driven nvidia . 's big opportunity u . hand bottom-up , look individual part stack , , add . got . sound like still feel pretty good number timing . think . think realize 's generational change . 's multi-year transition industry going go 're long haul . yeah . got , got . csps sophisticated . informed . field enterprise . 'm sure pretty broad range term sophistication . guy quite bit democratize ai . think 've got framework . got partnership like snowﬂake vmware , hugging face , maybe talk significance partnership 're make easier customer deploy ai . - manuvir da yeah , thingi work think every day , toshiya . think couple different aspect democratizing , right ? think first thing need really understand power large language model llm democratization think understand used-case point-of-view , value , right , -- see every day . use chatgpt , see generative ai , generating image every day . think 's different way thinking , right ? thing ai , 's new form computing basically , corpus data , train model corpus data , 's learned ask question . sound great . challenge year first front-end part process high bar entry find data , right data , curate , go whole training process get usable model , right ? beautiful thing large language model , thing called pre-trained foundation model , right , smaller set people done work hundred million dollar many-many server large amount data trained model 're ready use , right , start , fine tune data use model . whole front end process done . right ? barrier entry , -- work customer , certainly . ai unicorn sitting large amount training every industry , company say , 'm forefront . i'm going train giant model , right , like bloomberg great example . think bread butter enterprise customer , great place start , let pick one pre-trained foundation model , right , whether somebody like openai 's llama 2 meta nvidia 's model . 's ultimate democratization , front end process diﬃcult , basically jump ahead , right , start output . fine tuning inference embed application . think technology level , 's one kind demonetization , right , work see . one ecosystem level . example , made announcement vmware recently . ? saying , one enterprise company want jump sort 75 % point take pre-trained model embed application , well , need ? need able take model , put briefcase take wherever application . 's need , right ? need -- vmware called private ai , basically , empowered pick model , right run-time use tool right . q - toshiya hari - manuvir dasi already farm server deployed vmware . team already know manage , right , scale , , right ? work people big transformation deployment . contract deloitte . contract accenture , right ? certain software platform use . ultimate level democratization , example , work servicenow , 've talked , right ? ultimate democratization ai work enterprise company , know 're ai . know 're working nvidia upgraded newer version servicenow infused ai work nvidia servicenow together . point view , got new functionality , right ? put another way , 're platform company . believe network network u , ultimate democratization ai nvidia going ecosystem application powered nvidia 's platform network customer company individually , sale team , sale team , right , 're taking nvidia technology customer 's really journey 're . 's great . dgx cloud , couple question . think 've recently introduced concept dgx cloud . level audience , describe dgx cloud ? come together ? work ? one question often get investor , actually end competing customer ? address concern , would great . , 'll start saying intention competing csps . fact , best partner , right , among best partner lot business together work lot customer get mutually csps , right ? think simplest way explain would , think server system built called dgx , right , 've worked many year on-premises , accelerating computing new kind paradigm . okay ? 's chip . 's system . 's networking , software , everything go . started journey , system manufacturer , dell , hp world , sold certain kind system customer expected procure certain kind system manufacturer really accelerated computing . , built system sort show way , scout team , right , established dgx use case helped system manufacturer understand new computing model actually interesting 's market . soon realized market , actually took secret sauce dgx . actually took internals productized engineered q - toshiya hari - manuvir da q - toshiya hari - manuvir dassolution gave system manufacturer . said , go sell system , build-your-own system ip , sell . 're actually happy sell one system customer , going scale business dgx . dgx scout team , right , 're always innovating putting next stuff . , way came dgx cloud exactly thought process , cloud , see customer work cloud , especially ai . 's journey said csps , within cloud , mutually create footprint nvidia dgx technology , putting footprint next step computing , right ? need networking , storage , quite intertwined , computer single computer , whole set server datacenter . worked . put footprint . customer come . experienced latest engaged advance expectation fact csps watch operation say , okay , thank much nvidia . 'm scaling , 've got , right ? 's really good outcome everybody , customer , csps [ ph ] . jensen make statement want best sale team csps , like system manufacturer , right ? think 's see . okay . make sense . seems like response far positive . yeah , think 's great relationship . working csps keen expand footprint . okay . got . mean , talked dgx work system partner definitely want go . recently introduced l40s gpu . maybe spend couple minute describing significance l40s system business oem business gone know 's important route enterprise well . think know , 've realized 've got point accelerated computing system manufacturer , mainstream product line 've -- eventually point product line accelerated computing nvidia . l40s really saying two world n't separate world anymore . mainstream server line , every server gpu . 's think datacenters headed . q - toshiya hari - manuvir dasi want say , toshiya , know , ask thing make nvidia special , okay , build gpus , 's one architecture . one programming model based cuda . mean see market 're able produce family gpus different situation . programmed way . , developer ecosystem n't different thing . l40s , okay ? know hopper generation , h100 . 's high demand . right . obviously , working certain way chip packaged , system packaged . beauty l40s , 's really good back-end workﬂow talked , fine-tuning , inﬂuence , course , training , 's really go back-end 's constructed way , right . n't requirement chip-making process hopper family . right . creates another channel supply , , kind computing infrastructure everything designed fit standard server , form factor , power consumption , . journey . announced dell , hpe , lenovo , number several manufacturer . think 100 odd system coming online , customer say , tech refreshing , datacenters going-forward , know , rack stack . right . 's standard server rack stack , put one server gpu . reason many different use case , whether 's ai data processing 's plethora use case save money one server much single cpu server . right . 's adding secular movement . step back say , look inside datacenter today see many server typical datacenter today gpu , 's single digit percentage , right ? expect see year road majority server gpus , getting right system l40s process like one part , working developer ecosystem , 4 million developer domain move more-and-more domain accelerated computing , different use case , mean , journey . right . think guy extremely dominant training . think competitive setup landscape inference little bit nuanced , something like l40s , sound like , effective addressing inference market . yeah . think 's course hardware . 're proud chip innovate chip rapid fashion standing body work , right ? 's hardware 've developed time , circuitry . remember , 're 80 % software company software hardware team work conjunction , right ? reason h100 well deep q - toshiya hari q - unidentified participant - manuvir daslearning llm inference software team nvidia forefront figuring actually want chip , right , allows build right chip , right . inference , 's clear u many year training lead inference . right . two movement going . okay ? one hand , understand training one-off thing , okay , happens train model , model good data trained . reality , 're running business , 're getting new data every day . training one-and-done . clear , right , training done continuously . big company going call ai factory 're basically training time . clearly , useful 're using model application 's inference . 've spent last year really designing hardware especially software stack inference , right ? think 's -- big opportunity going forward . said , every place 're inference , one run-time . pick take briefcase along model today run model want run , datacenter , colo , public cloud choice , to2 csp , workstation , pc , one run-time , world , take work anywhere , 's nvidia software runtime inference . right . 's hardware opportunity software opportunity . really fascinating . 'm going pause see , guess one person . mics room ? check first . thank . first , congratulation success . struck comment nvidia positioning operating system ai application . given given support openai , responsibility think company like nvidia make certain ai used non-nefarious way kind service offer enterprise-grade customer care ability audit result , make certain result put non-troublesome ( multiple speaker ) 's great question like fact use word responsibility responsible ai , think thing , right ? , 're platform company , right ? job provide foundational technology . , think two way . right ? first way point view company deploying ai , empower run ai way want , right ? make portable ? q - unidentified participant - manuvir dasand produce software stack take , right ? run ai building , premise . compliance regime , right ? data sitting certain place . instead making come ai , bring ai . right ? 's one part . second part hardware . work confidential computing . we've got -- latest generation hardware built-in think , model ip , right ? model software . protect model deployed running ? , 've done work hardware create confidential computing world ai . 's one aspect . tooling , provide software tool like technology called guardrail allows control model actually , question n't answer , control much hallucination get use model , right ? think 's one part . aspect responsible ai , start data , right , ip model actually came data . , data coming ? sourced ? right people actually contributed data , getting economic credit producing data ? work company like getty image , shutterstock , licensed content , right ? 're nvidia , 're enabling create model generative ai , based data set sourced responsibly . right . , example , work wpp company advertising realm , able reliably take output model built getty shutterstock , etcetera , knowing get asset , 're using campaign , complete knowledge came responsibly sourced , right . think 's aspect , , data coming ? responsibly sourced ? think 's many aspect general one company ecosystem , certainly big focus nvidia . hi , talk inference opportunity nvidia opposed training ? would share inference maybe three year versus training share ? 's great question . noticed generally philosophically 're company think , 25 % share something 40 % share something . think view simple computer , server workstation going forward , 'll position 'll used inference . believe working best hardware software stack inference . , 's answer . q - toshiya hari - manuvir da q - toshiya hari - manuvir da wanted squeeze supply question . 's best place end , wanted squeeze . 's secret supply-demand mismatch today . guess , , significant supply-demand mismatch extent quantify ? head enterprise computing , plan business supply tight gpus point would expect supply-demand meet , ? yeah , 's great question interesting one end . would say , firstly , said , yes , definitely see demand supply . 've talked earnings . 've racing increase supply . think partner supply chain done exceptional job working u increase supply . talked l40s minute ago . 've also found way increase supply way . think 's process multiple quarter year . think good thing customer one hand journey put new footprint datacenters , take multiple quarter . meanwhile , part increase supply next quarter think 's sort natural balance two thing . sit tell exactly 's going happen , think feel pretty good fact 've taken step increase supply . meanwhile , customer journey see sort happening conjunction , go . said , 's secular shift , right ? 's something focused one quarter . sure , sure . guess last 60 second , obviously , 're playing big growing market . core everything . anything missed conversation anything want highlight group let go ? think main thing 'd point , zoom enough , right , know we're focused llm generative ai . 's killer application . really we're seeing , right , 's -- 's coming fruition finally , move new computing platform world really needed accelerated computing large language model generative ai , killer app convincing everybody adopt platform , adopt platform , 's going much far-reaching effect , workload like data processing normally traditional computing , going accelerated dramatically . footprint , 're going able 10 time amount work , 100 time amount work could existing footprint q - toshiya hari - manuvir dastoday . important saving money , energy footprint world . 's cusp 's truly excited nvidia , 's see opportunity going forward . 's conﬂuence two thing need right application really drive people new platform open opportunity new platform provides , right ? 's really looking going forward 're super-excited . amazing . really enjoyed conversation . congratulation everything thank much . really appreciate time . thank . thank time .
