's lot stuff amazing cloud all-in . reality customer going different constraint fast move cloud . customer say , ' '' hey would like regulated entity inside organization stay on-prem everybody else move cloud . ' '' think hybrid , set user basis department basis site oﬃce basis . customer say , ' '' know , great . let 's get calendaring mail conferencing delivered cloud . want keep portal on-prem . ' '' oﬃce 365 let hybrid way . mean , look , 're business serving enterprise , know one size n't fit . want provide best possible stuff cloud . fully support hybrid configuration oﬃce 365 azure . , continue build on-premise version product . reality cloud version getting progressively richer richer . , gap exist . servicing on-prem customer well . back one size n't fit . 've also taken different skus oﬃce given basic low-level feature . subscribe oﬃce 365 $ 9.99 , believe , $ 10 roughly month . n't enterprise e5 sku , think brings price point $ 35 per user per month lot new feature set . talk think go market term availability ? think e5 relatively new . ? yes . . 's great question . oﬃce 365 , would say , , competitive product e-communication , collaboration , security , infrastructure customer . enterprise , call e1 . best set experience . think 's area 'll continue add value time . like recently launched microsoft team 's available e1 . committed e1 customer , broadest tank . one great thing 've seen happen business customer opted , premium skus . e3 market year . take look premium skus , think sku mix today , premium sku mix , upward 60 % . , see value e3 . e3 's e1 ? well 've got oﬃce client . e1 get web client bring client . e3 get always up-to-date cloud-updated oﬃce client end point . get security compliance feature . q - brent thill - rajesh jha q - brent thill - rajesh jhathen , e5 something excited . 's still early e5 . customer trialing . 've seen early interest three key pillar e5 , advanced security compliance , advanced analytics . voice . lot capability voice . 's 've set skus commercially . could given workload . customer tend get entire suite . may start workload . get entire suite -- add value premium tier . role ai popular topic valley conference . yes . start think different application 're powering , kind knowing , 's role ai initiative going forward ? 's huge . mean , look , first thing , people tell deliver ai , first thing 've got wonder ; unique data , unique signal ? oﬃce , billion billion data point . user interact product , signaling u . share document , brent , 's signal . email -- somebody sends email dwell seven eight minute email versus typical minute two , 's signal . signal data , oﬃce 365 treat customer ' data customer ' signal . ? , 've got lot lot , billion endpoint data signal . , bring machine learning ai technique natural language processing give back end user customer unique insight . let give couple example . let 's say 're editing document word . 're preparing report think , ' '' maybe want reuse chart report seen somewhere work group . ' '' n't quite remember shared . want reuse one chart . today feature oﬃce 365 called word tap . literally one tap onto ribbon use ai technique bring relevant document 've seen past may interesting content 're writing . auto-bring thing right pane . q - brent thill - rajesh jha q - brent thill - rajesh jhascroll right pane . tap chart see , boom , 's word document . , instead going , leaving word , going search , trying filter search , trying remember sent thing , ai signal brings back word . give lot lot example thing . think ai helping user get time back , get value back , whether term eﬃciency automating task . 'm also excited ai 's perspective . place use ai oﬃce 365 call security graph . , see ton ton malware thrown customer . see oﬃce . colleague see directory azure . see window . triangulate signal overlay giving customer , guy , insight threat , targeted user , device may compromised , suggesting protection . lot data lot signal , opportunity use ml ai give value back user customer . really excited . 've got bunch idea . 've scared lot business intelligence user power bi bundle broader solution . think standalone bi player 're , talk role power bi ? yes . mean think 's lot interesting work happening area analytics industry . mean vision power bi data science , everybody data scientist . want democratize mean analyze data , filter , draw insight . , power bi , many way think next logical step excel . mean lot analysis excel . power bi rich dashboarding bind oﬃce data . bind line business data . spirit investment analytics time back , money back , value back end user , democratize data science . stats give u term initiative ? 've , think , last pushing pretty hard . kind broad data point kind support 's happening power bi adoption ? mean power bi , today , part e5 . still early e5 . 's would say month -- maybe year market . pleased q - brent thill - rajesh jha q - brent thillwith , like said , three key vision pillar e5 . one around advanced security compliance . around analytics . third one around voice . three pillar resonating customer . would say probably security one 've seen early adoption . 'm really pleased customer feedback opportunity , market opportunity three pillar representing u today . well 've watching kind formation dynamic quite time acquisition organic build . seems like really exciting business . sound like 're spending lot time business doubling . talk relationship oﬃce 365 dynamic family ? yes . mean 's lot , lot -- excited dynamic 365. , question build . context dynamic application still want using product , really , tool used . dynamic , embed excel . bind sharepoint . right inside dynamic experience 're getting oﬃce experience . oﬃce thing reach dynamic data . another thing 've done , think going -- 's going super beneficial user customer , common notion collaboration . done azure active directory , plumbed notion group . u work context different group . nobody today modern society work alone . always work context group . , 've plumbed lowest layer active directory . , group direct report group product launch group dedicated given customer , whether 're dynamic , whether 're outlook , whether 're yammer , whether 're word , group name space show . go onedrive , quickly filter document related group . go dynamic , still see entire context filtered group . work across dynamic oﬃce pretty deep layer . think 's foundational experience might change . make experience super well integrated across two . skype , 's -- 's great asset . obviously purchased large sum money . - rajesh jha q - brent thill - rajesh jha q - brent thill - rajesh jha q - brent thill - rajesh jha q - brent thill yes . lot question investor . able truly take value asset make valuable could ? walk ultimate vision skype ? yes . mean , actually , think economic engine oﬃce 365 , would say core workload today enterprise messaging calendaring exchange outlook . 've got , course , productivity suite , oﬃce . sharepoint storage portal . skype big one u . mean , today , e5 especially , get skype get single experience span voice , video , conferencing , application sharing , presence . look innovation come recently 've seen , today 's oﬃce 365 feature , skype broadcast broadcast something skype entire organization . going transcription , natural language transcription , translation different language . , 'm actually quite pleased rate innovation adoption skype deeply integrated oﬃce go market . team launch , lot interest . obviously , ceo showed presentation . . highlight 's probably really important thing . 's lot talk collaborative solution market , whether 's slack hipchat solution . sure . maybe tell u little bit team different product 've past relatively differentiated competitor - rajesh jhaout . 's great question , brent . would first say communication collaboration basic human need . modern productivity , economic activity start people working together . start think ; people work together ? one size fit . account team 's trying connect bunch customer select set people inside company 's one set interaction model . 're ceo 're trying reach employee get feedback , 's another kind collaboration communication pattern . 're bunch folk getting together , high-energy , trying launch product , bunch developer writing code . oﬃce 365 , want want give complete toolkit collaboration . believe -- talked notion group plumbed common level . , want recognize people collect together group . group open . group closed . group super large . private . , common notion group whether 're collaborating mail , sharing calendar notebook , whether set document 're sharing , 've got common plumbing . yammer understands theme group . let connect across network open way . , sharepoint ability go internet portal . team , adding toolkit collaboration common fabric . team effort focused bunch people , bringing bunch people together , content together , application they're working together . look , 's differentiated -- mean , look , slack done amazing work hipchat around long time loyal following . team actually building collaboration toolkit oﬃce 365. benefit oﬃce . day one , 's going 18 language 180 country . day one , going compliant . 've got iso , cgs , hipaa data , 've got full compliance . , end user perspective , brings tool right experience . 're team experience , pin sharepoint page , pin excel document . 150 different integration possible including hootsuite zendesk asana many others . , overall , mean framing 's microsoft team alone . making oﬃce 365 best collaboration toolkit . customer q - brent thill - rajesh jha q - brent thill - rajesh jhahave oﬃce 365 , want make sure 've got different way team may collaborating full toolkit . onenote great product . maybe n't level light . there's lot evernote groupie . get evernote groupie get onenote ? yes . let start pushing little bit . look , oﬃce got 1 billion user . hard compare something like onenote something like delve something like word outlook 1 billion , 0.5 billion user . onenote actually -- mean seeing great adoption onenote segment . mean let take ed , example . mean see level inking support onenote math problem . auto recognizes formula . allow teacher auto-provision notebook every classroom . , bringing onenote organization actually introducing rest organization full oﬃce 365. think surface hub , new -- new anymore -- collaboration big screen interface . onenote whiteboard application . term migration evernote , released toolkit sometime earlier year maybe late last year lot user actually taken advantage move digital memory forward onenote . onenote pretty key filler oﬃce today , oﬃce line business . probably tie dynamic business . adobe earlier talked partnership moving infrastructure back end think . 've marketing automation term helping user use . maybe talk little bit 's happening adobe partnership ? yes . let make broader point partnership . mean , look , always start , discussion , always start couple thing . mean obvious thing . first ; 's best thing mutual customer ? second thing ; better together opportunity u go build experience better partner ? adobe , obvious , obvious case u go . another one would point red hat . done red hat allowed enterprise customer given choice hybrid environment . really cool microsoft red hat got together give customer completely unified support experience . q - brent thill - rajesh jha q - brent thill - rajesh jha q - brent thill - rajesh jhado n't know whether support call taken microsoft taken red hat . vein talk stuff 've done docusign sap ; salesforce.com . salesforce well-integrated product . think would take broader look partnership . actually , build little bit , brent , would say , oﬃce especially , renewed commitment last three , four year modern extensibility . oﬃce always extensible . added modern extensibility . allow partner plug experience new add-in interface . rest apis microsoft graph let connect oﬃce 365. , mean 's place expect u continue . 's handful question 's common theme around linkedin . know n't closed ca n't probably say much . 's pretty powerful think thing guy could together impact oﬃce family . look impact outlook application , example , someone leaf job perhaps get populate data someone changed phone number email . 're saying . 'm saying . mean love kind interview 're asking question answering . guess one example . maybe perspective think biggest impact franchise . yes . look , 'm excited linkedin . really ca n't say lot . mean i'm happy come back 's closed let process play respectful process . 'm excited could . okay . keep talking benefit see . please . maybe little bit e5 adoption . 's driving ? important voice ? yes . 'm sure good job explaining tiering oﬃce . say , customer move cloud . let 's say start mail calendar . generates lot data content cloud . good job serving need build confidence , may end moving something like sharepoint skype cloud u . generates data custodian cloud . next thing customer want want thing like e-discovery put legal hold want protect data . want analytics data . lead e3 . basic level data leakage protection conditional lapse [ ph ] . course , operational security built oﬃce 365. want advanced analytics . want advanced security , well , 's get e3 . , stuff like advanced threat protection voice power bi get e5 . guess 'm saying usage user , data . data , right earn give premium value part e3 e5 . 's basic thesis adding e5 value . like said , e5 , three thrust . security compliance 're really excited set stuff able bring customer . power bi something call myanalytics analytics side . , example , n't know guy seen capability . oﬃce , 're e5 user , 'd able see , one insight ; losing touch ? auto-suggest . sent piece email -- many sent piece email , let 's say , 30 , 40 people ? many ? would n't want know many time got read read rate thing ? super -- 're respectful privacy . 's le five people , wo n't give insight . let 's say send 20 , 30 people , 'd able see read rate . many reply forward mail ? kind analytics insight . 's second pillar . third one , let talk little bit voice oﬃce 365 e5 . lot voice capability excited . first thing -- conferencing e3 oﬃce . conferencing , customer , could voice conferencing completely based cloud . customer would bring pstn conferencing . , built e5 . one-stop shop conferencing need . another one pbx system . complicated manage . complicated update . run completely cloud . 's proposition voice e5 . third one , microsoft actually give q - brent thill - rajesh jha q - brent thill - rajesh jha q - brent thill - rajesh jhaphone number calling plan many country . think value voice , three component value . say give phone number -- get phone number microsoft . e5 , pstn calling , 's feature . pretty compelling . good question . role file system . say launch -- new window 10 machine launched , log , , sudden , onedrive pop authentication saved . talk little bit importance onedrive 's headed ? yes . mean one thing n't done lot n't talked oﬃce 365 consumer business . quite happy consumer business . 24 million subscriber today oﬃce 365 consumer space . value user get get terabyte storage onedrive . onedrive great integration , mentioned , back core device . , get always up-to-date client . ai feature talked start show subscriber . ai feature kind thing ca n't easily on-prem customer . , 's differentiation u actually put value cloud . think onedrive core part value proposition oﬃce user . 're consumer get terabyte storage up-to-date client part 365 consumer subscription . 're enterprise get onedrive business . compliance capability reliability -- reliability geo distribution 're multinational choose set user onedrive europe , set user onedrive north america . capability offer onedrive commercial space . several question around security specifically around email security 're , given many breach happen via email . q - brent thillyes . , email -- 's universal communication dial tone . , 's always risk abuse email . one feature 's really resonating u e5 today something called advanced threat protection . idea advanced threat protection actually quite simple , ; look , oﬃce 365 protect malware . course , part e1 . lot threat zero day malware signature updated . people send bad link . link n't bad got . link turn bad later , fact . malware worked , go hack website click link that's get phished . advanced threat protection basically detonates -- know , use word detonate kind symbolic way -- every attachment every link virtual machine try see nothing malicious . thing uniquely -- , att available market another offering couple vendor . something uniquely ? today , problem advanced threat protection send phishing mail , brent , mail probably going delayed five minute , sometimes seven minute detonation take time . oﬃce 365 'll give mail right away . reading bunch mail could read mail right away . click attachment , attachment , click attachment able detonate test , say ' '' scanned ' '' . mail attachment third thing looking , chance 've finished detonating 've gone updated inbox . message inbox attachment . call instant delivery . deliver right away . detonate background . update write inbox soon got . kind integration security . security business oﬃce 365 ? data . experience . let give another example . threat protection . 's easy tell u , ' '' hi . n't . n't . ' '' , oﬃce surface area , 'm outlook 'm sending mail 'm forwarding attachment somebody 's organization , outlook detect business rule , right , tell , ' '' hi . want . still want send anyway ? 'll audited . ' '' kind thing . lot lot example security value 've added oﬃce tier ; e1 , e3 . e5 . , guess 's number question like potential partnership , better opportunity work closely third-party security vendor like proofpoint , mimecast . , relationship working ? - rajesh jha q - brent thill - rajesh jha q - brent thill - rajesh jha well mail -- 're customer security vendor want filter mail , could . point mx record vendor mail routed vendor finished get routed oﬃce 365. kind integration already possible . easily doable , course , thing like talked like instant delivery operationally closed detonation happening mail delivered physically closed given data center . kind thing think uniquely . basic level integration vendor totally possible today routing mx record . 's question around statistic around dynamic crm attaching broader oﬃce 365 's sale . yes . n't top head . 's good follow-up u . okay . question around subscription versus product . think going forward 365 ? oh , mean cloud versus on-premise ? yes . 's really good question . let give anecdotal data first . four year ago , would say -- yes , maybe four year ago , talking bunch cio thinking moving cloud . biggest feedback , ' '' well ca n't move cloud n't feature x , , z cloud get on-prem . ' '' today , discussion entirely different . today , look thing like microsoft team . took look delve . took look ai , threat intelligence graph . one accrues 're cloud . today , cloud clearly better term complete solution . 's - - like said , committed customer serve on-prem allow hybrid . bunch ai ml stuff 's incredibly hard . ai ml require lot compute lot access data , lot lot signal . 's super hard lift cloud infrastructure move on-prem . q - brent thill - rajesh jha q - brent thill - rajesh jha q - brent thillso think whole discussion changed . , talk customer , issue ' '' hi . could bring cloud value on-prem ? ' '' point hybrid configuration . excellent . thank time . . thank , brent . really appreciate insight . yes . thanks , guy .
