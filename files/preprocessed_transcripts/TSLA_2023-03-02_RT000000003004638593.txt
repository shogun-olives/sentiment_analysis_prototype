's bit preview piece 're building , looking ahead future autonomous ﬂeets : synchronization , permission management , security privacy . whirlwind tour thing 're behind scene enable eﬃciency , cost reduction speed going need next phase growth next phase master plan . , tell u latest full self-driving , 'd like introduce , ashok . thanks , david pete . hey , everyone . name ashok elluswamy . work autopilot self-driving tesla . joined tesla back 2014. 've working problem almost nine year . yeah . might wondering , hey , 's self-driving got plan sustainable future ? 's actually critical part plan ? currently , car used , sitting idly parking lot , anything . autonomy truly unlocked , car , instead idle , go serve customer . fundamentally reduces need scale manufacturing extreme level car used way . trivial problem . building scalable , self-driving system think one hardest real-world ai problem right . nonetheless , tesla , made significant stride making one general system solving problem . three main part get right build scalable problem . first architecture , architecture ai system . second data third compute . 'll start architecture . tesla , betting ai machine learning neural network help u build general vision planning system . early day , used single camera , single frame neural network produce output . stitched together post-processing step planner . brittle leading great success . last year transition stack multi camera video neural network . neural network take live feed car real time eight camera car produce single unified 3d output space . many task produce presence obstacle , motion , lane , road , traﬃc light , ? one example output 're seeing . occupancy network predicts position obstacle motion . see precisely capture ( inaudible ) violent motion truck next u help planning system avoid collision object . task lane connectivity complicated model using navy method computer vision . , n't stop computer vision technique , reach technique area language modeling , reinforcement learning model task . similar -- network use similar technique transformer , attention module , autoregressive modeling token similar language model like chatgpt . end-to-end system solving perception , really removed brittle post-processing step produced high quality output planning system . even planning system stuck old way ; starting use ai system solve problem . neural network-based planner needed especially complicated urban planning , 's lot object interacting u . example intersection , turn left yielding crossing object pedestrian crossing road . safely smoothly respecting everyone 's right-of-way preference . done naively , configuration would take 10 millisecond compute easily thousand configuration reason . would feasible using traditional compute . using ai , packaged 50 millisecond compute budget run real time . second big piece puzzle data . tesla unique advantage tap ﬂeet access exact data fix problem . raw data suﬃcient . -- order train network , need label data , need label supervise network . depended human labelers , data would tiny train large multi camera video module . need lot lot data train network . hence , built sophisticated auto-labeling pipeline collect data ﬂeet , run computational algorithm data center produce label train network . , seeing 3d reconstruction happening collecting various clip different car ﬂeet assembling together single unified representation world around car . see lane , road boundary , curb , crosswalk , even text road accurately reconstructed algorithm . n't stop kind reconstruction . base reconstruction , build various simulation top produce infinite variety data train corner case . capable simulator synthesize adversarial weather , lighting condition even motion object test corner case might even rare real world . 's example data critical solve problem using data . back day , example , case , false breaking thought car 's actually parked going move path hence , precautiously braking . unnecessary car truly parked . solve ? mined ﬂeet similar case car false braking due parked car . added 14,000 video training set . trained network new data , correctly understands okay , driver car must parked , need brake . systematic way solve problem . chart right side , see every time add data , performance improves . every kind task system . call data engine . identify challenging case one saw earlier could different type challenging case . mine ﬂeet data , put auto labeling system produce label added training set . newly trained model , deploy onto ﬂeet . rinse repeat process , everything get better better . final critical piece compute . order train large model reasonable amount time , need lot compute . addition , compute also required produce label automatically . compute data center . addition , also high computer car , run like 150 teraops compute . back end , 14,000 gpu cluster roughly 30 % used auto labeling remaining 70 % used training . also 30 petabyte video cash growing 200 petabyte . going significantly increase bring dojo , training computer onboard . give reference , occupancy network saw earlier use 1.4 billion frame train network . already shipped fsd beta software pretty much everyone bought united state canada . amount roughly 400,000 customer turn anywhere car would attempt drive destination , still supervised already handle turn , stop traﬃc light , yield object generally get destination . observed people use fsd already 5x 6x safer u.s. national average . like , mentioned earlier , solution scalable fsd getting ai architecture , data compute right . assembled world-class team execute . pushing frontier three item improve safety , reliability comfort system , elon r. musk ashok elluswamy elon r. muskunlock driverless operation , make car use way used right . , 'd like introduce elon back stage give update . video ? yeah , next leg video . 's weird seeing arm leg separate . whole lab full arm leg bearing mind ai day , ( inaudible ) n't work . , rate improvement , think quite significant . 's obviously parkour [ ph ] , walking around multiple copy , suppose optimus . think 's -- think tesla brings table others n't real-world ai -- 're advanced real-world ai . ai drive car , think car really robot wheel robot leg . , solve real-world ai , n't think 's -- n't think 's anyone even close tesla solving real-world ai , computer software go optimus . 's helpful humanoid robot program every individual action . need able walk around autonomously solve task . able instruct simple thing showing visually 're -- robot need telling . , think 's key advantage also good designing thing manufacturing manufacturing . actuator optimus custom design tesla actuator . , design like electric motor gearbox , power electronics , obviously battery pack everything else go optimus . 're actually quite -- quite surprised find little available shelf 's lot -- vast number electric motor gearbox whatnot available world . found none useful humanoid robot , virtually none . , custom design actuator humanoid robot . , team designed ground-breaking electric motor say , model plaid designed actuator robot . , mean practical purpose mean able bring actual product market scale useful far faster anyone else . assuming thing 'm saying true least put -- think true , unidentified speaker elon r. musk unidentified speaker elon r. musk rebecca tinuccijust question timing , start getting interesting question like , 's ratio human humanoid robot ? think might greater one- to-one . sort see use -- home use robot , certainly industrial us robot -- humanoid robot . think might exceed one-to-one ratio humanoid robot human . 's even clear economy mean point since economy output per person time person , output much higher 's limit person , 's actual limit economy ? 're still pretty far kardashev scale , 're getting . anyway , probably least understood appreciated part we're tesla probably worth significantly car side thing long term . charge -- think rebecca next right . -- talking charging . charge . hi , . name rebecca tinucci , lead charging infrastructure team tesla . tesla charging , understood since day one great charging experience linchpin electric vehicle adoption . understanding meant 've always taken holistic approach charging . 's word 've heard lot today , mean charging , 've considered every use case . think lot mean charge home , even home apartment condo , spend lot time thinking , mean charge away home including 's daily commuting 're going road trip . holistic approach led pretty incredible result . 2022 , provided 9 terawatt hour charging across various charging method , 50 % supplied via convenient ac home charging . customer away home , visit one 80,000 charging point includes 40,000 beloved supercharger . getting meant 've spent ten year building charging infrastructure basically one else industry would . , certainly lot area want improve , 10 year afforded u opportunity get pretty good charging . first , industry 's lowest deployment cost . cost often 20 % , 70 % lower alternative go supercharging hardware deployment ac charging product line . lot reason 're able achieve . 've heard lot today , 've vertically integrated manufacture engineer charging equipment . share component across different product line . supercharger side , also install operate site 's led u pretty obsessed finding new way innovate around installation . example , recently extended excellence manufacturing build supercharger site . pre-building post-supercharger unit factory giga -- factory new york . load truck . truck site crane position . method save u 15 % deployment cost install site matter day . install site , also operate really eﬃciently . last year , 've able cut per kilowatt-hour cost 40 % . , lot reason one top list 've focused increasing site utilization . site utilization many session kilowatt-hours push site post , basically allows u spread cost session , thus lower cost per kilowatt hour . course , 's easier said done , push side eﬃciency , course , risk poor customer experience wait time site . trip planner come . trip planner in-vehicle routing navigation system . electric vehicle manufacturer vehicle side data , infrastructure provider site data . tesla , . allows u use trip planner route vehicle towards available site away congested site balance utilization without risking wait time . result speak . last year , 've able drive site utilization 30 % , mean lower per kilowatt-hour cost , also cutting wait time half . think get even better . today , 're feeding trip planner real-time site information information vehicle currently site . going forward , 'll moving projecting site occupancy based understanding vehicle currently routing site . ultimately , vision trip planner 's air-traﬃc controller electric vehicle charging across infrastructure global basis . last thing focused get quicker charge time . 're really proud 've able accomplish . 've shaved 30 % charge time -- average supercharging site time , visit time last year . taken improvement hardware side , software vehicle infrastructure 're really excited continue pushing trend . looking forward , job get easier . heard earlier , aspire fully electrified global ﬂeet . ﬂeet industry standpoint need 9 petawatt hour charging annual basis . tesla charging certainly supply , require part , new focus order scale . first , want fully electrified global ﬂeet , vehicle great reliable charging experience . , many know , recently , started opening network global basis . 50 % supercharger europe currently open electric vehicle . 've also opened asia-pacific first site australia yesterday , opened first 10 supercharger site north america u.s. electric vehicle . 've also invested lot able make really easy experience new customer . sign tesla app unlock post start charging . 've also -- physical site change , 've also added hardware site , 're called magic dock basically , installed area different charging standard allow electric vehicle come site without bring adapter hardware . 've also started installing fourth generation , supercharger post , installed europe first .

's much lower capex per gigawatt hour output go scale objective 240 total terawatt-hours , 1 terawatt year , stationary storage 20 million vehicle year , scalability required achieve goal . 're looking cell factory , also upstream material necessary . see -- rendering 50 gigawatt hour year . corpus christi lithium refinery 've already broken ground texas , facility start commissioning end 2023 year . good example something 're basically talking breaking ground starting commissioning within 10 month actual production within 12 month , 's target , similar shanghai , result collaboration internal execution construction partnership local community . third , site 30 minute corpus christi port , located directly rail . process route 're taking direct soda ash leach input material , mean acid roasting . n't sort waste product associated acid roasting step . 're designed consume lithium spodumene , commonly traded lithium rock . ﬂexible feed primary secondary source . similarly , 're working cathode facility texas . maybe 've seen 're driving around , 60 gigawatt-hour year cathode facility behind main building , 10 month build time well . install -- equipment installed first line speak commissioning starting next quarter . need . plan always . lot confident company , also trying sort accelerate pace industry trying new thing little bit scalable de-risking certain innovation improve productivity per -- term capex per gigawatt-hour thing like . , think sum effort factory side . mike , want come 'll talk energy . right , take away . right . hello , everyone . name mike schneider . lead megapack organization . 've tesla almost nine year . 'm excited talk today megapack product business exciting thing ahead u . andrew d. baglino michael snyder andrew d. baglino michael snyder andrew d. baglino michael snyderfrom beginning business , always focused building successful project customer battery box . we've built hardware software platform able adapt environment world , able scale small island project large gigawatt- hour scale battery . 've invested time talent best understand every aspect , every step process every risk project ultimately provide solution thoughtful , intuitive , provides great value customer plug-and-play possible . yeah , looking project , 's incredible see come together one montage . seeing future . yeah . 's compressed . 's 10 year building project 's incredible see impact see front u . absolutely . 're sixth generation industrial product , megapack xl 're building lathrop , california . 've deployed 16 gigawatt- hour industrial residential product across 50 country really megapack market leader . best-in-class eﬃciency , reliability , energy density easiest install , lowest cost install . call xl actually like largest , heaviest object transfer around road world without shut get crazy permit thing like . extra large . going xxl , let 's say way . 's incredible demand project -- product . 2023 going great year . gigawatt-hour scale project built , lathrop factory continues scale ramp sinew product near-term roadmap . lot look forward . andrew d. baglino michael snyder andrew d. baglino michael snyder andrew d. baglinohow get ? number one , maniacal focus aspect delivering stationary storage . mean ? example ? see , megapack enclosure one example , designed wire way directly base enclosure . typically , need install bunch conduit cable ground . , lift install directly base , increasing speed deployment lowering cost . next , see battery power electronics power electronics really beauty elegance megapack . , convert dc power ac power grid . brain built directly product . able connect grid world right box . allows -- megapacks given site work one unit . really , 's make . think 's incredible feature megapack . build full site , end energy solution market upwards 300 megawatt hour per acre . frame reference , solution 2x power dense typical gas peaker plant . future , 're going . product retires fossil fuel . yeah . one power plant time . 'll talk power electronics little bit . tesla leader power electronics . 've deployed 1.4 terawatts across energy storage vehicle deliver power electronics solar wind industry combined per annum basis . power electronics , 's hard -- overstate impactful . really glue sustainable energy economy generation , storage end-use . power electronics device switching thousand time per second -- hundred thousand time per second eﬃciently react whatever needed either car grid like sort software driven core , provide functionality n't available grid past 's one reason renewables storage together great solution . michael snyder andrew d. baglino michael snyder andrew d. baglino michael snyder yeah . one reason focus power electronics control much impact project directly . , example left , firmware feature call virtual machine mode , virtual machine mode contributes grid stability like car shock absorber dampens oscillation vibration keep ride smooth . imagine n't dampen vibration , vehicle could lose control someone could get hurt . grid , could blackout . one grid operator utilizing virtual machine mode said operate grid 100 % renewables unless feature -- unless virtual machine mode working . yeah . tried n't work well . virtually virtual machine ( inaudible ) like synthetic inertia , turn battery power plant like software behaving like 's giant spinning machine literally like inertia stabilizes grid . n't -- n't need giant spinning machine . n't need like huge fossil fuel power plant giant hydro turbine . 're going battery . program whatever need part grid even dynamically changing grid condition change , right ? 's focus much believe 's future battery going add value , 's going adding power stability energy . autobidder another software feature wanted mention . autobidder autonomous energy trading platform basic sens , buying energy low selling high owner net difference . operating battery storage actually complex , upwards -- needing upwards hundred even thousand decision every 5 minute . 's much complex pv , solar plant wind plant thermal battery , thermal generation plant . 's mostly versatility ability battery provide much value different way decision need made real time andrew d. baglinoorder optimize get value battery . n't solution existed market . built one market 've market , 've deployed , australia , texas , uk . proven market leader . 're continuing invest autobidder expand new market . second point got ? relentless focus speed execution 's two point made . first one building factory . seeing time lapse mega factory built lathrop . took jc penney distribution center world-class manufacturing facility le 12 month , incredible . really way similar colleague described , 's leveraging vertical integration tesla . 's getting vehicle manufacturing team room construction engineering making decision quickly decision -- stakeholder decision-makers . 're using lesson learned lathrop speak , plan next factory . second , 's installing project faster . 've mentioned already , plug- and-play kind core 're going . past four year , 've increased installation speed 4x 've reduced total labor involved across construction manufacturing 3x . think key unlocking ability scale customer ability scale u . need make laser focused reducing time megapack leaf factory operational grid . 's centralized storage . 's also distributed storage , future roadmap ( inaudible ) tesla . maybe know sort retail plan texas wanted talk little bit fit together . tesla electric really unlocks full value distributed energy storage product . enables , customer become utility . data page south australia virtual power plant , another tesla electric setup . 2022 , 's 5,000 customer data . get sense 's happening . provided default utility service looked cost serving electricity , average , $ 140 month . solar powerwall , solar powerwall n't interacting grid , n't participating energy market , cost serving customer would go -- would half , go $ 140 month $ 70 month . tesla electric operating asset intelligent way benefit grid , tesla electric basically software developed autobidder purpose distributed energy resource , actually pay customer bring energy service grid . 's happened australia last year . 's always little bit special case . represent future , south unidentified speakeraustralia particular , solar wind supplied 70 % south australia 's energy 2022 compare 30 % texas 35 % california . -- indication headed centralized distributed storage resource , providing key unlocking fully renewable grid . tesla electric retail plan 're using bring bear customer product . 're rolling . first , exists , 's available texas people powerwalls home , need extend beyond . billion people live market competitive retail electricity there's 2 trillion annual energy spend market . huge opportunity . -- intention bring market-by-market way 've approached tesla insurance bring value customer reduce total cost ownership product . actually , 're going next pretty exciting texas summer , 're going offer retail electricity plan people car unlimited overnight home charging $ 30 month . part reducing total cost ownership vehicle , reason could texas ton wind , texas , wind blow night . , actually , serving customer electricity night car best thing everyone . way incentivize people charge home , night directly , renewable power . 's part grand masterplan talked beginning . 're excited see similar tesla insurance said , reducing total cost ownership electric vehicle . putting together , 're really beginning massive ramp energy storage deployment . yeah . reﬂecting back masterplan , talk ten terawatt hour -- needing ten terawatt hour stationary storage . , site set annual production rate 1 terawatt hour , 25x capacity lathrop . near term , see really strong demand megapack product , 100 gigawatt-hours per year , 2023 growing 100 gigawatt-hours per year next year . demand naturally continue focus cost speed value , thing 've mentioned , 's clear need build capacity need ramp quickly . challenge big , 's also huge opportunity tesla , 's huge opportunity megapack business . 'm excited see impact going make good transition . brandon ehrhart laurie shelbyas i. yes . alright . alright . thank . thank . yes . right glory , brandon , come . hi . 'm brandon legal team . thank . coming , investor . active engaged board management team . 've met . today culmination .

've tesla 5.5 year . 'm going talk tesla 's impact , course , start awesome team member . 've heard lot today amazing product , process , software . 've seen lot number lot graph . 've also heard common theme common theme tesla 's team drive success make difference . whether 're factory , sale , service delivery center , warehouse field , see feel collaboration 's happening . also see pride everyone working tesla . , go , want give big shout thank tesla team globally . let 's -- great . great . thank . creating lot meaningful work job . 're huge employer 're growing every day . 're 129,000 , half team work vehicle manufacturing , almost 60 % team based u.s. people want join mission , need grow , need hire best people . engineer want work tesla . look number one number two , zachary kirkhornspacex tesla . 2021 , got 3 million applicant . 3 million , 's incredible . culture , culture tesla anyone time raise idea make improvement , suggestion across safety , people , cost , production , quality , simple process called take charge . take charge really employee engagement . take charge go , see graph , injury go . know ? people work -- people work , know improve work . sustainability . sustainability everything . 's mission . 've heard day , part master plan . tesla , n't tick box meet requirement . really focus impact product software deliver . 2021 , customer avoided 8.4 million metric ton greenhouse gas . 's equivalent taking 1.7 million ice vehicle road full year . yes . 're also focusing really good work driving sustainability operation . year-over-year reduction water use , waste , 're growing building renewable energy program within operation , like supercharging heard . 's product , 's way make product , phase . tesla , company solving side clean energy equation . 've got clean generation , clean storage . also zero emission transport . slide show , 2012 2021 , product generated energy consumed tesla vehicle factory . 's amazing . yeah , like clap . yeah . 'll take clap . vehicle use le emission gas powered vehicle . even worst case scenario , 100 % coal grid . model 3 le emission average ice car , 're going get better . heard today . every product make eﬃcient , every factory build sustainable . 's going get better better . , build zero-emission future , 've talking stakeholder , shareholder improve reporting framework aligning tcdf -- tcfd . 're aligning tcfd , know many asking u . also want stay tuned 's going much coming impact report . , thank next zach kirkhorn . thank , laurie . right . last section prepared remark today . kind take 've discussed today summarize corporate level financials . maybe jump detail , 've never done investor day company . 've never brought leadership team asked talk thing 're working . , feel fortunate able work alongside group people support team . also want thank , 're room back listening , work put today getting company today . thank tesla team . preparing today , folk asking , well , zach , talk ? really guidance gave folk well , talk thing 're working , talk context master plan . almost everybody talk today great detail , work they're take cost . industry , business , survive die , based upon ability manage cost . 'd like talk cost well . look longest-running scale production product , model 3. reached 5,000 car per week , design capacity mid 2018. since 've taken 30 % cost product . 's two point want make . first cost reduction heard throughout course day deeply ingrained culture . think one important reason today company . second point want make , 're working cost reduction , 's easy take cost make product worse . take cost improve product time , hard thing , necessary thing continue move forward . look version model 3 've built today compare back model 3 built 2018 , 's long list improvement put car also taking cost product . cost reduction n't come one place . 's silver bullet . push boundary volume model 3 program , increasing volume 3x period time . 've improved productivity . fremont factory , twice productive , mid 2018. 've made lot progress overhead eﬃciencies product improvement 've discussed , long list thing including localization , factory shanghai . ramp volume find eﬃciencies , work supplier lead material cost reduction improve affordability product . look forward next-gen vehicle , target reduce 50 % cost , 've talked bit earlier today . -- going model x platform 3 platform , took 50 % cost . task . important , improve affordability , number customer access product dramatically increase , link back master plan , enables exponential growth volume linear reduction cost product . second point 'll make , cost reduction n't come single one place . see bucket vehicle side , battery powertrain , manufacturing cost reduction others , bucket relatively equal size . order take 50 % cost product , go everything . importantly cost car upfront , 're transitioning sustainable economy , particularly vehicle ownership , 's really important think lifetime cost product . chart showing total cost ownership per mile course five year . think financing cost , insurance cost , cost power , drew [ ph ] talked little bit plan texas , wear tear maintenance car , et cetera . 're already place today u.s. base model 3 cost per mile basis le toyota corolla , highest selling car world . move towards next-gen platform , continue reduce . work robotaxi variant platform , cost come even even . product -- expect substantially lower cost per mile highest volume product world . next thing cost reduction want talk operating expense . spent lot time earnings call talking gross margin product cost . n't spend lot time talking opex , think one really important part story . since 2018 , 've reduced non-gaap opex 60 % percent revenue , 75 % per delivered car basis . quite staggering , want go detail 've done . first component opex r & , single important thing constrain number program work . minimizing number program 're running parallel key maximize revenue cash generated every program work . also maximize technology sharing program . talked little bit power electronics energy business shared power electronics vehicle business . look sg & side , think , story pretty dramatic . we're showing comparison sg & per car delivered , compared traditional auto industry , oem dealership network . estimate 're 60 % 70 % lower per car basis . turn dollar , many thousand dollar per car . part reason last earnings call , made comment think operating margin gross margin company , integration sg & side , particularly vertical integration dealership network , provides eﬃciencies give u competitive advantage cost structure standpoint , relative company . thing 'll note n't always case n't long ago bar would inverted . go back little bit time , talk launched model 3 , fremont factory , went 2,000 car per week & x adding 5,000 week model 3 , got u 7,000 car week . 've heard folk today talk production hell , n't think 've ever talked company back oﬃce operation hell , also happened time . 7,000 car week , 350,000 car year . want go 20 million car year 're struggling 7,000. 're saying , completely rethink way 're managing back- oﬃce operation hope eﬃciently scaling company . began process 're still continuing work today , something refer tesla operating system . , way 're vertically integrated software manages car , 've also vertically integrated software run company . major department company using yet -- almost using in-house software . recently , removed third-party recruiting software 're running recruiting software company . matter lot rather complex web third-party system generic solution , take lot effort customize particular need , 've able put place in-house application engineering team , dedicated lightweight software need nothing . team work closely process improvement team sit within business , looking process 're managing company , following exact process tom mentioned manufacturing space look process , delete process step need , simplify process step existing , automate 's remaining . result , quite staggering frank . think 's exceeded expectation well . left side chart example eﬃciency improvement 've seen within sg & area result strategy . north american sale team four time eﬃcient 2018. order operation team , financial service , mean level improvement large 's enough pixel slide list everything . 's couple example . way look take cost product , want feature product improve product taking cost , true use tesla operating system integration process improvement team within company . 've increased performance added capability , also dramatically reducing cost per car basis . 's list self-service functionality we've put place , customer like also simplifies operation behind scene . 've used tesla operating system expand captive insurance phase , fully vertically integrated . run in-house software . agent , claim software claim folk run insurance business . also important technology company , data important use system access data system pull extremely granular targeted reporting enables u see every aspect business real time . make adjustment operation needed . sometimes , example say , man , wish tracking piece data . well , 's team 's meeting away application engineering team make request start tracking data make change . feedback loop associated process improvement , inside company pretty astounding . last thing 'll mention something 'm personally quite proud , 've made lot progress closed process within finance team , getting 10-q 10-k filed , 's amongst fastest 20 largest market cap company . great work finance team . work cost reduction extremely important , lot money spend ahead u , achieve goal within master plan . we've mentioned course day today , 20 million annual vehicle production target , 1 terawatt hour annual energy storage production , expanding cell production , service charging line growth business . 've estimated think total cost get . there's certainly error bar around number continue progress innovate , , 've spent $ 28 billion far history company . maybe total investment look large . actually think 's quite small , relative ambition . look 2022 operating cash ﬂows say , well , let 's assume modest growth , maybe much conservative , ability pay level investment forecast , achievable u . 'm often asked capital allocation . think , strategy straightforward . touched upon , little bit last slide , explicit . obviously , priority ensure 're using capital run day-to-day operation business . working capital intensive business elon r. muskand managed carefully . , course quarter , multibillion-dollar swing cash balance , depending upon timing build deliver car . obviously plenty set aside . downside protection another really important area money set aside . last couple year , throughout pandemic , think highlight ready downside protection important . preserving daily operation engine generates cash allows u reinvest growth business 'm proud last couple year , despite ups down macro environment interruption supply chain , never pulled back investment growth , remains huge priority u . investing growth , look opportunistic way spend cash . financially oriented return exceeds hurdle , place cash . part story cost reduction fremont factory . excess side , board meet regular basis , thinking cash ﬂow projection looking forward whether make sense buyback dividend . , wrap finance portion presentation today , couple key message want leave use innovation intense level , drive cost improve eﬃciency business . reason important allows u improve product affordability . particularly case move next generation platform . improving affordability allows u comfortably make investment grow volume , volume generates cash , allows u make investment . integrate going forward , 's belief leadership team tesla 're going achieve unprecedented scale manufacturing space . 's ultimately required accelerate world 's transition sustainable energy . , completes prepared portion today . 're going take short break , 'll resume live q & . thank much . right . . well , let 's see . -- probably significant announcement day 're excited announce 're going building gigafactory mexico . . yes . 'll obviously grand opening groundbreaking whatnot , 're excited announce next tesla gigafactory mexico , near monterrey . 're excited . unidentified speaker operator q - rod lache - elon r. musknow , want emphasize , continue expand production existing factory , including california , nevada , texas obviously well shanghai . intend increase production factory , giga mexico would supplemental output factory . clear , moving output anywhere anywhere , simply expanding total global output . yeah , 's going good . , yeah , -- okay , laurie . , think 's -- yeah , 're quite excited announce . fact , believe governor , 's hard see . welcome . secretary state , believe . anyway , look forward , big event great groundbreaking opening . , let 's see , move , guess , q & . 've obviously got significant bench strength . probably like bench , maybe many people stage , 'll try answer question within reason . yeah , meant kind long-term sort discussion opposed production rest quarter type thing . let 's try orient question towards long-term value creation fire away . rod ? question answer ( question answer ) hi , 's rod lache wolfe research . exciting plan next-generation vehicle powertrains battery . hoping maybe talk u little bit timeline deploying , sound like 's vehicle , 's kind paradigm change vehicle assembled ? battery put together everything ? also get reconfigured everything . , model y built built differently future . maybe give u feel happens 's timeline implementation ? well , 'll talk little bit , broadly speaking , profound architectural change future vehicle . retooling factory mean bringing factory extended period time , prefer think . variant model produced . 've got variant - unidentified speaker q - adam jonas - elon r. musk - unidentified speakerwhere 's rear casting , 's front rear casting , structural battery pack . number small improvement occur , think really , really big change , would future vehicle . yeah , know guy want add ? ( inaudible ) ? yeah . , mean far , agree 100 % , elon , 's really easy put innovation new vehicle , long-term , 'll obviously bring back . we've always talked , n't want take factory . far timeline go , 're going go fast , left right . always , elon alluded fact mexico build next gen vehicle , also plant . 's really getting running . expect huge volume product , 're going move quickly next couple year . let 's go adam . thanks . first , another winner , mexico . ( foreign language ) . 's great . congratulation . elon , question applying first principle thinking innovation area seemingly outside control , mining extraction key material . believe couple year ago , patent sodium chloride extract lithium clay , spodumene clay thing nature . -- fit plan maybe bringing real innovation mining sector could use little , maybe waking getting cost , could real gating factor seems . well , 're going address whatever think limiting factor point time . would like least amount possible . , n't want get mining refining sector . . think focus really refining capacity . need make giant [ ph ] amount anode , cathode , lithium , lithium hydroxide , lithium carbonate . 's really refining capacity biggest choke point . yeah . 's 're building lithium refinery corpus christi . term mining company , looking part value chain . large supplier lithium right -- aware 're approaching corpus refinery technology trying . reason 're making aware , think 're fundamentally scalable proved , plan share . elon say , 's really like want thing , 're 's happening fast enough . - elon r. musk - unidentified speaker q - analyst - elon r. musk - unidentified speakerso prove done faster , intention transfer knowledge large -- current supplier . actually true . 's actually clay process playing continue work . true . 've worked supplier well trial 're sharing knowledge intention help whole world better . ultimately , year getting lithium whatever ore. 're obviously building cathode processing facility , adjacent building . little road 'll see another large construction that's cathode refining . 'd prefer others . 're know , want . yes . case , n't really large-scale cathode production united state needed done . , 're going , we're going try first principle perspective . tried bunch new thing , 're confident work , prove , want bring back supplier build new facility quickly le investment . right , let 's go ben . hi . ben kehler [ ph ] baird . similar , renewable side , tesla nudge rest renewable industry speed , since big pillar master plan 3 ? well , n't know , say like entrepreneur want like guaranteed chance success , would refining lithium anode cathode material whatsoever lithium ion cell no- brainer . yes , 're everything . yeah . renewable energy thing , thing tesla reduce cost storage , reduce cost stationary storage , bring like ﬂexible load grid form like car charging right time , valuable renewables . texas , right , n't joking , like 's lot wind . night , wind -- 's like almost much wind , n't want turn nuke whatever . , bringing really low cost storage onto grid , make renewables valuable , ultimately accelerate deployment . 's focus , guess . q - analyst - unidentified speaker - elon r. musk - unidentified speaker - elon r. musk q - analystyeah , philippe . thank . 's ( inaudible ) jefferies . 've got two question . first one , think industry , everybody want tesla . every car marker trying emulate 're done . one thing n't focus much growth possible model [ ph ] possible . 'm trying understand aim 20 million unit 2030. many model think need get ? fit drive hyperscale ? manage ? also , fact probably consumer point want see tesla tesla every street corner . 'm trying get sense . question bidirectional . mean , talked lot making world renewables better usage car . think bidirectional charging one way better using car , seem reluctant past . 'm wondering latest view topic . sure . bidirectional , n't like conscious decision . n't priority time , think maybe way think . looked -- continue improve power electronics vehicle , 've found way bring bidirectionality actually reducing cost power electronics vehicle . thing tesla , goal usually get le , middle kind like power electronics retool , would say bring functionality vehicle next two year , let 's say , 's -- yeah guess 's 'll say . yeah . n't think many people going use bidirectional charging unless powerwall , unplug car house go dark , extremely inconvenient . yes . value , come charging car right time . 's really sending energy way . yes . powerwall take house load , use car supplementary energy source power wall , 're going drive everyone crazy unplugging car house go . think , 's value supplemental energy source road , powerwall , 've diminished convenience people house . - elon r. musk q - analyst - elon r. musk q - george gianarikas - elon r. musk - unidentified speakerand question number model . sorry ? many model -- vehicle model . many . really 10 , n't know . many . mean 's happened conventional car people run thing . run thing , end reshu  ing deck , pretty much . many variant car road ? 's like hundred . -- good variant ? , mostly . 're variant sake variant . -- look -- thing converged phone , used hundred ﬂip phone , ? 'll like . george gianarikas canaccord genuity . question plan grow market share china . also whether political tension united state china impact long-term ambition ? thank . hey , tom . n't sweat hard . yeah . well , 're still growing market share china , quite strongly actually . especially earlier year , price adjustment . , actually generated huge demand , produce really . elon said , long offer product value affordable price , n't worry demand . 's basically philosophy follow . try everything cut cost supply chain , improve eﬃciency factory pas add value customer . think , guy long continue , 'm concerned market share china . second part , geopolitical , one know . best . actually create lot job local community , generated also -- supplier ' factory , 'll create lot job well , contributed lot local economy . think , long 're needed country , n't see much risk . colin ? q - colin rusch - elon r. musk - unidentified speaker - elon r. musk - unidentified speaker colin rush oppenheimer . one thing struck presentation operational eﬃciency metric guy talking . could talk little bit velocity learning cycle guy track think organization , work variety area innovation perspective ? anyone want try ? 'll say one high level thing , ca n't improve something measure 're like ruthless measurer tesla . start measuring thing contribute operational eﬃciency , actually path something . , guess key good measuring stick . okay . 's something say respect demand , 've said time year , sometimes need said , -- overwhelmingly desire people tesla extremely high . limiting factor ability pay tesla , want tesla . 's easy people room lose sight . income far excess car cost , look value money , consider affordability . vast majority people , affordability driven . simply double price car could say think thing limit n't infinitely desirable car , cost $ 10 million , would n't matter , people . demand much function affordability , desire . important . one thing n't sure price elasticity demand tesla . like , lower price , much demand increase ? found even small change price big effect demand , big . good thing learn . yeah . , -- autonomy question , big , could potentially -- n't know five time utility asset currently . passenger car 10 12 hour week usage , plus lot parking expense , autonomous car could 50 60 hour week something like . could get rid lot parking expense . , true autonomy effectively turned ﬂeet . may -- probably biggest asset value increase history overnight . emmanuel ? q - emmanuel rosner - elon r. musk - unidentified speaker thank much , emmanuel rosner deutsche bank . , start launching next generation vehicle ramping volume , nearest term priority term segment vehicle focus ? slide showed two vehicle right seemed based form factor . one maybe look like van one look like maybe like smaller vehicle , like potentially model 2 guess . nearest focus term ramping next-gen vehicle ? make sure lowering price point much , cost going 50 % . 're cannibalizing demand existing vehicle . alright . demand vehicle , term desire , may well infinite . 's indistinguishable infinite point . affordability matter . make car affordable , demand go crazy basically . issue build car ? hard part building car . can't emphasize enough . hard part building car entire supply chain go car . logistics challenge extraordinary diﬃculty . thing go car scale car , everything exponential ramp . miss even one thing , matter , earthquake , ﬂood , fire , revolution . thought 've heard . part supply chain get interrupted , seizure . hard part building car far supply chain go . guy want talk supply chain though ? yeah . yeah , well , might . presentation , mentioned perfection passing grade . really need everything happen perfectly strategy mitigating different risk , anticipated n't . 's really bespoke situation , really unique subject matter expertise deep knowledge particular supply chain 're managing , come strategy . 've seen everything elon mentioned , first tariff ﬂew back forth . ocean logistics issue , chip shortage , covid , ﬂoods . fire fab japan knocked . massive covid spike malaysia , lot chip backend -- lot chip . one elon involved well . yeah , 's , -- 's nerve- wrecking . somehow work . yeah . diﬃcult , think laying foundation intimate -- tier supply chain , building control directing - elon r. muskthe different tier supply chain . 's way trying mitigate risk come . , dual sourcing , triple sourcing , redundancy way 've trying mitigate . yes . 's fine . think vehicle , think three wire architecture , sx architecture , next generation platform one segment . really , 're thinking segment available n't captured , market would , designing supply chain partner , go quickly segment need . elon 's point , make car desirable affordable , oftentimes n't necessarily matter segment 's , 's one want . 've seen model 3 , lot people thought sedan going great hit , sell ton . next generation platform one vehicle , multiple 's segment , really try focus affordability desirability point started . yes , mean 's -- think , 's old saying like battle tactic logistics . logistics challenge enormous . start like significant percentage industry , ca n't overcapacitize , 's realistic . thing , like said , like dual source triple source , maybe small thing , ca n't big thing . 're triple sourced , one -- 's like plane three engine , three engine fails , crash . either overcapacitize , drive capex idle supplier somewhere big warehouse design overage 's reasonable , expedited cost , inevitably 's something go wrong somewhere , got ﬂy thing around . 's really rate progress rate able scale 10,000 logistics problem . significant cell production . , actually deliberately try overdo cell production cell supply exceed needed vehicle , go 's needed vehicle factory stall . , extra cell ? 's like , well , okay , much easier thing scale , powerwall megapack output stationary storage . overcapacitize cell pack , scale production stationary storage , much easier scale vehicle production . 's strategically think good thing . yes , capex megapack tiny , compared capex vehicle . also , megapack demand quasi-infinite . basically , long competitive utility , 're going tell many . quasi infinite demand really multi- - unidentified speaker q - dan levy - unidentified speakertera -- many terawatt hour got long way go get many terawatt hour per year . dan . let 's go dan . thank , dan levy , barclays . think know competitive dynamic differ significantly region , cost dynamic differ region . saw china gigafactory , far superior cost ( inaudible ) factory , 're clearly different dynamic . extent cost strategy 've laid today , differ region global one-size- fits-all approach reducing cost ? yeah , think 're pretty consistent strategy , try much localize possible . like china , 95 % -- 95 % supply chain localized , way first-tier second tier third tier . gave u -- generated tremendous saving cog . also localized labor force , access skilled labor force region , yangtze delta region shanghai , 'm particularly referring . among 30,000 employee china , probably le 20 expat . deep localization done , able cost structure . try replicate approach elsewhere , different giga factory . course , supplier base different . labor market different , region region country country , try best localize . yeah , think absolutely give u advantage compete auto em around globe . another thing direct [ ph ] selling mode , like zach said , would save tremendous money opex well . full control expenditure across company . n't spend money marketing advertising . everything saved become -- value offer consumer . part also follow pretty consistent strategy year . mean , certainly manufacturing stuff colin , pete talked , whether make make europe , make asia , applies everywhere . think ground , specific region . yes , one thing would add tom 's point localization lars ' [ ph ] point , would actually say 're moving direction standardization term factory , process , cost reduction approach . , 've thinking next generation platform , we've thinking volume aspire build , many individual factory need build ? fastest possible way expand footprint around world . q - analyst - zachary kirkhorn q - ashok elluswamywhat 've done model factory incremental improvement previous factory , requires engineering hour , engineering spend factory design , end factory slightly different . move towards next generation platform , think term used lars copy-paste . get right first time , certainly thing learn make adjustment , try much standardization communalization possible , allows u go quickly possible expansion . ( inaudible ) thanks . two question . one zach , one ashok . , zach , think long-term growth operating margin business ? look $ 150 billion $ 175 billion capex , remaining balance essentially capex guidance 2030. ashok , multi-trip reconstruction highlighted , different mobile light , rem map ? give u color ap hardware ? respect operating margin , intend continue improve operating expense percentage revenue time 're continuing take cost product try keep gross margin place 's healthy well . hardware perspective business , know 's expectation 'll continue stay healthy place time . 's software portion 's top . elon commented many time impact full self- driving software economics business . space , profitability operating margin would impacted dramatically . specifically point capex guidance , intent slide provide specific guidance , transparent internally rough estimate provide context think getting 20 million vehicle per year , one terawatt hour energy storage feasible , relative expected cash generation business . 's number 'll move learn . may choose vertically integrate thing . may find eﬃciencies elsewhere , whole conversation 're earlier mining , mining . entire point say something 's entirely possible , based upon forecast . regarding multi-trip reconstruction , point trying make want auto label data collect data ﬂeet , reconstruct local area act supervision trip . since want build scalable , self-driving system , n't want really rely hd map - elon r. musk - unidentified speaker q - alex potter - andrew d. baglinoanything , even though could like trivially build something using technology , mostly auto leveling . provides like precise 3d label video sequence involved reconstruction . 's something n't know touched much , term training one biggest neural , net training system world , expect increase believe order magnitude end year probably another order magnitude end next year combination nvidia dojo . , much scale quite ( inaudible ) people . 's enormous . maybe final two question , one alex one chris . okay . alex potter piper . , definitely want ask drew anybody else update dry battery electrode , right ? , try over-capacitize towards cell , scale , lot , clearly 's lot moving piece , 's complex sort orchestra supply chain , lot come drive battery electrode , least . , trending , fascinating part factory tour looking window seeing clearly science project , anything 're willing disclose yield progress today versus thought going . yeah , thanks . yes . mean saw right , like real factory making lot dry electrode automated fashion . 've made lot progress . 's spectrum like , we're perfectionist clear end goal , -- every week go , making progress towards end goal , whether 's speed tool , yield process downstream process . installed yet rate progress either , 's anode cathode side . think great thing overcapacity elon mentioned 's giving u opportunity experiment go , rather like stock something happen kick year-and-a-half ago , something elon said team , many time okay scrap equipment money . 's okay scrap time . , way 've approaching u probabilistically think likely thing succeed , even actually factory saw one anode line , actually operating two slightly different version final process step powder entering tool 's competition . going higher yield , going perform better ? - elon r. musk - unidentified speaker operator - unidentified speaker - elon r. musk - unidentified speakerluxury able , 're taking full advantage advance technology quickly possible . dry electrode problem really quite hard problem . acquired maxwell really dry electrode technology , illustrates gigantic gap something working small scale large scale . 've extremely talented team engineer working , scaling dry electrode process reliable consistent . 've grinding hard literally figuratively quite . seems likely able scale volume year . yes . yes . mean 're basically increasing output week week , like roughly 1,000 week per quarter internal target , 're tracking . think -- saw effectively like ton material per hour per tool . 's kind like hard like rationalize like really mean . 's , , 's different like , oh something work lab . 's like , 's ton material per hour , 's different kind problem like -- even like 0.1 % escape like find enclosure equipment , dust problem like could short electronics . 's like -- thing like , 're lab scale , even notice . 're thousand ton course month , 's like , oh , new failure mode found 's 're . we're knocking though . team grinding . progress every week . last question chris . thanks taking question . follow-up next-gen vehicle . first , think 'll get look , maybe prototype . second , detail think share term size , content , performance . third , think mentioned would produce plant addition mexico , take mean launch existing plant 're finished constructing new plant mexico ? think 'll actually probably decline answer . proper sort product event , would jumping gun answer question . maybe another question , 's . yes . n't know , anyone . q - analyst - elon r. musk q - ashok elluswamy - elon r. musk q - ashok elluswamy - elon r. musk q - ashok elluswamy - elon r. muskwell , ( inaudible ) two question . really impressive afternoon . thank much . elon , 'm curious 've doubled 'll double , -- 've learned sort managing larger enterprise , might manage bigger enterprise . , secondly , 'm curious thought generative ai rapid breakthrough ai last month could help make car sort le hard make ? thank . n't see ai helping u make car anytime soon . point , mean , -- point u working . big problem , 'll chill . mean , 'm little worried ai stuff . think 's something , n't know , concerned . n't think . think need kind like regulatory authority something 's overseeing ai development making sure 's operating within public interest . 's quite dangerous technology . fear , may done thing accelerate , , n't know . , ai stuff think 's obviously useful , like 're self-driving , people think agi type problem . n't think quite agi problem , certainly requires sophisticated neural net , road system designed eye biological neural net . naturally , analog camera digital neural net . thing found , actually look neural net architecture cart , kind insane frankly - net upon net upon net upon net . yeah . visualization tool crash , open . yeah . 's complicated . yeah . 's like complicated . one visualize right . - unidentified speaker - elon r. musk - unidentified speakeryeah , 's hard -- like literally look insane . guess something like that's happening brain drive around , pretty well . , n't know , like tesla 's good thing ai -- n't know , one stress . n't know think , say . n't know . okay . given 's 7 o'clock , think 's time . thank much coming -- . thank . see later .
