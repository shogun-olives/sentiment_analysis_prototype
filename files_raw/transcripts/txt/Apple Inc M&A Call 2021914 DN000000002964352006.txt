Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I really love the incredible energy in
that opening. It represents the way we feel about California. California has always
been a place for people with big ambitions and big dreams. A place where people
are fueled with optimism to make things better, to make things that can change the
world. It is such an important part of who we are at Apple, and inspires us in
everything we create and do. We're proud to call, California our home. We have a lot
to talk about today.
Let's get started with Apple TV+. Apple TV+ is a home to the world's most creative
storytellers and continues to expand with award-winning programming. Apple
Original series, ﬁlms and documentaries have now been honored with more than a
130 wins and over 500 nominations in less than two years. We're still proud this year
that Apple TV+ has 35 Primetime Emmy nominations, including 20 for Ted Lasso, our
record for the ﬁrst season of a comedy series. And we're just getting started. Let's
take a quick look at a few shows that are premiering this fall.
(Video Presentation)
I can't wait for all the new shows and movies coming to Apple TV+, including the
second season are one of my favorites. The Morning Show, which starts this Friday.
Next, we are thrilled to share our newest product announcements. Starting with iPad.
There is no other device like iPad, and today it's more popular and more essential
than ever. And the reason it's so popular is it's amazing versatility. They can transform
into whatever you needed to be. With advanced displays users can literally touch
their content unlike any other device. With powerful and eﬃcient Apple design
chips, iPad delivers breathtaking performance all day long. And with fast
connectivity, advanced cameras and accessories like the Magic Keyboard and AppleFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-14

where they can do it.
At the heart of it all, is iPad OS, delivering powerful features while maintaining the
simplicity of a touch ﬁrst experience. What makes iPad even more versatile or the
over one million apps designed speciﬁcally for it's large cameras. The iPad business
has never been stronger. We've grown by over 40% this past year. We have a great
line-up today with industry-leading customer satisfaction, and it's about to get even
stronger. It starts with our most popular iPad, which delivers the full iPad experience
at an incredibly aﬀordable price. And today it gets even better. This is the new iPad.
And to tell you all about it, here's Melody.
This new iPad is packed full of updates. So let's jump in. Under the hood is the more
powerful chip, A13 Bionic, and it pushes even further than the speedy A12 from last
year's iPad, with 20% faster performance in every aspect of the chip, from the CPU
and GPU to the neural engine. A13 is leaps ahead of the competition. In fact, it makes
this iPad up to three times faster than the best-selling Chromebook, and up to six
times faster than the best-selling Android tablet. And it means users will see even
more responsive performance for all the things they love to do on iPad.
From everyday uses like messaging and browsing the web, to playing immersive
high-quality games, and as users explore more advanced apps like Adobe Fresco
with its super realistic water colors, A13 delivers the performance they need and then
some. And the more powerful neural engine in A13 makes next generation machine
learning experiences like Live Text in iPad OS 15 even faster. The upgraded image
signal processor in A13 also means the real camera captures great photos with
improved autofocus in low light and better selﬁes from the front camera as well. Now
the front camera on iPad is essential for things like remote learning and connecting
with family, and that's why we're so thrilled to give it a big upgrade. It's now a 12
megapixel Ultra Wide camera that produces a huge leap in image quality and
enables a super popular feature from iPad Pro. And that's Center Stage.
We're bringing the magical Center Stage experience from iPad Pro to this new iPad,
enabled by the Ultra Wide front camera and the neural engine. Center Stage makes
video calls more engaging by automatically detecting people and dynamically
adjusting the frame as they move around or as more people join in. It works in
landscape orientation and portrait, so users can enjoy Center Stage in all the ways
they use iPad. Not only does Center Stage work in base time, it makes video calls
more natural and other popular apps like Zoom, BlueJeans and WebEx, and it's not
just for video conferencing, users can record stream and post Center Stage video in
apps like Double-Tick explain everything and TikTok. It makes you more productive
on iPad, and it's simply more fun.
Another new feature coming to this iPad that users love is True Tone. It adjusts the
display. It's the color temperature of a room to provide a more comfortable viewingFINAL TRANSCRIPT 2021-09-14

Unidentiﬁed Speakerexperience. And by retaining the same popular design, this iPad supports a vast
array of accessories, including the Thin and Light Smart Keyboard and third-party
keyboards like Logitech's latest Rugged Combo with Trackpad for schools. And of
course this iPad supports the ﬁrst generation Apple Pencil, where iPad OS makes the
experience of using Apple Pencil as easy a natural as Pen And Paper. And this new
iPad will ship with iPad OS 15, which is packed with great new features.
For example, you can place widgets among your apps, making important
information available with just a glance. New multitasking controls make it even
easier to launch and use multiple apps. Quick Note gives you a fast and easy way to
take notes anywhere, and the list goes on. iPad OS is so immensely capable and so
easy to use. When you combine it with a beautiful display, great cameras, broad
accessory support, gigabit class LTE, and all-day battery life, this iPad delivers
enormous value, because this new iPad starts at just 329, and that's with twice the
storage, starting at 64-gigabytes. For schools, it's even more aﬀordable at just 299. It
comes in Space Gray and Silver and cellular models are available as well. You can
order the new iPad today, and it will be available next week. With the power of A13
Bionic, a new 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera with Center Stage, True Tone,
double the storage and the versatility of iPad OS 15. This is a giant upgrade for our
most popular iPad.
Now back to Tim.
{BIO 14014370 <GO>}
We're excited that our most popular iPad is now so much better. And now, let's talk
about iPad Mini. There is simply no other device like iPad Mini. It gives users all the
power of iPad, it is most portable form, which makes it indispensable for a wide
range of uses like when it secured to the lack of a pilot in ﬂight, are pulled from a
doctor's lab coat to care for patients in the ER. iPad Mini is in a class of its own. And
today, we're giving our little less iPad, its biggest upgrade ever. Introducing the all-
new iPad Mini.
As Tim said, we're giving iPad Mini a huge set of updates. Our complete redesign
that puts everything our users love about iPad, right in the palm of their hand. The
all-new enclosure features a beautiful all screen design with narrow borders and
elegant rounded corners. The design is remarkably thin and light and absolutely
stunning. And iPad Mini now comes in a gorgeous array of new colors, purple, pink,
starlight, and space gray. And this design features a brilliant Liquid Retina display.
With this new design, we were able to increase the screen size all the way out to 8.3
inches, while keeping the same compact footprint with wide color, True Tone, 500
nits of brightness and the lowest reﬂectivity in the industry, everything you view on
iPad Mini will look great, wherever you go. And delivering this edge to edge screen,
meant ﬁnding a new location for Touch ID. So just like iPad Air, we put it right in the
top button of iPad Mini.
